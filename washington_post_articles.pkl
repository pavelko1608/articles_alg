VBy Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto\u000a\u000aNearly three-quarters of Americans are uneasy about the possibility of conflict with North Korea, and most feel that way about President Donald Trump's approach to the situation.\u000a\u000aA majority think North Korea is using its missile program to try to gain power and influence, rather than outright planning a nuclear strike on the U.S. Nevertheless, that unease remains.\u000a\u000aCBS News Poll\u000a\u000aMost Americans still call North Korea a threat that can be contained \u2013 and the overall number who believe it requires military action is not much changed from April.\u000a\u000aCBS News Poll\u000a\u000aAs in the spring, a majority remains uneasy about President Donald Trump's ability to handle the situation with North Korea's nuclear program. Only a third are confident in his ability.\u000a\u000aCBS News Poll\u000a\u000aMost people who think North Korea is posturing think it is a threat that can be contained, while most people who think they are actively planning a strike say military action is required now.\u000a\u000aThis poll was conducted by telephone August 3-6, 2017 among a random sample of 1,111 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

aVIn 2010, 26-year-old Mark Zuckerberg announced on The Oprah Winfrey Show that he was donating $100 million to Newark public schools. His partners, then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, outlined a broad five-year plan to change the future of education in the crime-ridden, poverty-stricken city, where nearly half of the public-school students drop out of high school. Describing a scene in her new book, The Prize, the longtime Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, who also volunteered as a tutor in the district, writes that when it was Zuckerberg's turn in the TV interview to speak, the Facebook co-founder wasn\u2019t able to finish his opening sentence. At his mention of the $100 million, Oprah interrupted and repeated the number for dramatic effect. The audience exploded. Oprah whooped. Booker, Christie, and audience members stood and applauded. According to Russakoff, Zuckerberg blushed in his seat.\u000a\u000aInspired by his wife (and then-girlfriend) Priscilla Chan\u2019s brief stints as a teacher, and based on his impression that teaching as a profession was undervalued, Zuckerberg wanted to make a contribution to education. While on the show, once the applause died down, he resumed his announcement, citing his desire to see Booker and Christie \u201cturn Newark into a symbol of educational excellence for the whole nation.\u201d The preemptive celebration was telling. There was a mission that had been vaguely articulated by two charismatic, ambitious politicians to improve the lives for what Russakoff calculates to be more than 38,000 of America\u2019s most disadvantaged children. There was a huge pile of money, with the promise of another $100 million in matching donations from corporate investors and philanthropists courted by Booker. To the television audience of typical Americans, the union of celebrity politicians, crusader rhetoric, and a $200 million gift sparked an attack of the warm fuzzies. Philanthropic foundations including that of Bill and Melinda Gates, Eli and Edythe Broad, and the Walton Family spend nearly $4 billion a year on supporting public K-12 education in America. Zuckerberg\u2019s generous gift was unique in the sense that he was investing in an effort that tasked politicians with tackling an entire district\u2019s shortcomings. Without taking an ideological stance in the contentious public debates about the direction of education in America, Russakoff shows readers how a dreamy-seeming union of idealists, money, and opportunity might breed confusion and conflict as readily as hope and renewal. She underscores the maddening complexities of reinvigorating and managing a struggling school system in a downtrodden urban area. Some education reformers characterize teachers\u2019 unions as a major impediment to progress, but The Prize dives into the whole stew of potential obstacles. As the Newark example demonstrates, when it comes to handling a $1 billion budget (particularly one enhanced by philanthropists\u2019 gifts), school and district administrators, for-profit education consultants, and politicians have much at stake besides improving test scores and vanquishing socioeconomic inequality. Parents and teachers alike may not harbor any love for a bloated school district\u2019s inefficient, ineffective status quo. Nonetheless, they may resist a message of change when they feel the messengers\u2019 tone and tactics are condescending, even \u201ccolonial,\u201d as one school board member puts it to Russakoff. For instance, the son of famous late poet and longtime Newark resident Amiri Baraka, Ras Baraka, an educator and Booker\u2019s eventual replacement as mayor, didn\u2019t like seniority protections for teachers either. However, he was even more turned off by what he called \u201cdictatorial bullying\u201d disguised as cooperation. In the notoriously tough Newark, inadequate social services may keep kids traumatized by crime, poverty, drugs, and abuse from embracing the identity of student, even if higher-quality teachers are recruited to take over the education of these children. Zuckerberg\u2019s generous gift tasked politicians with tackling an entire district\u2019s shortcomings. Impeccably researched and originally serialized in The New Yorker, The Prize makes some sense of this Great American Disaster. It shows how well-intentioned reform-minded outsiders may wade clumsily into a school system\u2019s entrenched webs of traditions, allegiances, cultural habits, and underlying conditions. Like an army trying to maintain control over occupied territory\u2014while simultaneously playing Whack-a-Mole with the problems that pop up\u2014they may make more of a mess than the one they mop up.\u000a\u000aRussakoff pulls readers in with richly drawn real-world characters. The Cory Booker she portrays is a \u201cpolitician of the future.\u201d (The Democrat has since taken office as a U.S. Senator.) He shines on the Sundance Channel documentary show Brick City and made headlines rescuing a neighbor from a burning building\u2014an act he immediately shared on Twitter. On an episode of her show after the Oprah announcement, Ellen DeGeneres hands him a Superman costume and calls him \u201cYour Excellency.\u201d He\u2019s spent so much time networking on social media, visiting other cities, and appearing on TV shows that the writer Amiri Baraka, according to Russakoff, dubbed him \u201cThe Virtual One.\u201d Booker may have charmed the don of Earth\u2019s most traversed virtual world, but Russakoff\u2019s reporting remains balanced. She gained intimate access to many of the powerful individuals involved in the Newark initiative and factored in their perspectives along with the stories of teachers, principals, parents, and students. The politicians had monumental hopes. Facing poor outcomes, complacency, and bureaucratic clutter, Booker, who didn\u2019t attend Newark\u2019s public schools, promised that the city would witness \u201ctransformative,\u201d not \u201cincremental,\u201d reform. He also pledged that this work would be \u201cthe people\u2019s project.\u201d Instead of starting with the input of teachers, parents, and students, they hired Cami Anderson, a white woman who had the reputation of \u2018not playing well in the sandbox with others.\u201d Christie appointed as his education commissioner Christopher Cerf, the founder of the consulting firm Global Education Advisors and the former self-styled \u201cchief of transformation\u201d who helped spearhead former New York City schools Chancellor Joel Klein\u2019s redesign of the district. \u201cChange has casualties,\u201d Cerf said to a group of community and business leaders. The key, he told school investors on another occasion, was that, \u201cyou have to override political infrastructure.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the Christie administration, overriding the infrastructure involved hiring waves of for-profit education consultants shortly after the Oprah announcement\u2014including a $3 million contract for Cerf\u2019s old firm. Russakoff reported that a total of $21 million of the $200 million donation ended up going to \u201ctechnocrats\u201d who commuted from Manhattan with high salaries amounting to as much as $1,000 a day. These consultants were skilled at marketing reform efforts, developing systems for evaluating teachers, designing data systems, and reorganizing bureaucratic hierarchies. They didn\u2019t know the community or interact with students in person, but, according to Russakoff\u2019s account, were fluent in education-reform jargon. In a poor, predominantly black and Latino district, their whiteness, high salaries, and talk of \u201cmoving the needle\u201d created tension not only with the on-the-ground employees they were tasked with motivating but also the school board and the union. Booker promised that the city would witness \u201ctransformative,\u201d not \u201cincremental,\u201d reform. There were other casualties. Money was funneled toward agonizing union negotiations as part of efforts to amend the teachers\u2019 contract\u2014including $30 million in back pay as a compromise in exchange for a merit-based pay system\u2014and positions which didn\u2019t entail direct, meaningful contact with students, like teacher coaches and curriculum-design experts. These hires, according to Russakoff, detracted funding that could\u2019ve been otherwise spent on early-childhood education classrooms, G.E.D. and continuing-education programs, and additional teachers, which could have reduced class sizes.\u000a\u000aAmid the grant-led reform initiative, the ambitious Booker and Christie moved on to campaigns for higher office in 2013 and 2015, respectively. (Christie also seriously considered running for president in 2012.) Newark\u2019s public-school enrollment dropped as children transferred to charter schools, which as of the book\u2019s completion, reportedly served 40 percent of the city\u2019s children. These shifts took a toll on schools\u2019 budget. The drop in the traditional public-school population led to school closures and a purge of more recent hires. Christie, Booker, and Cerf advocated for the expansion of charter schools, but, despite Anderson\u2019s warnings, apparently failed to consider the effect this might have on the district\u2019s remaining students, many of whom had to attend new schools and cope with larger classes and fewer resources. Ultimately, Russakoff shows how dramatically overhauling a school system in the name of education might disrupt a community and hurt students. Russakoff\u2019s observations offer searing, though indirect, commentary on the outcomes of the $200 million project. The book is rife with spectacular examples of reformers defining their success exclusively on their own terms. Anderson, for example, tied her own pay bonuses to education gains finalized close to the end of the year. Russakoff memorably analogizes that move to tailoring an answer key to a test-taker\u2019s responses; Anderson never missed a bonus, perhaps because she could decide on the goals once she knew the results. Still, Russakoff gives Anderson her due. Student registration, for example, unfolded with unprecedented smoothness; she freed principals from having to attend to rote paperwork so they could coach teachers in the classrooms; she recognized that trimming fat in the district would eliminate jobs integral to a stable community.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Russakoff also notes how, at a 2013 event celebrating her first two years in office, Anderson gave a speech to charter-school advocates, consultants, and civic leaders in a room plastered with posters inaccurately hailing her accomplishments. It wasn\u2019t a public event, barring potentially frustrated Newark parents from crashing the party. In a follow-up questionnaire, she asked attendees for feedback about the posters, but the choices for each response excluded options that would allow negative feedback; the choices ranged from neutral to intensely positive. \u201cTwo hundred million dollars and almost five years later, there was at least as much rancor as reform.\u201d Plant metaphors help illustrate the rhetoric of American education reform. Dead schools require greener thumbs. The husks of once-formidable teachers and principals are yanked from stubborn perches. New visions refresh tired soil. Students rise like fresh stalks. Booker spoke early on in the initiative of breaking an \u201ciceberg of immovable ... failing schools\u201d and letting them \u201cmelt into many different school models.\u201d He said that they would \u201cflower, just like cherry blossoms.\u201d What actually happened fell short of the imagined transformation. Newark was a hard place to get a good public education, and it still is. Some, but hardly all, of the charter schools are performing well, but test scores elsewhere are uneven. Since 2011, 60 percent of principals across the district departed their positions. And while graduation rates have somewhat improved, the general consensus seems to be that that status quo persists. The district\u2019s future is tenuous amid budget cuts and layoffs. \u201cTwo hundred million dollars and almost five years later,\u201d writes Russakoff, \u201cthere was at least as much rancor as reform.\u201d

aVIn the long-running debate over housing subsidies, experts tend to focus on the mortgage interest deduction, a $70 billion tax break that functions as an expensive subsidy for wealthy Americans. But there are lesser-known government programs that also have the same problem\u2014and are ripe for reform. We don\u2019t think of them this way, but one of them is flood insurance.\u000a\u000aSince 1968, the federal government has provided subsidized insurance for homeowners who live in flood-prone areas\u2014a program known as the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It was created after a Department of Housing and Urban Development study in 1968 recommended the federal government provide flood insurance, arguing that a government insurance program could better balance goals of mitigation and economic development in flood plains than the private market. As of 2016, the NFIP has over 5 million policies in force and saves policyholders around $3 billion annually. But the program is out of control: It is currently $24 billion in debt; future costs will be much higher.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that Congress has a perfect opportunity to reform the program, since the NFIP must be reauthorized by the end of September. It\u2019s time to implement real reforms that put the program on sound fiscal footing\u2014and reduce this regressive housing subsidy.\u000a\u000aThe NFIP\u2019s main problem is that it doesn't really function like private insurance. For instance, it does not assess flood risk for each property; instead, premiums reflect average historical losses within a property\u2019s risk zone. Moreover, the floodplain maps determining a property\u2019s risk zone are often several decades out of date. As a result, premiums may bear only a tangential relationship to the true risk of flooding. The cost of an NFIP policy averages about half of what would be a market rate. Congress actually mandates this inaccurate pricing method. In 2014, it hastily revoked a few tentative steps at reform after constituents complained loudly when the NFIP tried to charge something approximating market rates for flood insurance.\u000a\u000aWho benefits from flood insurance? People in flood-prone states like Louisiana and Florida, of course. But many beneficiaries also share another characteristic: they are upper income. Evidence suggests that recipients of flood insurance are on average wealthier than the typical homeowner. A Congressional Budget Office study found the median value of an NFIP insured home is about twice that of American homes in general. About 80 percent of NFIP households are in counties that rank in the top income quintile. As of 2012, 42 percent of NFIP properties took out the maximum $250,000 in coverage, reflecting the fact that properties near water tend to be more expensive than properties in general.\u000a\u000aWealthier households also tend to receive larger subsidies. A University of Massachusetts study examined the relationship between property values and premiums paid per $100,000 in coverage in that state, finding a negative relationship between property value and premium cost. For example, homeowners on Martha\u2019s Vineyard pay an average premium of $400 per $100,000, while residents of Fairhaven, a blue-collar town with a median household income of about $40,000, pay over $800. These numbers reflect the impact of the NFIP\u2019s explicit subsidies to homes built before the first Federal Emergency Management Agency flood map of a given area, which constitute 15-20 percent of the total policies in the program. Policyholders receive a 60-65 percent discount for these properties.\u000a\u000aNFIP recipients are also heavily concentrated along the coasts of the states in the Southeast, and about 25 percent of explicitly subsidized coastal NFIP properties are vacation homes, according to the CBO. One of these homeowners receiving government money to live on the beach was John Stossel, the former ABC and Fox News pundit. He saved thousands annually on insurance for his waterfront property in New York.\u000a\u000aThe NFIP does not charge nearly enough to cover the expected costs of its liabilities. The assessments are not sufficient to build any buffer to cover an extraordinary year, such as what occurred with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Because homeowners don\u2019t incur the full cost of building in a flood zone we end up with more houses there than if homeowners incurred the full cost of the flood risk, which exacerbates the government\u2019s costs in the next disaster. Since 1970, the number of Americans living in FEMA-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas has increased from 10 million to over 16 million today.\u000a\u000aThe optimal solution would be for the government to get out of the flood insurance business entirely and leave it to the private market, which would endeavor to accurately measure risk and charge a price for its insurance that covers the expected costs.\u000a\u000aWhile full privatization may not be politically feasible now, Congress could enact reforms that allow private insurers to compete with the NFIP on a level playing field and introduce a modicum of market discipline on the market. For example, mandating FEMA to release property-level flood data would greatly benefit private insurers. Reforms to improve actuarial fairness and the quality of mapping in the NFIP would also be welcome.\u000a\u000aThe Southeast Atlantic Coast senators are sure to object to any changes that might make their constituents pay more, watering down good reforms that already passed the House. But these senators are missing the forest for the trees. Allowing private market competition in the flood insurance industry would save the government money in a markedly progressive fashion\u2014something that should transcend ideological and geographical differences.\u000a\u000aSmart reforms would also help Congress refrain from throwing money at disasters, bailing out homeowners who shouldn\u2019t have built in flood-prone areas to begin with. Sensible long-run incentives to mitigate damage would discourage such homebuilding by exposing homeowners and businesses to the real cost of building in floodplains.\u000a\u000aThe key is to act well in advance of the next disaster. Without new legislation, we will assuredly be bailing out wealthy homeowners once again before too long.\u000a\u000aIke Brannon is a visiting fellow at the Cato Institute, and Ari Blask is a former research assistant at Cato\u2019s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and a 1L at Columbia Law School.

aVThe European Union is in good shape, and that\u2019s in part down to Jean-Claude Juncker, according to \u2026 Jean-Claude Juncker.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission president, one of the few people left in the Commission this week before he heads off on a summer break, told POLITICO that despite a challenging year, the bloc is in the mood to tackle any problems that come its way \u2014 including Brexit and Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is really nothing to complain about,\u201d he said in his office on the 13th floor of the Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters. With recent figures showing economic growth and falling unemployment, and with the budget deficits of member countries decreasing, \u201cthere is something better to report than a year ago\u201d and that\u2019s \u201cnot dependent on my mood, but on facts.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow big a share of the credit does the Commission get for that? It should be sizable, Juncker said, but in reality it\u2019s \u201crelatively small,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201ctoo old, too experienced\u201d to be bothered by national capitals claiming the credit and Brussels getting the blame.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a pattern likely to be seen in the Brexit talks, and Juncker said he had every reason to believe that would be the case.\u000a\u000aBrexit won\u2019t be just an annoyance, he said, more of a headache. \u201cPeople will become more and more conscious of the density of problems on a daily basis, without always being able to provide a coherent answer to these problems.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are better organized than the Trump administration \u2026 if there are any internal difficulties, those difficulties are fixed in a direct conversation instead of by firing people\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000aBut Juncker showed little support for the idea that the Brexit process could be reversed as the talks become fractious.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s \u201cworking hypothesis\u201d is that Brexit will happen, eventually. \u201cI don\u2019t go as far as the Maltese prime minister [Joseph Muscat] who has not ruled out that it will not come to Brexit,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cMy working hypothesis is that it will come to Brexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking in German late on Tuesday afternoon, Juncker repeated what has become a mantra for EU leaders: that Brexit talks are in good hands with Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator. That means Juncker only spends \u201cas much time as it needs\u201d on Brexit, without specifying a time, he said; his chief of staff Martin Selmayr in May said the Commission boss wouldn\u2019t devote more than half an hour a week dealing with Brexit. Instead, Juncker said, he\u2019s focused on \u201cthe EU\u2019s positive agenda\u201d such as \u201ceconomic growth and investments, migration and security, the development of a common defense policy, and strengthening our trade relationships with Japan, Canada and Latin America.\u201d\u000a\u000aJuncker vs. Trump\u000a\u000aThe Commission president didn\u2019t hold back when it came to Donald Trump, saying that he had already \u201cexplained\u201d to the U.S. president that he \u201cshould stop wishing for others to imitate the British\u201d by leaving the bloc.\u000a\u000aHe also mocked Trump for the disorganized way in which he oversees the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d Juncker said when asked about recent events in Washington, culminating in the firing of Anthony Scaramucci as comms director after just 10 days in the role.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are better organized than the Trump administration. That is because if there are any internal difficulties, those difficulties are fixed in a direct conversation instead of by firing people,\u201d Juncker said, noting that he had no reason to fire anyone.\u000a\u000aIf the EU was falling to pieces, as Trump has claimed, \u201cthe western Balkans would lose the European perspective,\u201d Juncker said in the interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of the western Balkans joining the EU soon,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cBut if you take away the European perspective, then we will again experience what we experienced in the 1990s. In this respect, the stability of the composition of the European Union is a prerequisite for the Balkans not being at war again. I hope [Trump] understood that.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that Trump hadn\u2019t of late repeated his call for other EU members to leave the bloc.\u000a\u000aJuncker said his track record since coming into office in 2014 helped him cope with the arrival of Trump and the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Commission had not ensured that Greece was not expelled from the eurozone in 2015, the balance would be less good,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cAt the time, I fought hard for the stability of the Eurogroup, in particular for Greece [against the wishes of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble]. If I hadn\u2019t done that, the eurozone would have decayed.\u201d\u000a\u000aDifficult neighbors\u000a\u000aJuncker did acknowledge that Europe faces problems, including with Poland and Hungary, which have refused to accept refugees under the EU\u2019s relocation scheme and come under criticism from Brussels for allegedly undermining the rule of law.

We talk regularly, I see him regularly \u2014 even if it\u2019s not always made public \u2014 because I think I do not want to lose Hungary.\u201d He didn\u2019t make the same pledge about Poland, or even mention it.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of noisy neighbors, Juncker said enlargement talks with Turkey should not be halted, on paper at least. That goes against the line taken by the European Parliament and by the government of Austria, both of which have called for an end to the stalled talks in the wake of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown on opponents.\u000a\u000a\u201cTurkey is our neighbor, we can\u2019t simply let it slip into oblivion,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cI am not in favor of ending the accession talks with Turkey, which is a demand from the European Parliament.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause there is the European Union, war doesn\u2019t need to happen\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the fact is that Turkey is moving away from its self-imposed obligation to become a member of the European Union almost every minute. It\u2019s not the European Union that joins Turkey, but it\u2019s Turkey joining the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aSummer reading list\u000a\u000aJuncker heads off on vacation soon, to Austria. He\u2019ll be taking books by Turkish Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk (\u201cdifficult to read\u201d) and a crime thriller \u201cthat talks about Trump, Clinton, Bush. And because I know these guys and don\u2019t see them described accurately, I\u2019ll write the author a letter.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso on the summer reading list will be \u201c1913: The year before the storm,\u201d by German writer Florian Illies, which Juncker has read before and recommended \u201cto the young people here at the Commission.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a book \u201cdescribing the situation in 1913 in a mood of peacefulness all over Europe. Then the war broke out. I can\u2019t get rid of the thought that it can happen again. But because there is the European Union, it doesn\u2019t need to happen.\u201d

aVPARIS \u2014 The next leader of France\u2019s conservative establishment could well be a fiercely ambitious young man with an immigrant background and zero qualms about betraying his own camp.\u000a\u000aIn other words, a new Nicolas Sarkozy.\u000a\u000aGérald Darmanin, now minister of public accounts, was for years a card-carrying member of Les Républicains, the country\u2019s main conservative party, and a protégé of Sarkozy. Then he defected, joined Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist camp and was rewarded with a high-profile finance ministry job. He\u2019s never publicly spoken about returning to Les Républicains and taking over as leader, but that\u2019s what many think he\u2019s planning.\u000a\u000aWhen the time is right, allies and critics believe, Darmanin will break away from Macron and offer himself up as the savior of the French right.\u000a\u000aThe conservatives, however, are in a mess. Les Républicains bosses are locked in a battle over how to carry on under Macron, with one camp \u2014 led by hard-liner Laurent Wauquiez \u2014 advocating open confrontation with the government, and another \u2014 led by former Finance Minister François Baroin \u2014 taking a more conciliatory line.\u000a\u000aDarmanin, who left the party five months ago, has had nothing to do with the jostling \u2014 and it\u2019s that kind of clever maneuvering that makes him a likely conservative leader down the line.\u000a\u000aThe 35-year-old, born to a working-class family with Algerian and Maltese roots, is in charge of carrying out budget cuts that conservatives will embrace, and is setting himself up as the standard-bearer for a new generation of conservatives who want nothing to do with the party\u2019s old guard \u2014 especially former Prime Minister François Fillon, who failed to win power when it was within his grasp.\u000a\u000aDarmanin is seen as being so cunning that conservatives have taken to calling him\u201dDar-malin\u201d \u2014 a play on the word for clever, although the origin of malin in French is \u201cevil.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s going to do the job for Macron but in four, five, 10 years \u2014 expect to hear a lot more about him,\u201d said an aide who asked not to be named.\u000a\u000a\u2018Judas\u2019\u000a\u000aA recent exchange in parliament captured some of Darmanin\u2019s chutzpah. He was making one of his first speeches in the chamber when far-right leader Marine Le Pen yelled \u201cJudas\u201d at him. He quickly fired back, \u201cUnlike you, Judas will go down in history.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe remark showed not just that Darmanin embraces being viewed as a turncoat, but that he harbors few doubts about his destiny. He told an interviewer from the Bondy Blog, a news site based near Paris: \u201cIf you question people close to me about my temperament, they will tell you I have doubts about nothing. It\u2019s not a matter of being pretentious, but I never consider whether what I undertake is going to succeed. The idea never enters my head.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarmanin is seen as being so cunning that conservatives have taken to calling him\u201dDar-malin\u201d \u2014 a play on the word for clever, although the origin of malin in French is \u201cevil.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe nickname is not meant as a compliment.\u000a\u000aGiven that many Les Républicains MPs consider Darmanin to be a traitor, he may seem an unlikely heir to Sarkozy\u2019s crown. But his current position is enviable, even ideal.\u000a\u000aWhile Les Républicains struggle to find their place in a French politics turned upside down by Macron, Darmanin \u2014 whose office did not respond to a request for comment for this article \u2014 is gaining important experience as a minister, including by slashing funds from bloated ministries, one of Fillon\u2019s core campaign proposals.\u000a\u000aAnd unlike the Macron government\u2019s other conservative \u201ctraitor,\u201d Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, Darmanin is young enough to claim that he had nothing to do with the privileged ruling elite.\u000a\u000aAlgerian roots\u000a\u000aDarmanin does not fit the profile of a traditional French conservative. He was born in the hardscrabble northern town of Valenciennes (current unemployment rate: 15.2 percent) to a father who managed a bistro and a mother who worked as a cleaner. One of his grandparents, he likes to remind anyone who will listen, was an Algerian who fought for France as a \u201cHarki\u201d soldier. Another was a Maltese Jew.\u000a\u000aDarmanin did badly at public school in Valenciennes, so his parents scraped together the cash for private education in Paris. When they ran out of money for tuition, the school allowed Darmanin to finish his studies for free (in exchange, he had to spend years working as a hall monitor).\u000a\u000aAfter working odd jobs that included singing in the metro and waiting tables, he signed up for the Lille branch of Sciences Po, the elite school of political science.\u000a\u000aFormer classmates remember him as uncommonly focused and driven from the first day.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we showed up to school, Gérald was standing by the door wearing a full suit and greeting people as they came in,\u201d remembered one classmate, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Ben. \u201cHe was already then who he is today.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother ex-classmate, who also asked not to be named, recalled how Darmanin passed up a chance to study for a year abroad in one of Sciences Po\u2019s sister institutions. Instead, he chose to work as an intern at the European Parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn my third year [at Sciences Po], I had no money and honestly no desire to go abroad,\u201d he told Bondy Blog. \u201cSo instead of thinking of student parties, I went looking for work at the European Parliament.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom there, the only way was up. Darmanin was taken under the wing of former Gaullist minister Jacques Toubon, who introduced him to conservative heavyweights such as Xavier Bertrand, who now runs Northern France\u2019s regional council, and helped him become chief of staff to Sarkozy\u2019s sports minister, David Douillet.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Darmanin ran for election as mayor of Tourcoing, just north of Lille, and won, establishing himself on the national political scene.\u000a\u000aSarkozy and Islam\u000a\u000aOne elder political statesman who could not get enough of Darmanin was Sarkozy. In this scrappy, determined child of immigrants, he saw a reflection of himself \u2014 another \u201clittle Frenchman of mixed blood,\u201d to borrow Sarko\u2019s own phrase.\u000a\u000aIt was a mark of Sarkozy\u2019s affection that he forgave Darmanin for criticizing his lurch toward right-wing politics during the 2012 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aDarmanin, whose middle name is Moussa, had bristled at the suggestion, made by Sarkozy and other conservatives, that Islam was \u201cincompatible with the French Republic.\u201d Darmanin told Bondy Blog that although he felt \u201cculturally Catholic,\u201d it was unfair to tell the offspring of Muslims who died fighting for the tricolor that their religion was incompatible with being French.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s changing camps is not a disappointment; it confirms what we knew of him\u201d \u2014 Brice Hortefeux\u000a\u000aPerhaps to square his own views on the issue, perhaps as a shrewd political move, Darmanin came up with a solution for France\u2019s struggle to integrate a large Muslim population. As Napoleon had done with France\u2019s Jews in 1808, Darmanin suggested the French state should sign an agreement with Muslim leaders stating that they would always respect the Republic\u2019s laws, conduct much of their teaching in French and rescind foreign influence.\u000a\u000aSarkozy liked the idea, and the man, so much so that he brought Darmanin onboard as director of his conservative primary election campaign in 2016.\u000a\u000aSarkozy failed to win the primary, and instead it was Fillon who became the conservative choice for president.\u000a\u000aAt first, Darmanin toed the line and joined in attacks on Fillon\u2019s main rival for the presidency at the time, a former economy minister named Emmanuel Macron just four years older than Darmanin.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe [Macron] is a pure product of the system,\u201d Darmanin wrote in January for newspaper l\u2019Opinion. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a better representative of the best neighborhoods, the best studies, the best wealth, the best network.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut as Fillon became embroiled in a scandal over public money paid to his wife and children, Darmanin performed an about-face. He resigned from a senior position in the Républicains hierarchy and withdrew from the election campaign, angering former allies. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s changing camps is not a disappointment; it confirms what we knew of him,\u201d said a former interior minister and Sarkozy ally, Brice Hortefeux.\u000a\u000aTwo months later, Darmanin was appointed a minister under Macron.\u000a\u000aJostling with Le Maire\u000a\u000aMacron bore no grudge against Darmanin over his criticism during the campaign. Instead, he put the then 34-year-old in charge of carrying out a crucial campaign pledge, to bring France\u2019s budget deficit below a European Commission target of 3 percent of gross domestic product by year-end.\u000a\u000aIf it sounds like nasty work, that\u2019s because it is.\u000a\u000aDarmanin, who has a reputation for personal thriftiness and kept strict control over spending when running Tourcoing, has become the face of budget cuts, shearing billions of euros from the coffers of various ministries and government bodies. That includes the military, whose former top officer Pierre de Villiers resigned in a huff after an increasingly bitter public feud with Macron over proposed budget cuts. The spat began when de Villiers read an interview with Darmanin in Le Parisien about the cuts.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019ll be dragged over coals in the months to come by civil servants furious at budget cuts. And that may be exactly what he wants, as a conservative eyeing his own reputation for future elections when he\u2019ll likely be courting conservative voters. The budget cuts also happen to be France\u2019s main domestic economic story this year, and Darmanin\u2019s in charge.\u000a\u000aAs a minister, he\u2019s displaying Sarkozy-like energy levels. When customs officers at a Paris airport seized a large illegal shipment of turtle shells, Darmanin \u2014 only nominally responsible for customs \u2014 raced to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot for the photo op, on what was otherwise a slow news day.\u000a\u000aSuch hyperactivity puts Darmanin on a collision course with the finance ministry\u2019s other big fish, Bruno Le Maire.\u000a\u000aAn aide to the economy minister told POLITICO the two men were \u201cvery complementary\u201d and traveled together to weekly cabinet meetings. But the aide added that Darmanin did not \u201chave Bruno\u2019s public profile \u2026 It\u2019s not an insult to him to say that he\u2019s young, and that he did not run for election during the primary.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Darmanin\u2019s fast-paced style, the aide said, \u201cHe learned politics under Sarkozy.\u201d

aVMark Zuckerberg has no plans to run for president, the Facebook founder and CEO told BuzzFeed News Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in response to a question asking if he had any plans to run for president. \u201cI'm focused on building our community at Facebook and working on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,\u201d referring to the limited-liability corporation he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, founded in 2015 to advance human potential and promote equality through major bets in education and science research. Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether he\u2019d explicitly ruled out a run.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg\u2019s response comes after weeks of speculation from the tech press and beyond, set off by a series of events that indicated a run might be in the cards, including a pledge to visit the approximately 30 US states he hadn\u2019t yet been to. \u201cWill Mark Zuckerberg Be Our Next President?\u201d Vanity Fair asked in January.\u000a\u000aThe clues were there. Zuckerberg, who had previously been described as an atheist, said over the holidays that he believes religion is important. He\u2019s touring the US asking \u201cfolks\u201d about how they live. He hired a former White House photographer to take his Facebook pics. He included a clause about potentially serving for office into Facebook\u2019s stock restructuring deal, and he hired a former presidential campaign manager to help his quasi-charitable works. But as Zuckerberg indicated Tuesday, he\u2019s more interested in wielding influence from Menlo Park than Washington, DC. A source close to Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed News the 32-year-old CEO has privately denied it as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no truth to the idea that Mark is running for office and I\u2019ve heard it directly from him,\u201d the source told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: For Mark, Facebook is global community that already plays this huge part in the lives of billions of people around the world and plays an incredibly important role in shaping the base on the issues that matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aZuckerberg is preparing for a political battle, the source was careful to emphasize, but as a private citizen focused on the goals he has already outlined through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cThere is absolutely a possibility that Mark may choose to play a stronger role in the political system and political debates,\u201d the source said. Zuckerberg has been \u201cvery transparent\u201d in his advocacy for \u201cgreater equality and optimizing research that find cures for disease and solves the fundamental problems of our time, but I really don\u2019t see him stepping away from Facebook.\u201d

aVWho could blame the people who felt abandoned and ignored by the major parties for reaching in despair for a candidate who offered oversimplified answers to infinitely complex questions and managed to entertain them in the process? With hindsight, it is clear that we all but ensured the rise of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aI will let the liberals answer for their own sins in this regard. (There are many.) But we conservatives mocked Barack Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure. It was we conservatives who, upon Obama\u2019s election, stated that our No. 1 priority was not advancing a conservative policy agenda but making Obama a one-term president\u2014the corollary to this binary thinking being that his failure would be our success and the fortunes of the citizenry would presumably be sorted out in the meantime. It was we conservatives who were largely silent when the most egregious and sustained attacks on Obama\u2019s legitimacy were leveled by marginal figures who would later be embraced and legitimized by far too many of us. It was we conservatives who rightly and robustly asserted our constitutional prerogatives as a co-equal branch of government when a Democrat was in the White House but who, despite solemn vows to do the same in the event of a Trump presidency, have maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued. To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical faculties. And tremendous powers of denial.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been sympathetic to this impulse to denial, as one doesn\u2019t ever want to believe that the government of the United States has been made dysfunctional at the highest levels, especially by the actions of one\u2019s own party. Michael Gerson, a con­servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, \u201cThe conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,\u201d and conservative institutions \u201cwith the blessings of a president \u2026 have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a conservative, that\u2019s an awfully bitter pill to swallow. So as I layered in my defense mechanisms, I even found myself saying things like, \u201cIf I took the time to respond to every presiden­tial tweet, there would be little time for anything else.\u201d Given the volume and velocity of tweets from both the Trump campaign and then the White House, this was certainly true. But it was also a monumental dodge. It would be like Noah saying, \u201cIf I spent all my time obsessing about the coming flood, there would be little time for anything else.\u201d At a certain point, if one is being honest, the flood becomes the thing that is most worthy of attention. At a certain point, it might be time to build an ark.\u000a\u000aUnder our Constitution, there simply are not that many people who are in a position to do something about an executive branch in chaos. As the first branch of government (Article I), the Congress was designed expressly to assert itself at just such moments. It is what we talk about when we talk about \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d Too often, we observe the unfolding drama along with the rest of the country, passively, all but saying, \u201cSomeone should do something!\u201d without seeming to realize that that someone is us. And so, that unnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch is an abdication, and those in positions of leadership bear particular responsibility.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

We do not have to go very far back to identify these exemplars\u2014the Bob Doles and Howard Bakers and Richard Lugars of the Senate. Vigorous partisans, yes, but even more important, principled constitutional conservatives whose primary interest was in governing and making America truly great.\u000a\u000aBut then the period of collapse and dysfunction set in, amplified by the internet and our growing sense of alienation from each other, and we lost our way and began to rationalize away our principles in the process. But where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals\u2014even as we put at risk our institutions and our values\u2014then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn\u2019t be Pyrrhic ones. If this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it. If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?\u000a\u000aIf this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it. If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the strange specter of an American president\u2019s seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians created such a cognitive dissonance among my generation of conservatives\u2014who had come of age under existential threat from the Soviet Union\u2014that it was almost impossible to believe. Even as our own government was documenting a con­certed attack against our democratic processes by an enemy foreign power, our own White House was rejecting the authority of its own intelligence agencies, disclaiming their findings as a Democratic ruse and a hoax. Conduct that would have had conservatives up in arms had it been exhibited by our political opponents now had us dumbstruck.\u000a\u000aIt was then that I was compelled back to Senator Goldwater\u2019s book, to a chapter entitled \u201cThe Soviet Menace.\u201d Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, this part of Goldwater\u2019s critique had seemed particularly anachronistic. The lesson here is that nothing is gone forever, especially when it comes to the devouring ambition of despotic men. As Goldwater wrote in that chapter:\u000a\u000aOur forebears knew that \u201ckeeping a Republic\u201d meant, above all, keeping it safe from foreign transgressors; they knew that a people cannot live and work freely, and develop national institutions conducive to freedom, except in peace and with independence.\u000a\u000aSo, where should Republicans go from here? First, we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to speak out if the president \u201cplays to the base\u201d in ways that damage the Republican Party\u2019s ability to grow and speak to a larger audience. Second, Republicans need to take the long view when it comes to issues like free trade: Populist and protectionist policies might play well in the short term, but they handicap the country in the long term. Third, Republicans need to stand up for institutions and prerogatives, like the Senate filibuster, that have served us well for more than two centuries.\u000a\u000aWe have taken our \u201cinstitutions conducive to freedom,\u201d as Goldwater put it, for granted as we have engaged in one of the more reckless periods of politics in our history.

The carmaker received an advance copy of the speech, removing \u201cproblematic sections\u201d and adding \u201cpositive formulations,\u201d Bild am Sonntag reported.\u000a\u000aWeil and the Social Democrats (SPD) vehemently rejected accusations of wrongdoing, saying his consultations with the carmaker were innocuous and had long been known.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis purportedly new trouble is old news and was already discussed in Lower Saxony over a year ago. It\u2019s election maneuvering,\u201d Weil told the paper.\u000a\u000aWeil argued that the emissions scandal required him to weigh his words carefully to avoid unduly causing massive losses at Volkswagen. On Sunday, his regional government published a draft of the 2015 speech in an attempt to show that the state premier merely sought legal and technical advice from the carmaker.\u000a\u000aThe draft appears to show that stern criticisms of VW\u2019s behavior were not removed from the text after it was sent to the carmaker. However, a sentence on the legal implications of Volkswagen\u2019s behavior was amended at the company\u2019s behest.\u000a\u000aThe VW spat comes hot on the heels of yet more trouble for Weil and the SPD. On Friday, Green MP Elke Twesten switched her allegiance to the Christian Democrats, meaning the SPD-Green governing coalition lost its one-seat majority.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a hastily convened press conference after Twesten\u2019s announcement Friday, Weil said he supported calling a new election, but ruled out stepping down. A snap election is scheduled for October 15.\u000a\u000aOther SPD leaders raised questions about whether the conservatives had made secret promises to buy the Green lawmaker\u2019s allegiance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a clumsy attempt at discrediting Stephan Weil\u2019s successful government and to distract from the machinations of the CDU,\u201d said the SPD\u2019s vice chairman, Ralf Stegner.\u000a\u000aFellow Social Democrat Thomas Oppermann, head of the party in the national parliament, added: \u201cI want to know if there was more, or if further promises were made by the CDU in Lower Saxony.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

If Britain leaves the EU, then France and Germany will carry even greater weight, and the eurozone, along with its Nordic neighbors, will be in a strong position to press forward with deeper integration.\u000a\u000aCrucial trio\u000a\u000aA graduate of the elite Polytechnique University, the Toulouse native is taking over as permanent representative after a string of high-level posts including deputy permanent representative to the EU and European affairs sherpa to the president until 2017.\u000a\u000aAt the permanent representation, Léglise-Costa will be in constant contact with Macron\u2019s inner circle, notably his diplomatic adviser, Philippe Etienne, and his EU and G20 adviser, Clément Beaune.\u000a\u000aLéglise-Costa and Etienne have a decades-long working relationship, and he and Beaune were in close contact when the latter was advising Macron on EU affairs at the finance ministry.\u000a\u000aIn close coordination with Macron, the three men will be in charge of fine-tuning French day-to-day policy on the European stage, with Etienne taking a special interest in Germany and Beaune well-versed in trade and anti-dumping issues.\u000a\u000aThe new ambassador is known for his mastery of EU affairs and mechanics. He will have to prove during his first few months that he can embrace the role\u2019s more political and outward-facing aspects, at which his predecessor Sellal excelled.\u000a\u000aAt the European Affairs Directorate of the prime minister\u2019s office, Léglise-Costa is likely to be succeeded by Alexis Dutertre, who was deputy permanent representative before returning to France this year.\u000a\u000aThe nominations, three months into Macron\u2019s presidency, are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. They come amid intensive maneuvering for coveted diplomatic jobs across the French network.\u000a\u000aAmbassador to the United States Gérard Araud is expected to remain in his post, while China envoy Maurice Gourdault-Montagne took over as secretary-general of the foreign ministry.\u000a\u000aAnne-Marie Descôtes took over from Etienne as French ambassador to Berlin.

aVAn Iranian woman looks at cartoons of U.S. President Donald Trump at an exhibition of the 2017 International Trumpism Cartoon and Caricature contest in Tehran, Iran | Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images Opinion How Trump\u2019s Iran threats could backfire \u2014 in North Korea Walking away from the deal with Tehran could leave us with a nuclear crisis on two fronts.\u000a\u000aIf, as he has clearly signaled, President Donald Trump chooses in the coming months to hold Iran in noncompliance of the nuclear accord, the impact will be felt in Tehran and the already volatile Middle East.\u000a\u000aBut the more serious casualty could be both more widespread and more distant\u2014thousands of miles away, on the Korean Peninsula. And the Trump administration needs to begin connecting the dots now.\u000a\u000aThe United States has few options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear challenge, and no good ones. A pre-emptive strike risks an unspeakable catastrophe. Sanctions have not worked, and tightening them further is no more likely to. Diplomatic talks will be difficult for the United States because an agreement would involve a compromise that would allow North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, if the goal is to prevent Pyongyang from developing an accurate nuclear-tipped ICBM, then negotiating with Pyongyang may well be the only way to try to defuse a looming crisis.\u000a\u000aEven under current conditions, such talks would be fraught, the odds tilted against success. But if the U.S. thrusts aside the nuclear deal with Iran\u2014and uses contrived evidence to do so\u2014the message to North Korea and others will be that America\u2019s word is disposable and the U.S. cannot be trusted to honor its commitments. This would deal a possibly fatal blow to any chance of a diplomatic effort to, if not halt or reverse, at a minimum slow down North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u000a\u000aIf anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aIndeed, walking away from the Iran deal, or contriving circumstances that force Iran to do so, would not only open up a now dormant nuclear crisis with Tehran, it would also close down perhaps the only option that might prevent a far more dangerous crisis with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea already harbors heightened suspicion and mistrust of Washington\u2019s motives, fearing that the U.S.\u2019 real objective is removal of the Kim regime and reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korean leadership. U.S. abandonment, without just cause, of the Iran deal would both validate and exacerbate those beliefs; to Pyongyang, the lesson would be that Washington saw diplomacy merely as a prelude to efforts to isolate, pressure and seek to remove the Iranian regime. Why would Kim Jong Un even begin negotiations if he is convinced that Washington would then look for excuses to unravel an agreement, should one be reached?\u000a\u000aThe message from Washington, of course, would not be heard in Pyongyang alone. The administration\u2019s too-clever-by-half strategy of messing around with the Iranian nuclear accord\u2014doing just enough to tempt Tehran to walk away from the deal after Trump publicly acknowledged that his goal is to undo it\u2014almost certainly would undermine its credibility with nations whose cooperation it desperately needs to deal with the North Korean nuclear challenge. The recent unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea demonstrates two things: first, that a unilateral U.S. approach is impracticable; and second, that China and Russia can be useful partners in pressing Pyongyang on its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. If anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aBut consider China\u2019s reaction should the U.S. treat the nuclear agreement with Iran in a slapdash, dismissive manner. Beijing might well be angered given its interests in buying Iran\u2019s oil and investing in its infrastructure. But it would be positively alarmed at the implications for North Korea, which presents China with a major security headache on its doorstep. China long has maintained that diplomacy with Pyongyang is the only viable answer to the North Korean nuclear problem, and it believes in the six-party format, which, not entirely unlike the seven-party format of the Iran negotiations, includes both China and the U.S. The precedent of the U.S. effectively dismissing an accord negotiated by a team of countries and ratified by the U.N. Security Council would give China considerable pause, raise serious questions in its mind about whether the U.S. can be trusted not to act similarly with North Korea, and make it virtually impossible for Beijing to vouch for Washington\u2019s good faith vis-à-vis Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility.\u000a\u000aAllies also might lose faith. Throughout the long-simmering nuclear crisis with North Korea, the Bush and Obama administrations managed to preserve solidarity with South Korea and Japan. Going forward, any sustainable solution to this crisis will require implementation of a joint U.S.-South Korea strategy backed by Japan. Moon Jae-In, South Korea\u2019s newly elected president, is a strong proponent of engagement with the North, and both Seoul and Tokyo are desperate to contain the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. It\u2019s hardly an exaggeration to suggest that both would be apoplectic if, by repudiating the nuclear accord with Iran, the U.S. effectively cut off the path to a diplomatic solution on the peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently offered the welcome suggestion that the U.S. is open to diplomacy and reassurance to Pyongyang that the U.S. is not intent on regime change. Surely, both he and others in the administration\u2014Generals James Mattis, H.R. McMaster and John Kelly in particular, all of whom reportedly lobbied for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear accord the last time around\u2014understand how hollow those words will ring if, the next time certification is in play, they fail to persuade the president. The least one can hope is that they will see the linkage, because it\u2019s a pretty good bet that this president won\u2019t. And it\u2019s just as good a bet that, by failing to peek just around the corner, he would be creating the prospect of a two-front nuclear crisis that America and the world can ill afford.\u000a\u000aAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aRichard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

aVAfter the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, the CIA appeared eager, even desperate, to embrace the version of events being offered by the FBI, the Secret Service and other parts of the government. The official story: that a delusional misfit and self-proclaimed Marxist named Lee Harvey Oswald killed the president in Dallas with his $21 mail-order rifle and there was no evidence of a conspiracy, foreign or domestic. Certainly, the CIA\u2019s leaders told the Warren Commission, the independent panel that investigated the murder, there was no evidence of a conspiracy that the spy agency could have foiled.\u000a\u000aBut thousands of pages of long-secret, assassination-related documents released by the National Archives last week show that, within a few years of Kennedy\u2019s murder, some in the CIA began to worry internally that the official story was wrong\u2014an alarm the agency never sounded publicly.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSpecifically, key CIA officials were concerned by the mid-1970s that the agency, the FBI, the Secret Service and the White House commission led by Chief Justice Earl Warren had never followed up on important clues about Oswald\u2019s contact with foreign agents, including diplomats and spies for the Communist governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union, who might have been aware of his plans to kill Kennedy and even encouraged the plot. (There is no credible evidence cited in the documents released so far that Cuban leader Fidel Castro or other foreign leaders had any personal role in ordering Kennedy\u2019s murder.)\u000a\u000aThe CIA documents also offer tantalizing speculation about the chain of events in late 1963 that explained Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy, which have previously never been established with certainty\u2014how he may have become enraged after reading a detailed article in his hometown newspaper in New Orleans in September suggesting that his hero Castro had been targeted for assassination by the Kennedy administration. According to that theory, Oswald, who had rifle training in the Marine Corps, then set out to seek vengeance on Castro\u2019s behalf\u2014to kill Kennedy before the American president managed to kill the Cuban leader.\u000a\u000aIf that proved true, it would have raised a terrible question for the CIA: Was it possible that JFK\u2019s assassination was, directly or indirectly, blowback for the spy agency\u2019s plots to kill Castro? It would eventually be acknowledged the CIA had, in fact, repeatedly tried to assassinate Castro, sometimes in collusion with the Mafia, throughout Kennedy\u2019s presidency. The CIA\u2019s arsenal of weapons against Castro included a fungus-infected scuba suit, a poison-filled hypodermic needle hidden in a pen\u2014and even an exploding cigar. The Warren Commission, never told about the CIA\u2019s Castro plots, mostly ducked the question of Oswald\u2019s motives, other than saying in its final report that he had expressed a \u201chatred for American society.\u201d\u000a\u000aJFK historians and the nation\u2019s large army of private assassination researchers are still scrambling to make sense of the latest batch of tens of thousands of pages of previously secret CIA and FBI documents that were unsealed last week by the National Archives. The documents\u2014441 files that had previously been withheld entirely, along with 3,369 other documents that had been previously released only in part\u2014were made public under terms of a 1992 law that requires the unsealing of all JFK assassination-related documents by October, the law\u2019s 25-year deadline.\u000a\u000aSince the release last week, researchers do not appear to have identified any single document that could be labeled a bombshell or that rewrites the history of the assassination in any significant way. Many of the documents, which were made public only online, are duplicates of files that had been released years earlier. Other documents are totally illegible or refer to CIA and FBI code names and pseudonyms that even experienced researchers will take months to decipher. Several documents are written in foreign languages.\u000a\u000aStill, the newly released documents may offer an intriguing glimpse of what comes next. The National Archives is required to unseal a final batch of about 3,100 never-before-seen JFK-assassination files by the October deadline, assuming the move is not blocked by President Donald Trump. Under the 1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, the president is the only person empowered to stop the release. (Congressional and other government officials have told us in confidence that at least two federal agencies\u2014likely the CIA and FBI\u2014are expected to appeal to Trump to block the unsealing of at least some of the documents. Even after 54 years, some government officials apparently still want to keep secrets about this seminal event in U.S. history. The CIA and FBI acknowledged earlier this year they are conducting a final review of the documents, but have been unwilling to say if they will ask the president to block some from being released.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aNone of the files released last week undermines the Warren Commission\u2019s finding that Oswald killed Kennedy with shots fired from his perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza\u2014a conclusion supported by 21st century forensic analysis\u2014and that there was no credible evidence of a second gunman.\u000a\u000aBut the new documents do revive the question of why the CIA, so skeptical internally of many of the commission\u2019s other findings by the 1970s, never acknowledged those suspicions to later government investigators\u2014or to the public. Documents released decades ago show that CIA and FBI officials repeatedly misled\u2014and often lied outright\u2014to Chief Justice Warren and his commission, probably to hide evidence of the agencies\u2019 bungling in their surveillance of Oswald before the president\u2019s murder. The CIA appears also to have been determined to block the commission from stumbling on to evidence that might reveal the agency\u2019s assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders.\u000a\u000aNew Window The CIA historian's report from 2013 that refers to the "benign coverup." (Click to view full document.)\u000a\u000aNew Window The 1964 letter.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the CIA\u2019s in-house historian concluded that the spy agency had conducted a \u201cbenign cover-up\u201d during the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation in 1963 and 1964 in hopes of keeping the commission focused on \u201cwhat the Agency believed was the \u2018best truth\u2019 \u2014 that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.\u201d\u000a\u000aNew Window Labeled \u201cSECRET\u201d and stamped \u201cREPRODUCTION PROHIBITED\u201d on each page, this 1975 memo lists several important clues about Oswald that went unexplored in the months and years after Kennedy\u2019s death. (Click to open full document)\u000a\u000aBut what if the \u201cbest truth\u201d was wrong? According to documents made public last week, the CIA was alarmed by the mid-1970s to realize that no one had properly followed up on clues about an especially mysterious chapter in Oswald\u2019s life\u2014a six-day, apparently self-financed trip to Mexico City beginning in late September 1963, two months before the assassination. The reason for the trip has never been determined with certainty, although he told his wife, Marina, that he went there to obtain a visa that would allow him to defect to Cuba, much as he had once attempted to defect to the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aThe CIA acknowledged long ago that the agency\u2019s Mexico City station had Oswald under surveillance during the trip, and that he met there with Cuban and Soviet diplomats and spies. The CIA station chief said later he was convinced that Oswald had a brief sexual relationship with a Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate. Although there is no credible evidence of Soviet involvement in the assassination, Oswald\u2019s other contacts in Mexico included\u2014shockingly enough\u2014a KGB assassinations expert who doubled as an accredited Soviet diplomat. A top-secret June 1964 FBI report, made public in the 1990s but apparently never seen by key investigators for the Warren Commission, suggests that Oswald was overheard threatening to kill Kennedy during his visits to the Cuban diplomatic compound in Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe files released last week also show that the CIA and other agencies failed to pursue clues that Oswald, who publicly championed Castro\u2019s revolution even while serving in the Marine Corps, had been in contact with Cuban diplomats years before the Mexico trip\u2014possibly as early as 1959, when he was deployed to a military base in Southern California. The information initially came to the FBI and the Warren Commission from a fellow Marine who recalled how Oswald boasted about his contacts with Cuban diplomats in Los Angeles, where Castro\u2019s government then had an office.\u000a\u000aThe account from the fellow Marine was of \u201ca lot more possible operational significance\u201d than was realized in the months after the assassination but was never \u201crun down or developed by investigation,\u201d according to a 1975 CIA internal memo released last week. \u201cThe record of the beginning of OSWALD\u2019s relationship with the Cubans starts with a question mark.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat 27-page memo, which does not identify its author, is among the most intriguing of the documents in last week\u2019s batch unsealed by the National Archives. Copies of the document were found inside larger CIA files released last week, including thick agency files labeled HELMS HEARING DUPLICATE. That seems to suggest the memo was given to former Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms, who led the agency from 1966 to 1973, when he was later summoned to testify secretly to Congress about his involvement in the CIA assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders. Similar documents about the Kennedy assassination and Oswald were written in the 1970s by a senior CIA counterintelligence official, Raymond Rocca, who had served as the agency\u2019s chief liaison to the Warren Commission.\u000a\u000aLabeled \u201cSECRET\u201d and stamped \u201cREPRODUCTION PROHIBITED\u201d on each page, the 1975 memo lists several important clues about Oswald that went unexplored in the months and years after Kennedy\u2019s death. (Versions of the same CIA memo were part of the flood of millions of pages of documents released after the 1992 law, although it has never attracted detailed attention outside a small circle of assassination researchers. Brian Latell, a respected former CIA analyst on Cuban intelligence, cited a version of the document in his 2012 book Castro\u2019s Secrets, which suggested much closer links between Oswald and Cuba than had previously been known.)\u000a\u000aThe 1975 document noted the failure of the CIA, FBI and the Warren Commission to interview a key witness in Mexico City\u2014Silvia Duran, the Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate and was reported to have had the affair with Oswald. She is the \u201csole live witness on the record regarding Oswald\u2019s activities,\u201d yet her testimony \u201cwas taken and presented, solely, by the Mexican governmental authorities,\u201d the CIA memo said. Duran, who is still alive, has repeatedly insisted she had no sexual relationship with Oswald, although she readily acknowledges that she helped him with his unsuccessful visa application for Cuba.\u000a\u000aIt was that same CIA memo that offered a detailed theory of the chain of events that led Oswald to kill Kennedy\u2014how Oswald, who lived in his hometown of New Orleans for much of 1963, may have been inspired to assassinate the president if, as seemed probable, he read an article on Monday, September 9, in the local newspaper, that suggested Castro was targeted for murder by the United States.\u000a\u000aThe article, written by a reporter for The Associated Press in Havana and then published prominently in the Times-Picayune, was an account of an AP interview with Castro two days earlier, in which the Cuban strongman angrily warned the Kennedy administration that he was aware of U.S. assassination plots aimed at Cuban leaders, presumably including him, and was prepared to retaliate. The article quoted Castro as saying: \u201cU.S. leaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to do away with leaders of Cuba.\u201d\u000a\u000aNew Window The September 1963 Times Picayune story. (Click to view full-size image.)\u000a\u000aThe CIA memo suggested that if Oswald, who was known to be an \u201cavid reader\u201d of the Times-Picayune, saw the article, it might have put the idea in his head to kill Kennedy as retaliation for the threat the United States posed to Castro\u2014an idea that would have been in his mind as he left for his trip to Mexico that month. The possibility that Oswald read the article \u201cmust be considered of great significance in light of the pathological evolution of Oswald\u2019s passive/aggressive makeup\u201d and \u201chis identification with Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution,\u201d the CIA memo said.\u000a\u000aImmediately after the assassination, the CIA\u2019s Mexico City station warned CIA headquarters that the AP article might contain a vital clue about Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy\u2014and even about possible Cuban involvement. But according to the 1975 analysis, \u201cThere is no evidence in the files on the Kennedy assassination that the Castro interview was considered in following up leads or in dealing with the Warren Commission, although Mexico Station specifically directed headquarters to the AP story very shortly after the Dallas killing.\u201d\u000a\u000aPreviously released internal documents from the Warren Commission show that one of the commission\u2019s most aggressive staff lawyers believed that Castro\u2019s remarks to the AP\u2014and the possibility that Oswald read the article\u2014might be of great significance in explaining Oswald\u2019s motives. But the internal files show that more senior staff members decided against any reference to the AP article in the commission\u2019s final report for fear of feeding conspiracy theories about a possible Cuban link to Kennedy\u2019s death. It does not reflect well on the legacy of either the CIA or the commission that, half a century after those gunshots rang out in Dealey Plaza, the newly released documents suggest that at least some of those conspiracy theories might be true.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPhilip Shenon, a former Washington and foreign correspondent for the New York Times, is the author of A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination.\u000a\u000aLarry J.

aVFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Scaramucci: Vulgar rant was mostly \u2018humorous and joking\u2019 Trump\u2019s short-lived communications chief was fired after an astonishing interview.\u000a\u000aFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said Tuesday that his vulgar and expletive-laden remarks about his Trump administration colleagues were intended as \u201chumorous and joking\u201d comments between friends, not as an on-the-record conversation with a reporter.\u000a\u000aIn a bombshell interview with the New Yorker published last week, Scaramucci used an expletive in referring to then-White House chief of staff a \u201cparanoid schizophrenic.\u201d In that same interview, Scaramucci accused White House chief strategist Steve Bannon of acting in his own self-interest, describing Bannon\u2019s actions with a crude sexual metaphor.\u000a\u000aScaramucci, who was removed from his position as communications director on Monday after less than two weeks on the job, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that he believed his conversation with New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza would stay between them.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cMost of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.\u201d\u000a\u000aLizza disputed Scaramucci\u2019s assertion that the two men are friends, although he conceded that their fathers may have known one another. And Lizza\u2019s publication, in a statement first reported by Axios, noted that Scaramucci had requested during the conversation that certain portions be put off the record and that the magazine respected those requests, a seeming indication that the communications director understood the nature of his conversation with Lizza.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been \u2018old family friends,\u2019 though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.),\u201d Lizza wrote in an emailed comment to The Huffington Post. \u201cBut again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.\u201d\u000a\u000aScaramucci said his conversation on Monday with newly-installed White House chief of staff John Kelly in which Kelly asked for his resignation was \u201cvery polite.\u201d He said he also spoke by telephone later that day with President Donald Trump as well as the president\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship,\u201d Scaramucci said.

aVPAPA AIR BASE, Hungary \u2014 Hold that convoy right there, general. Can we see your passport, please?\u000a\u000aEuropean leaders have made a priority of greater military cooperation, yet the ability of NATO forces to operate in Europe is still hindered by border restrictions and mismatched infrastructure, according to uniformed commanders and EU defense ministers.\u000a\u000aWhile NATO has made substantial progress in surmounting legal hurdles to cross-border operations, lingering bureaucratic requirements \u2014 such as passport checks at some border crossings and infrastructure problems, like roads and bridges that can\u2019t accommodate large military vehicles \u2014 could slow or even cripple any allied response to an emerging threat, officials warned.\u000a\u000aTo lift the roadblocks, and speed coordinated military action, the Dutch defense minister, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, called on EU officials to create a so-called military Schengen zone. The idea, loosely modeled on the open-border travel zone that has covered most of Europe since 1996, has also been a long-time goal of the senior United States Army commander in Europe, Lieutenant General Ben Hodges.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must be able to move quickly to any place where there is a threat\u201d \u2014 Dutch Defense Minister Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must be able to move quickly to any place where there is a threat,\u201d Hennis-Plasschaert said in a statement announcing her proposal at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in June.\u000a\u000aNATO leaders insist they have addressed the most problematic obstacles to cross-border operations, but nonetheless welcomed the Dutch proposal as a way to raise political pressure and create a sense of urgency around further improving the \u201cinteroperability\u201d of allied countries.\u000a\u000aOfficials say the obstacles are only apparent during peacetime exercises and planning, and that during a real military emergency, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander for Europe \u2014 based in Mons, Belgium \u2014 would simply warn allies and deploy as needed.\u000a\u000aBut officials also said NATO\u2019s deterrence mission requires the alliance to constantly demonstrate its capabilities in peacetime and those capabilities are still encumbered. Moving U.S. forces to Poland from Germany, for example, requires a five-day notice period, American officials said.\u000a\u000aAnd then there are infrastructure challenges: roads and bridges that potentially cannot bear the weight of heavy equipment; tunnels that are not tall enough; air strips that cannot accommodate all aircraft.\u000a\u000aWin-win\u000a\u000aEU leaders at their June summit formally approved a plan for greater military cooperation but the first concrete proposals will not be announced until European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s State of the Union speech in September.\u000a\u000aAccording to some officials, the military Schengen zone would be an ideal first step because there is little financial cost or basis for political disagreement.\u000a\u000aOne historic challenge is that while NATO has greater responsibility for multilateral military cooperation, the EU and its national governments retain authority over border regulations.\u000a\u000aHennis-Plasschaert, in putting forward her proposal, urged NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to work together to overcome such barriers.\u000a\u000aA NATO official said that the alliance supported the Dutch proposal, especially if it prompted the EU to take similar steps.\u000a\u000a\u201cOverall, we are in a healthy position in terms of rapid deployment in peacetime,\u201d the official said. \u201cEfforts in the European Union to improve the cross-border movement of forces and equipment in Europe could also benefit NATO, provided that they are inclusive and complementary to NATO\u2019s work.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Dutch proposal called on EU and NATO officials to work out the details, but it\u2019s clear that copying Schengen in a literal sense is not the goal, given that not all EU countries are NATO members and not all Schengen countries belong to the EU or the alliance.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is important to coordinate military transport in Europe, to ensure that units and equipment are in the right place at the right time, regardless of whether they are deployed in an EU or NATO context,\u201d Hennis-Plasschaert said.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the European Defense Agency, which helps coordinate military cooperation among EU countries, said a new joint effort with the European Commission to smooth military transport was expected to begin next month.\u000a\u000aWaiting for takeoff\u000a\u000aHodges, a three-star general who is due to complete his tour in September, knows the limitations on military movement firsthand.\u000a\u000aLast month, he sat in his jet on the tarmac of Papa Air base in Hungary, engines screaming in the 40-degree heat, as an aide collected the passports of the general and his entourage, including a German military attaché and this reporter, and brought them to be checked by Hungarian border guards waiting in a nearby car, so that the entourage could fly on to a base in Bulgaria.\u000a\u000a\u201cActually, I wish that we could move across Europe as quickly as migrants do\u201d \u2014 United States Army commander in Europe Lieutenant General Ben Hodges\u000a\u000aElsewhere on the base, 452 U.S.-led paratroopers were readying their gear to simulate an airborne operation aimed at repelling an enemy force that had occupied the territory of a NATO ally. Hours later, Hodges watched through binoculars as the paratroopers carried out their drill in Bulgaria.\u000a\u000aAt another point, during related exercises, Hodges was told that his Black Hawk helicopter would have to divert from its intended route in order to clear customs in Romania. Ultimately, Hodges was able to avoid the stop.\u000a\u000aWhile such passport and customs checks are typically routine and not hugely time-consuming, for Hodges they symbolize a tangle of bureaucracy that poses a risk to military speed and efficiency. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has put up fences to block the flow of migrants, but Hodges said that across much of Europe travel is easier for migrants than for allied military.\u000a\u000a\u201cActually, I wish that we could move across Europe as quickly as migrants do,\u201d Hodges said.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course, we should have to meet all the EU road laws, respect sovereignty, but it is a surprisingly cumbersome process in several countries to get permissions to move troops, weapons, ammunition, even just regular convoys,\u201d Hodges said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was naïve,\u201d the general said, \u201cI just assumed, well, these are all EU countries, or NATO countries, it should be like going from Florida to Virginia on I-95. And it\u2019s absolutely not the case. So there\u2019s just a variety of reasons in terms of diplomatic clearances, regulatory procedures, infrastructure.\u201d\u000a\u000aHodges said that investments in military transport and infrastructure also provide a convenient way for NATO allies such as Germany to meet their pledge to increase defense spending in ways that would indisputably benefit the alliance as a whole.

aVDanielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for The New York Times, said "Fox & Friends" did not attempt to "confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment." New York Times requests apology from Fox on ISIS story\u000a\u000aThe New York Times on Sunday took the unusual step of requesting an apology from a competitor, asking "Fox & Friends" to retract a report that the Times was to blame for the 2015 escape of an ISIS leader. Fox subsequently updated the story on its website with the NYT letter.\u000a\u000a"I am writing on behalf of The New York Times to request an on-air apology and tweet from Fox & Friends in regards to a malicious and inaccurate segment 'NY Times leak allowed ISIS leader to slip away,'\u201d wrote Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for the Times.\u000a\u000aThe "Fox & Friends" report, which aired Saturday, apparently spurred a tweet by President Donald Trump: \u201cThe Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, al-Baghdadi,\u201d the president wrote later Saturday. \u201cTheir sick agenda over National Security.\u201d The "Fox & Friends" hosts had said the Times was "failing in its credibility. It\u2019s failing our country."\u000a\u000aIn her request, Rhoades Ha added: "Neither the staff at Fox & Friends, nor the writers of a related story on Foxnews.com, appeared to make any attempt to confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment."\u000a\u000aLater Sunday, Fox attached the New York Times letter to its original story and issued this statement: "The FoxNews.com story was already updated online and Fox & Friends will also provide an updated story to viewers tomorrow morning based on the FoxNews.com report.

Tony Thomas, who told Fox that the published report caused a lead to the ISIS leader's whereabouts to go dry. "That was a very good lead. Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,\u201d said Thomas, who leads the U.S. Special Operations Command.\u000a\u000aA Fox News spokesperson said "There is absolutely no comparison between Herridge's brief report on Fox News Sunday" and the Times "reported much more compromising details than Herridge did, in revealing revealing specific details about how Baghdadi communicated and who played a role delivering those communications. Also, [the Times] reported the terrorist's wife was cooperating and how an informant led to the target."\u000a\u000aThe Times claims the pertinent material was actually disclosed by Carter in his public statement and stated that the Pentagon did not object to its more detailed June article.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on background, a Fox News executive slammed Rhoades Ha for seeking the apology only on Sunday afternoon and for alerting reporters at the same time.\u000a\u000a"NYT PR VP Danielle Rhoades Ha did not contact Fox News until Sunday afternoon \u2014 a day and a half AFTER the FoxNews.com story was published. She sent a letter to the reporter on the story \u2014 Catherine Herridge \u2014 at 3:30 pm on Sunday while being too cute by half and sending it to the press simultaneously \u2014 likely bcc\u2019ing reporters," the executive said. (The Times directly emailed POLITICO a copy of the letter that was sent to the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer on Sunday at 3:33 p.m.) "Herridge interviewed General Thomas at the Aspen Security Forum on Friday and did a wrap-up story on the panel for FoxNews.com, which was published on Friday night. Seems like an awfully long time to wait to correct something if they were so concerned about accuracy. And Ha did not reach out to Fox & Friends until 2 p.m. on Sunday for a story that aired Saturday morning. ... Why did it take them so long to reach out?"\u000a\u000aThe executive added: "If we notified the press every time the N.Y. Times had to update an online story or correct something, your inbox would crash."\u000a\u000aIn response, Rhoades Ha said she initially emailed the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer at 12:53 on Sunday, asking for a response by 3 p.m. Rhoades Ha also said she "sent a separate request to Catherine Herridge and her co-author to update their story, which I would have done with or without the Fox & Friends segment. I did not ask Catherine for an apology. She responded and updated her story."\u000a\u000aRhoades Ha said she has yet to receive a response from the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer.\u000a\u000a"We asked them for an apology because the entire premise of their segment is false," Rhoades Ha said. "I find it curious they are focusing on the timing of my emails instead of whether or not their reporting if false."\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, the Times sought clarification from the White House after Trump's tweet:\u000a\u000a"We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet. If the President is referring to this 2015 story, the Pentagon raised no objections with the Times before publishing the story in 2015 and no senior American official ever complained publicly about it until now, as noted in Peter Baker's story this morning."\u000a\u000aUPDATE July 24, 2017:\u000a\u000a\u201cFox & Friends\u201d addressed the Times\u2019 concerns in a segment Monday morning but did not apologize, saying, \u201cThe Times described its 2015 reporting to the Pentagon before publication and they had no objections, and no senior American officials have ever complained publicly \u2013 until now.\u201d The show then directed viewers to read the full statement online.\u000a\u000aIn response, The Times said the updated segment "wasn't an apology, nor did it begin to address the larger issues with the Fox & Friends Weekend segment, one of which was sheer hypocrisy. The host railed against The New York Times for covering a raid stating that the U.S. government 'would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked' to The New York Times when Fox News had covered the same raid three weeks earlier in a segment in which their correspondent said, 'The newly recovered intelligence may bring U.S. closer to Baghdadi's kill or capture,'" a Times spokesperson said. "According to the curious logic of the Fox & Friends host, Fox News itself was unpatriotic."\u000a\u000aIn an updated statement on Monday afternoon, Fox said that "Neither Fox News\u2019 report nor the subsequent on-air coverage was inaccurate." The network then links to a recent piece the Times wrote, explaining why it decided to name a CIA operative in one of its recent stories as something the Times is trying to distract people from by seeking an apology from Fox. "We find it beyond disappointing that the New York Times, in an attempt to distract from their recent debacle, decided to blame Fox News for comments made publicly by General Thomas during a widely viewed panel at the Aspen Security Forum. It might behoove the Times to actually check in with their reporter Eric Schmitt to see whether Gen. Thomas\u2019 comments have merit and whether Schmitt\u2019s reporting in 2015 revealed intelligence that allowed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to slip away.\u201d

aVAUSTIN, Tex., June 23\u2014 It was a tale of Texan proportions, complete with epic name-calling, massive lobbying and political skulduggery. It was Ross Perot's foray into the turbulent world of education reform -- and it offers a rare chance to examine how he operates in a political arena.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot proved he could learn quickly, sell bold policies to the public and ram them through a reluctant Legislature. But he also showed a taste for attention-grabbing invective that alienated some of the very people whose help he needed to change the state's education system.\u000a\u000aIn 1984, Texas adopted one of the most sweeping education laws in its history, paid for by its first state tax increase in 13 years. Although he must share credit with top state officials, it was Mr. Perot who led the charge. It was he who barnstormed the state in his own jet convening public hearings on Texas's schools. It was his biting one-liners that sold many Texans on the changes. It was his money that paid for one of the biggest lobbying efforts this state capital had ever witnessed. Measure of Leadership\u000a\u000aMr. Perot touts the $2.8 billion education package as proof that business methods, plain speaking and listening to people are indeed what it takes to forge policies, make changes and lead a nation. The law established a state preschool program for children with disadvantages, shifted school aid from rich to poor districts, reduced class sizes in early grades, toughened academic standards, mandated testing for teachers and raised teachers' salaries but linked raises to performance. And in a state where football reigned supreme, the law required students to pass all their courses or give up extracurricular activities like team sports.\u000a\u000aTo shake up education in Texas, Mr. Perot used the very methods he says he would apply as President to all national policies: Convene experts; hold extensive public meetings; decide on a policy; and beat back every attempt to compromise it.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot did not answer messages left at his headquarters requesting comment on his role in the education law.\u000a\u000aIt is clear that for all Mr. Perot's protestations about the evils of political action committees and political insiders, he knew how to leverage his considerable influence and money to railroad opponents.\u000a\u000a"It was like being in a sword fight with a pocket knife," said Eddie Joseph, executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. The coaches fought Mr. Perot bitterly on the law, along with most Texas teachers unions, the state board of education and several powerful legislators.\u000a\u000aIt is less certain whether Mr. Perot could have succeeded had he actually been in government. He did not have to worry about angering those whose support might be crucial for re-election. Some of his opponents say his acid tongue and occasional strong-arm tactics alienated many school insiders.\u000a\u000aRidiculing the widespread practice of making coaches principals, for example, Mr. Perot would ask all administrators to stand up during the public hearings he held across the state, recalled Becky Brooks, a teachers union lobbyist. Then he would ask those who were coaches to sit down. Nearly everybody sat, proving Mr. Perot's point, but humiliating coaches and many administrators.\u000a\u000aNor do observers agree on the lasting impact of the education law, although most believe it marked a dramatic step forward for Texas schools. Texas Whirlwind More Than State Had Bargained For\u000a\u000aThe education law that Mr. Perot helped shape and pass sought far-reaching changes. It gave Texas a preschool program for poor and non-English-speaking children. It transformed school finances, the state's first step toward redressing huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.\u000a\u000aTeachers received raises, but had to pass a competency test to keep their jobs. The law set maximum class sizes of 22 in early grades and required high-school students to pass a proficiency test to graduate. The infamous "no pass, no play" rule took on some of Texas's most sacred institutions, including football and county fairs, by forbidding students who failed a course to participate in extracurricular activities.\u000a\u000aTexas officials had not planned on legislation so sweeping. But Gov. Mark White had promised teachers raises, and he decided he needed an influential businessman to help persuade the Legislature to raise the taxes to pay for them. In June 1983 he asked Mr. Perot to head a Select Committee on Public Education. 9-Month Investigation\u000a\u000aGovernor White got more than he had bargained for. Mr. Perot set the committee's agenda from the start, plunging it into a nine-month investigation of Texas schools. He paid education experts to testify before his committee, commissioned surveys of Texas teachers, held committee meetings in plush Dallas hotels with catered meals, flew an entourage of about 50 people around the state for public hearings and paid Thomas W. Luce, a prominent attorney and now head of his petition drive, to manage the effort.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot did not like what he found, and he told Texans so in blunt, uncompromising terms. Texas had world-class education in only a few areas, he said: "drill team, band and football." The state would no longer be able to count on oil to stay prosperous; it's children would need solid educations to compete in a high-technology world.\u000a\u000aTexans did not care enough about education, he said. Schools spent money on towel warmers and multimillion-dollar stadiums. "Kids who can barely read and write are leaving school at noon to cook hamburgers so they can make payments on their cars," he told audiences. His signature anecdote was a story about the boy who had been absent from school 35 days so that he could exhibit his pet chicken at livestock shows.\u000a\u000aBut what got people talking was one state icon, Mr. Perot, taking on another: football, a game that defines Friday nights in Texas.\u000a\u000a"It was very difficult to tell during the heat of that battle whether he was a hero or Public Enemy No. 1," said George Christian, a lobbyist who later worked for Mr. Perot.\u000a\u000aTexans are still divided. Many who worked with him, and even some who fought him on the education bill, said he was a sympathetic listener, an engaging and convincing talker. Visionary or Demagogue?\u000a\u000aSome people complain that he didn't budge in the end. "When he talks about his town meetings, maybe Ross Perot has a vision of how things ought to be settled pre-town meeting, and maybe he uses the town meeting to solidify that," suggested Ms. Brooks, then president-elect of the Texas State Teachers Association, which fought the bill.\u000a\u000aSonia Hernandez, then a high-school principal and president of a grass-roots group working on school-finance issues, remembers a different Perot. After he had angered Hispanic parents by criticizing bilingual education, she asked him to reconsider and visit her school. "A couple of weeks later, I got this phone call out of the blue: Mr. Perot's in his plane, and he's going to land shortly, and he'd like to see what you're talking about." He came, listened and modified his position.\u000a\u000aOthers, however, saw him as dictatorial, simplistic and inflammatory. His cutting remarks made implacable enemies, like the longtime chairman of the State Board of Education, whose portrait, Mr. Perot once suggested, "may glow in the dark."\u000a\u000aHe attacked courses such as drivers' education: "That's where they house the assistant coaches who are too dumb to teach regular classes."\u000a\u000aMr. Joseph of the coaches association said, "A lot of it was demagoguery."\u000a\u000aDemagoguery or no, Mr. Perot's sound bite transfixed Texans, convincing many that their schools had to change. "That's where he came through, drawing up the final recommendations and selling them," said Camilla Bordie, who worked on the committee. "What was sold was the four or five main thrusts. You can kill the public with details, and he knows better than to do that." Lobbying Tactics Suffer No Fools, Take No Prisoners\u000a\u000aAt the opening of the June 1984 special legislative session convened to consider education reform, it appeared that Mr. Perot's bill was in serious trouble. He had angered many of the state's most powerful political groups: teachers unions, vocational educators, coaches, the State Board of Education and wealthy school districts that feared a drop in state aid.\u000a\u000aA member of the State Board of Education hosted a lavish barbecue for legislators at a lakeside retreat, with swimming, water skiing and volleyball. The message got through; a survey of legislators by a Texas newspaper when the session began showed only a few willing to vote for the bill.\u000a\u000aIn response, Mr. Perot unleashed a massive lobbying effort and drew on his influence in his home state. Mr. Perot loaned five of his own lobbyists and lawyers from Electronic Data Systems, his computer services company, to the effort, sent Mr. Luce to Austin to lead the charge, and hired three of the state's most influential lobbyists. He "hired anybody who was warm," recalled Bill Hobby, then Lieutenant Governor. Inspired a Verse\u000a\u000aMr. Perot even sent female employees from Electronic Data Systems to talk to legislators and help host parties -- a common practice and master stroke, Ms. Brooks of the teachers association says.\u000a\u000aMr. Hobby commemorated the E.D.S. women in a poem he wrote about the battle: What with taxes and all, Lobbyists were thick as roaches. So it took all the Luce women To win the war against coaches.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot helped forge a new alliance between traditional business groups and the state's growing high-technology industries, which were already demanding an improved education system. In the months before the session, he crisscrossed Texas addressing influential business groups: chambers of commerce, the Houston Board of Realtors, the Texas and Southwest Cattle Raisers Association. He videotaped his speech and sent it to places he did not visit personally.\u000a\u000a"Mr. Perot did essentially what Reagan did; he went beyond the system and appealed to the people and sold them on the need for reform," said Jack Vowell, a Republican state legislator from El Paso who opposed the bill. "If pressure came to me to support the movement, it did not come from Mr. Perot; it came from my constituents, who felt like this was a good idea."\u000a\u000aIn the fight to move the bill through the Legislature, Mr. Perot, or at least the lobbyists he hired, proved to be masterful coalition builders. To pay for the expensive education wish-list, lawmakers would have to raise taxes for the first time in 13 years. Mr. Perot's allies chose to increase gasoline taxes, assuring the help of the powerful highway lobby because most of the tax revenues would be used for roads. All or Nothing\u000a\u000aThe same stubborn refusal to compromise that makes some people wary of Mr. Perot proved invaluable in forcing fundamental educational changes after years of failed efforts, veterans of Texas political battles say. He insisted that lawmakers pass all his recommendations or none of them.\u000a\u000a"He did not permit the Legislature to cut it up in little pieces," said Craig Foster, executive director of the Equity Center, an association of poor school districts. "It shortcut all the usual nonsense. Leadership is bringing things to closure and getting on with it. That's what Ross Perot does better than anyone I've ever seen."\u000a\u000aAs influential as Mr. Perot was, he did not single-handedly turn around Texas education. Some of the most important political support and maneuvering came from Governor White, Lieutenant Governor Hobby and Gib Lewis, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. When the House Education Committee gutted the school bill in a daylong session, Mr. Lewis reportedly threatened to strip the chairman of his post unless he introduced a bill that incorporated Mr. Perot's recommendations.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot got much of the credit for the new law, but it was Governor White who paid a political price. He lost his re-election bid in 1986 -- a defeat he and others attributed to the anger of the powerful teacher unions and the coaches association. A Mixed Legacy Time Has Dimmed Legislation's Glory\u000a\u000aAt the time, the legislation was hailed by education experts as a quantum leap forward for Texas schools. The mid-1980's were a time when sweeping education acts were being enacted by several states, including Arkansas under Gov. Bill Clinton and Tennessee under Gov. Lamar Alexander, now Secretary of Education. Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, which monitors school reform around the country, called Texas's law a "reasonably good example," although he believes that South Carolina's changes were probably the best in the nation.\u000a\u000aYet even eight years later, some of the changes enacted in Texas's schools seem visionary -- particularly in early childhood education, school finance and public attitudes about education.\u000a\u000aTexas was ahead of its time in creating a state version of the Federal Head Start program for preschoolers. Educators continue to call for more emphasis on early childhood education, and Ms. Hernandez, now director of education for Gov. Ann W. Richards, says the impact of these programs in Texas has been enormous.\u000a\u000aThe law overhauled school financing, marking Texas's first real effort to address huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot's support for the last two provisions -- whose proponents at the time were generally liberals -- shows his political eclecticism.\u000a\u000aAnd his fighting words forever changed the political landscape in education. "A lot of people in their very own school districts started asking a lot of questions," said Ms. Bordie, who was on the committee staff. "A lot of the reforms that occurred were not the result of the Legislature so much as Perot highlighting the issue and making people pay more attention to what was going on in their own school."\u000a\u000aThe "no pass, no play" law infuriated many parents who felt that their children were being unfairly penalized, and it spawned a rush of lawsuits. But it also drove coaches to insure that their students got tutoring help, Ms. Hernandez said.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot lost one major battle. He wanted a permanently appointed State Board of Education, reasoning that an elected group would not take on powerful vested interests. The law did establish an appointed board for four years, but voters turned down a referendum that would have made it permanent. Mr. Cole says that defeat allowed many who opposed further changes to sabotage the law effectively. Mixed Record of Success\u000a\u000aAnd the 1984 law led to only modest improvements in student achievement. "We've had some changes in attitude, but, regrettably, many of the schools look the same as in 1983," said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, the only union that supported the bill.\u000a\u000aScores did climb steadily on the tests the law required, and the dropout rate fell from 34 percent to 21 percent. But that is still relatively high, and in the 1989-90 school year 23 percent of high-school seniors could not pass an English and math test required for graduation.\u000a\u000aSome of the legislated changes brought unforeseen problems, particularly in light of the deep recession that hit Texas after the law was passed. Limiting class sizes to 22 in the lower grades is still widely praised, but it forced school districts to hire more teachers, and it strained budgets. The school-finance system has been ruled unconstitutional three times in the last four years, twice because, despite the 1984 law, huge inequities remained between rich and poor school districts, and once because the remedy was financed with an illegal tax. It is still being challenged in the courts.\u000a\u000aSenator Parker, Governor White and nearly every teacher in Texas say that the teacher competency test, administered once in 1986, was a big mistake. Fewer than 1 percent of teachers failed, but the experience insulted and angered them.\u000a\u000a"He got crossways with teachers, and that could have been avoided," Senator Parker said.\u000a\u000aEducation experts now say that the Texas law, like others of those years, focused too much on rule-making and too little on setting goals for students and letting teachers help them achieve those goals any way that works.\u000a\u000a"In hindsight, they look very outmoded," Mr. Newman said. "But they said: 'Attention! The old world of half-baked schools isn't good enough.'

aVEAGLE GROVE, Iowa\u2014On a cloud-swept landscape dotted with grain elevators, a meat producer called Prestage Farms is building a 700,000-square-foot processing plant. The gleaming new factory is both the great hope of Wright County, which voted by a 2-1 margin for Donald Trump, and the victim of one of Trump\u2019s first policy moves, his decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u000a\u000aFor much of industrial America, the TPP was a suspect deal, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some argue led to a massive offshoring of U.S. jobs to Mexico. But for the already struggling agricultural sector, the sprawling 12-nation TPP, covering 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy, was a lifeline. It was a chance to erase punishing tariffs that restricted the United States\u2014the onetime \u201cbreadbasket of the world\u201d\u2014from selling its meats, grains and dairy products to massive importers of foodstuffs such as Japan and Vietnam.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe decision to pull out of the trade deal has become a double hit on places like Eagle Grove. The promised bump of $10 billion in agricultural output over 15 years, based on estimates by the U.S. International Trade Commission, won\u2019t materialize. But Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact also cleared the way for rival exporters such as Australia, New Zealand and the European Union to negotiate even lower tariffs with importing nations, creating potentially greater competitive advantages over U.S. exports.\u000a\u000aA POLITICO analysis found that the 11 other TPP countries are now involved in a whopping 27 separate trade negotiations with each other, other major trading powers in the region like China and massive blocs like the EU. Those efforts range from exploratory conversations to deals already signed and awaiting ratification. Seven of the most significant deals for U.S. farmers were either launched or concluded in the five months since the United States withdrew from the TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, whose North Carolina-based family pork and poultry business made its huge investment in the plant near Eagle Grove in part to reap expected gains from the TPP. \u201cI don\u2019t guess I\u2019ve gone beyond the point of no return on the new plant, but we did already start digging our wells and started moving dirt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and other agricultural businesspeople and workers have reason for concern.\u000a\u000aContrasting sharply with Eagle Grove\u2019s sleepy main thoroughfares, Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing is considered to be one of the busiest intersections in the world. While slow and small, Iowa towns such as Eagle Grove help supply much of the pork Japan imports. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aOn July 6, the EU, which already exports as much pork to Japan as the United States does, announced political agreement on a new deal that would give European pork farmers an advantage of up to $2 per pound over U.S. exporters under certain circumstances\u2014a move which, if unchecked, is all but certain to create a widening gap between EU exports and those from the United States.\u000a\u000aEuropean wine producers, who sold more than $1 billion to Japan between 2014 and 2016, would also see a 15 percent tariff on exports to Japan disappear while U.S. exporters would continue to face that duty at the border. For other products, the deal essentially mirrors the rates negotiated under the TPP, which the United States has surrendered, giving the EU a clear advantage over U.S. farmers.\u000a\u000aThe EU\u2019s deal is all the more noteworthy because American farmers were relying on the TPP\u2014to which the EU was not a member\u2014to give them an advantage over European competitors. But in a further rebuke to the United States, Tokyo decided within a matter of weeks to offer the European nations virtually the same agricultural access to its market that United States trade officials had spent two excruciating years extracting through near-monthly meetings with their Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the broader TPP negotiations; the United States is now left out.\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Without the TPP, Australian ranchers eventually will enjoy a 19 percent tariff advantage over U.S. competitors. Australia is also prioritizing the conclusion of trade talks with Indonesia, the largest nation in Southeast Asia by gross domestic product.\u000a\u000aThe remaining 11 TPP countries have already met two times, with a third meeting planned, to move ahead with the revival of the deal without the United States. The so-called TPP-11 would be in direct response to Trump\u2019s trade policy. Economic forecasts already show projected gains for countries involved. Canada, according to one estimate, could permanently gain an annual market share of $412 million in beef and $111 million in pork sales to Japan by 2035, because lower tariffs would enable it to eclipse America\u2019s position in the market.\u000a\u000aAs China, which was never a part of the TPP, senses blood in the water, it is moving quickly to assert itself, rather than the United States, as the region\u2019s trade arbiter. China is aiming to close talks by the end of this year on its behemoth Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\u2014a trade agreement involving 15 other Asia-Pacific countries.\u000a\u000aNone of these deals are yet in effect. But already there are signs that competitors are gaining market share over U.S. producers in the post-TPP landscape, as Pacific nations take a closer look at alternatives to U.S. exporters.\u000a\u000aOver the first five months of 2017, U.S. exports to Japan of chilled pork, which is preferable to frozen meat, are up 2 percent over the previous year. But exports of chilled pork from Canada, a prime competitor, are up 19 percent. Likewise, in frozen pork, U.S. exports are up 28 percent. But exports from the EU, the leading competitor, are up 44 percent.\u000a\u000aJapan, which saw the TPP not only as a source of economic growth but a counterweight to China, is now taking the lead in salvaging the deal. Its goal is to have some sort of agreement between the 11 other countries in place for the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in November. Trump is expected to attend, creating the awkward possibility that he will witness all the handshakes and back slaps as his fellow leaders congratulate themselves on a deal.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Trump once promised a slew of \u201cbeautiful\u201d deals to replace the TPP, but his administration has yet to lay out a detailed strategy. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that an analysis is underway to determine where it makes most sense to pursue negotiations.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Lighthizer, a trade attorney who pressured Japan to voluntarily restrain its steel exports when he was a trade official in the 1980s, said Tokyo should just go ahead and lower their tariffs without expecting anything in return.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think in the areas like beef and the others, they ought to be making some unilateral concessions, at least temporary concessions,\u201d he told lawmakers in June. \u201cAnd I don't quite understand why that doesn't happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aLighthizer said the administration still hopes to strike bilateral trade deals\u2014that is, separate agreements with individual countries\u2014but he conceded that "some of the TPP countries don't want to do bilaterals." The value of the TPP for many countries was that they could justify giving up protective tariffs in exchange for their own access to the markets of a wide pool of countries; many are unwilling to make such concessions for the smaller gains of a bilateral deal.\u000a\u000aLighthizer acknowledged that even Japan, at least for the time being, may not be interested in one-on-one negotiations with the U.S.\u000a\u000aLighthizer declined to comment for this report, and the White House directed questions to the Agriculture Department. But Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, which is more overtly pro-trade than other pockets of the administration, said in a statement that \u201cSecretary [Sonny] Perdue is committed to expanding our playing field for American agricultural exports,\u201d and has met with his counterparts in Canada, Mexico and China.\u000a\u000aMurtaugh cited administration gains in \u201cgetting beef into the Chinese market\u201d and securing access for American rice growers to China, \u201cthe largest rice market in the world.\u201d Both moves came out of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, though they had been worked on intensively during the Obama administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt goes right along with the secretary\u2019s new motto for USDA, \u2018Do right and feed everyone,\u2019\u201d Murtaugh wrote.\u000a\u000aHe made no mention of efforts to fill in the gaps left by the country\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, which are more in Lighthizer\u2019s purview.\u000a\u000aThat leaves workers in 13,000-person Wright County, whose survival depends largely on agriculture, with relatively few signs of optimism. Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from the TPP has stoked uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and, more notably, the president\u2019s commitment to rural America.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe fooled a lot of people,\u201d said Sandy McGrath, mayor of Eagle Grove, who is not affiliated with any party and did not support Trump.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn Wright County, a trainload of corn can be in Mexico in three days, tens of thousands of hogs are being raised just for export to Japan and farmers routinely travel to far-flung places like Indonesia and the Philippines to market their goods.\u000a\u000aThis community roughly 100 miles north of Des Moines, checker boarded with corn and soybean fields and dotted with silos, may seem far from the raging debate over globalism sparked by Trump\u2019s presidency, but it\u2019s actually right at the center.\u000a\u000aSandy McGrath, the mayor of Eagle Grove, is shown at Rails Bar and Grill, which she owns and operates. The area\u2019s \u201cskyline\u201d is punctuated by soybean processing facilities like the one shown here. Farmer Jerry Maier, right, and Jim Christ chat inside Christ\u2019s furniture store. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe county\u2019s residents are grappling with life under a Trump presidency and all its unanswered questions: Will the president\u2019s next tweet about trade send commodity prices crashing? Will Trump ever follow through on his promise to create new opportunities through bilateral trade deals? And, even more pressing: Will the new plant that Prestage is building be able to hire a second shift of workers, helping families who have struggled through the recent agricultural downturn?\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not say I trust the president\u2019s judgment right now,\u201d said McGrath, a registered nurse who grew up on a nearby farm and owns one of the town\u2019s main watering holes\u2014Rails Bar and Grill, named for its proximity to the rail line that that carries cars loaded with grain and feed.\u000a\u000aEagle Grove\u2019s skyline is already punctuated by feed grain elevators and a soybean processing facility. Now it\u2019s further staking its future on Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant, roughly five miles south of town past the Dollar General, the Family Table restaurant and a Ford dealership.\u000a\u000aThe plant represents an opportunity not many Midwest towns the size of Eagle Grove are afforded given today's economic realities.\u000a\u000aMcGrath said the plant will bring much-needed jobs to the area, which has had a dwindling population for years. From its 1970 height of 4,489 people, the town suffered a 31 percent decline in population to 3,427 in 2016. Now Eagle Grove is expecting at least 200 of the 900 workers the plant will initially employ to find housing in the town. This would give a sorely needed boost to retailers and service providers, as well.\u000a\u000aBut the plant\u2019s success will depend largely on export opportunities. More than 26 percent of the pork produced in the U.S. in 2016 was exported to foreign markets. And more than $1.5 billion of the nearly $6 billion in U.S. pork exports in 2016 headed for Japan.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the time those investment decisions were made, the U.S. had never turned down a free trade opportunity,\u201d said Dermot Hayes, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University, referring to the Prestage plant and other pork-industry investments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, referring to Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the TPP. The family-owned Prestage Farms is building a pork processing facility outside Eagle Grove that depends on a robust export market. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aHayes said the livestock industry had in its sights a future of expansion amid soaring export growth. After Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, \u201cthat has pretty much disappeared,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMost in the industry expected a coming boom from exports as a result of TPP, with continued strong sales made possible by NAFTA. Vietnam, another growing market where U.S. producers were set to expand sales of organ meat and other items not easily sold domestically, was prepared to eliminate its tariffs altogether under TPP. Now, the tariffs remain and Prestage\u2014and all of Eagle Grove\u2014are holding their breath.\u000a\u000aPrestage said his company\u2019s plant should be operational by the fall of 2018, but any move to add a second shift or expand production will largely depend on new trade opportunities.\u000a\u000aExuding gentle defiance, Prestage said even if he had known the TPP would fail, he still would have gone ahead with the plant. His family\u2019s business raises, mainly through contract growers, more than 1.5 million hogs in Iowa alone. Consolidation in the meatpacking industry has forced companies like Prestage to sell hogs to a few major players like Tyson Foods and JBS.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was time for there to be some modernization in the U.S. packing industry,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWith future export opportunities in question, the success of the plant will now be tied to what business it can displace from less efficient and older processing facilities. It also will face competition. The Prestage plant is one of two new major pork processing plants being built in Iowa and one of five new facilities going up nationwide.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think that Trump is naïve enough to not recognize the value of trade deals to the U.S.,\u201d Prestage said in an interview at his Eagle Grove office, a nondescript former bank building on the town\u2019s main drag. \u201cI just think he has an unusual way of introducing what his policy is going to be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI sure hope I\u2019m right about that,\u201d he added after a pause.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAsk anyone involved in the county\u2019s agriculture sector their thoughts on Trump as president and his stance on trade, and you get a carefully thought-out response. Like many of those in Trump\u2019s rural base, they are distrustful of the coastal elites who are blocking his agenda, even as they wish that he would alter his own abrasive style and think more about those who got him elected.\u000a\u000a\u201cI still believe what he is saying he is going to follow through on, but his management style isn\u2019t quite how at least people in the Midwest do things,\u201d said Stu Swanson, who farms corn, soybeans and pork outside Galt, a tiny hamlet near the center of the county.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a Midwest style and there\u2019s his style,\u201d he said from his living room, where the panorama from the windows is dotted by the white-roofed livestock barns in the distance.\u000a\u000aGround is prepared to host Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant south of Eagle Grove, Iowa. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aSwanson acknowledged his own household is split over its support for Trump. Trump, he figured, would be the best positioned to tamp down the rising health care costs for his own family and his one farmhand that he believes to be connected to the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aBut on trade, Swanson was less sure where Trump drew the line between campaign-trail bluster and real action. There was, he thought, far too much at stake for his rural base to make any rash decisions. Then, three days after he was sworn in, Trump made good on a promise to drop U.S. support for TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was disappointed Trump kind of broadly wiped out TPP before there was even a discussion,\u201d Swanson said.\u000a\u000aJerry Maier, a Wright County corn and soybean farmer who supported Trump, said he feels the same way.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re at the table and nothing happens, that\u2019s one thing. But if you aren\u2019t even at that table, that\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe downward trend of commodity prices has been a lingering reality for the third-generation farmer who lives just outside Eagle Grove. The USDA\u2019s annual farm income report forecasts that net farm income will drop this year by 8.7 percent, compared with 2016. Incomes have been decreasing steadily since 2013 when they hit an all-time high of more than $120 billion. The forecast for this year projects net incomes down to little more than $62.3 billion.\u000a\u000aMaier, for one, has had to find new ways to earn extra income from grinding tree stumps to hauling gravel using trucks that usually carry grain. After a wet planting season this spring, he expects to once again barely break even on his crops.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are pretty resilient about making no money for a few years, but you gotta make money at some point,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMaier is as vigilant as any commodity trader, scrutinizing corn and soybean prices multiple times a day as alerts come in on the smartphone he carries on his belt.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s also aware that any extra margin on his crops, barring any unforeseen demand domestically, will largely depend on new overseas markets. He recently hosted a contingent of South Korean grain buyers on his farm and traveled to the Philippines and Indonesia last year to seek new contracts for Iowa farmers.\u000a\u000aIn April, when Trump was on the verge of withdrawing from NAFTA, Maier said he watched corn prices plummet in anticipation of the president\u2019s decision. Trump relented, at the request of Perdue, the agriculture secretary, who appealed to the president with colorful maps showing the president's base was largely concentrated in states that heavily rely on agriculture.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Trump agreed to renegotiations with Canada and Mexico instead. But Maier remains wary that, despite pledges by the administration to "do no harm" for agriculture, the mere act of reopening the deal with Canada and Mexico, the two largest destinations for U.S. agricultural exporters, could mess up what has been a very good thing for American farmers in the Midwest.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are willing to open up NAFTA, but if we open up NAFTA, there's the risk of going backwards,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aWright County produces 800,000 hogs per year and is one of the top 20 pork-producing counties in the country. Put those pigs next to the more than 6.5 million egg-laying hens (the county is first in the nation in egg production) and that creates a huge demand for corn and soybean for feed.\u000a\u000aStu Swanson farms corn, soybeans and pork near Galt, Iowa. While Swanson sells most of his pork to local processors, he is still concerned how Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of TPP could impact neighbors and corporate producers. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe supply chain from field, to feed, to animal has created a massive livestock industry that doesn\u2019t always find demand among American consumers. The dimming of any new trade opportunities or the disruption of existing ones creates a ripple effect not only vertically along the direct farm value chain but horizontally into the economic welfare of the surrounding community.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the farmers have a bad year, we all have a bad year. If the farmers have a good year, we all have a good year,\u201d said Melia Hansen, a hair stylist on Eagle Grove\u2019s main street.\u000a\u000aSuccessfully growing a business in today\u2019s agricultural economy has become more reliant on trade as farmers consolidate and massively scale up their production to better compete. In 1940, the Agriculture Department census found that the average Iowa farm was 160 acres. By 2012, when the last census was conducted, the average acreage in Wright County was 464.\u000a\u000aThe success of the community as a whole is growing more reliant on the fortunes of fewer farmers growing even more grain and livestock.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers spend a quarter- to a half-million dollars on a combine,\u201d said Ethan Bubeck, who runs a local meat processing business in Eagle Grove that buys hogs from farmers who also sell to the major meat processors. \u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018American Gothic\u2019 picture of the guy with a pitchfork. This is big business.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe economic outlook for Wright County would certainly be a lot less hopeful without the Prestage plant, but there is broad recognition that trade will largely drive any future growth, said Bryce Davis, director of the county\u2019s economic development department.\u000a\u000aCustomers have their beauty needs taken care of at Reflections Salon, a renovated bank building along Broadway Street in Eagle Grove. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aAs commodities like corn and soybeans continue to languish, Davis excitedly talks about the export potential of \u201cvalue-added agriculture\u201d beyond pork production.\u000a\u000aAfter an earlier proposal to build Prestage\u2019s plant about 70 miles away near Mason City was turned down, Davis sent an unsolicited email to the company to see whether they\u2019d be interested in scoping out Wright County as a possible location.\u000a\u000aNow, fresh off the major coup of reeling in Prestage, the young, energetic economic development professional sees more opportunity in everything from aquaculture to getting more farmers to grow hops to harness the new global fervor for craft beer.\u000a\u000aHe dreams of a time when the county could become a seafood exporter 1,000 miles away from the closest ocean. The concept is already bringing success to nearby Webster City where a company called VeroBlue is expanding its operations for raising barramundi, a flaky white fish native to Australia. The company, which already farms fish in old pork production facilities, acquired the building that once housed the town\u2019s primary employer, an Electrolux washing machine factory that shut down in 2011 and relocated in Juárez, Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know we need these trade agreements in place to provide an opportunity for Iowa farmers to sell their products,\u201d Davis said.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration, backed by a large cadre of free-trade Republicans, used that reality to grow support for the TPP among businesses and agricultural interests eager to grab a better foothold in a fast-growing area of the world where the U.S. has few formal trade deals.\u000a\u000aWorkers at Lewright Meats prepare hog products for sale at their Eagle Grove shop. The family-run business specializes in custom processing for beef and pork farmers while operating a popular deli up front. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut through the slow churn of negotiations, the dazzlingly complex deal among 12 countries soon fell victim to time and circumstance. After more than five years of talks, bleary-eyed trade negotiators were finally able to close the deal at an Atlanta hotel on October 5, 2015. But the agreement quickly became mired in election politics. Labor unions and blue-collar voters declared it to be a successor to NAFTA, which was blamed for the loss of factories. And while the U.S. trade commission predicted the deal would be broadly beneficial to the overall economy, some areas including food and agriculture were predicted to score more gains than others.\u000a\u000aEven as supporters of the deal insisted it would put U.S. manufacturers on a stronger footing versus overseas competitors by enforcing higher labor and environmental standards, Trump and Bernie Sanders used anti-TPP fervor as a key plank of their campaign platforms, declaring that it would cost America jobs. Even Hillary Clinton, normally a supporter of freer trade, turned on the deal, saying she wanted to negotiate better terms.\u000a\u000aTrump escalated his rhetoric on trade after the primaries and Congress, which has final say on trade deals, shied away from bringing TPP up for a vote. After Trump\u2019s victory, the fate of the deal in the GOP-controlled Congress was all but sealed as Republican lawmakers put it aside to concentrate on tax reform and a bid to roll back Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOn his first full day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing from the TPP, calling the action a \u201cgreat thing for the American worker.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country,\u201d Trump said during a campaign stop in Ohio. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, too. It\u2019s a harsh word: It\u2019s a rape of our country.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aBut even as Iowa was voting for Trump by 51 percent-42 percent, its farmers were looking to Asia as their savior.\u000a\u000aThroughout the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, an expanding middle class is demanding higher-quality protein\u2014causing enormous demand for meat. U.S. pork producers can find Asian buyers for just about everything cut out of a hog carcass\u2014from the highest-priced loin to the cheaper organ meats that are hard to sell to U.S. consumers.\u000a\u000aThe boom in Asia is so powerful that, even with the dim trade outlook stemming from its pullout from the TPP, U.S. pork exports continued to grow through April of this year. In the first four months of 2017, 27.5 percent of total U.S. pork production was exported, up from 24.4 percent last year. Exports to Japan in April were 5 percent higher than a year ago by volume and up 10 percent in value.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Meat Export Federation has pushed an aggressive marketing campaign for pork and beef, portraying American meats as premium products. In Japanese supermarkets, American pork is branded with a logo featuring Gochipo, a cute animated pig that sometimes even makes appearances in mascot form to encourage shoppers to buy premium, thick cuts of U.S.-produced pork.\u000a\u000aIn Japan, it\u2019s hard to promote products in a landscape cluttered with color. So the U.S. Meat Export Federation developed a lovable character, Gochipo, to serve as its ambassador for American pork. While domestic pork holds 51 percent of the market, the U.S. leads all import products at 15 percent, just ahead of Canada\u2019s 10 percent market share. USMEF regularly hosts pork tastings in grocery stores and offers special promotions in restaurants and malls throughout the Tokyo region. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut it could soon just be a matter of time until consumers in those countries will choose a lower-cost product.\u000a\u000aGrowth in Canadian chilled-pork exports to Japan is already outpacing those of the United States, as buyers in Japan have already been looking to diversify their sources after a disease outbreak spiked prices in 2014 and a West Coast ports shutdown further roiled the market in 2015. If Canada clinches a deal with Japan through a revived TPP where it would gain a price advantage, little would stop Canadian pork from overtaking U.S. share of the market, which has already dipped from 70 percent in 2012 to 55 percent this year.\u000a\u000aThe EU, a major pork exporter, is also closing in on both the Japanese market and fast-growing Vietnam. Japan ended up offering the EU the same deal on pork it did to the United States under the TPP after the EU gave Tokyo favorable access for its cars. In Vietnam, frozen pork imported from the EU will be duty-free seven years after the deal with Brussels goes into force.\u000a\u000aHayes, of Iowa State University, is deeply worried about the threat these deals represent. \u201cInstead of getting those 200 million customers we may be, in fact, at a disadvantage in those markets because these are preferential trade agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not part of it, you are on the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most immediate example of U.S. producers losing out is the case of Australian beef. In its lobbying drive on the TPP, the U.S. beef industry at one time even kept a website complete with a counter continuously ticking off the amount of sales to Japan it was losing to Australia. Now, Australia is speeding up the clock.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe count on a bigger market share,\u201d declared Michael Finucan, general manager for international markets for Meat and Livestock Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have a tariff advantage in that market for quite a number of years.\u201d\u000a\u000aAustralia's tariff advantage was boosted even more after Japan imposed an additional 11.5 percent tariff on imports of U.S. frozen beef on August 1. U.S. exports of the product had risen to a level of triggering a \u201csafeguard\u201d measure meant to protect domestic cattle producers. That tariff hike won't apply to Australia since it has a trade deal with Tokyo and wouldn't have applied to the United States if the TPP were in place.\u000a\u000aAustralian exports to Japan are expected to catch up with the United States, with Australia enjoying a tariff this year of 27.5 percent compared with the 50 percent the United States now faces with the safeguard in place. The TPP would have cut tariffs to 9 percent for both Australia and the United States.\u000a\u000aAfter years of drought, Australia\u2019s ranchers are rebuilding their herds. Although the scale of Australia\u2019s production may never match that of the United States, Finucan said there is increasing demand for the type of grass-fed beef Australia is best known for producing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment, there is a shift toward health as a lot of developed countries are in the same space,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are questioning the amount of marbling in beef and looking for a leaner product. It\u2019s obviously a place Australia can play well with our grass-fed beef.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aSitting comfortably on a couch overlooking the expanse of sea from the lobby of a beachfront hotel in Vina del Mar, Chile, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo has his gaze fixed across the Pacific.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s March 15 and, a few hours previously, the 11 current TPP countries were finally able to offer a unified response to Trump\u2019s announcement from January: Don\u2019t expect the trade agreement to fade away.\u000a\u000aThe meeting on Chile\u2019s coast represented a major turning point on trade for Asia-Pacific countries facing life in the Trump era. Not only did the remaining TPP countries reaffirm their commitment to retain the benefits of the deal, but Chile and its Latin American trade allies in the Pacific Alliance announced their own efforts to advance regional trade integration by pursuing trade deals with other countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe continue to engage with the world,\u201d Ciobo said matter-of-factly, while sipping a Coke.\u000a\u000aHe said his highest priority was completing negotiations for a trade deal with Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest country, where the United States has no agreement. Leaders from Australia and Indonesia agreed on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in July to reach a deal by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy job as Australia\u2019s trade and investment minister is to pursue Australia\u2019s national interests, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d Ciobo said, when asked whether Australia is actively seeking to take market share from the United States. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ll pursue our trade and investment agenda through multilateral, plurilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements.\u201d\u000a\u000aWorkers offload a shipment of pork from a Perry, Iowa processor as it arrives at a massive cold storage facility along the shipyards in Tokyo, Japan. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe same sentiment came from New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay when he was in Washington in June for his first one-on-one meeting with Lighthizer.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur experience is wherever a vacuum is created, it\u2019s filled very, very quickly,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t stay still.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as senior trade officials from countries in the Pacific region waste no time acting on new opportunities created by America\u2019s absence, they recognize it\u2019s still early days for the Trump administration on trade.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the first few months of an administration and the first few weeks of a USTR being in place, we need to show the understanding and courtesy to allow that strategy and policy to develop,\u201d McClay said.\u000a\u000aBut despite Trump\u2019s intense personal interest in trade, the White House has been slow to build the dream team of negotiators the president promised on the campaign trail. Lighthizer, who once served as a deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed on May 11. The people tapped to serve in the agency\u2019s three deputy positions await confirmation, as does the administration\u2019s pick for chief agriculture negotiator.\u000a\u000aIowa\u2019s Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley says he thinks a trade deal with Japan would make up for much that was lost for agriculture by dropping TPP, but it will take \u201ca lot more personnel, a lot more time to get it done, a lot more separate actions by Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs far as the administration\u2019s strategy to get there, Grassley, who still owns his farm in Butler County, Iowa, said he hasn\u2019t gotten much direction.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked Lighthizer maybe a month ago in a meeting, and I didn\u2019t get an answer,\u201d Grassley said in a recent interview. \u201cIn a sense he answered, but not very definitively because their policy isn\u2019t established.\u201d\u000a\u000aIowa farmer Grant Woodley inside his 4,800-head hog confinement facility near Clarion, Iowa. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aFor Grant Woodley and the 4,800 hogs he is raising for export to Japan, that uncertainty is worrisome.\u000a\u000aWoodley and his wife, both Lutheran ministers, moved back to Wright County from Des Moines a few years ago to help with his family\u2019s farm. They made a major investment two years ago in a state-of-the-art livestock facility, knowing that the margin on soybeans and corn alone wouldn\u2019t provide a sustainable source of income to keep the farm, which has been in his family for more than 100 years.\u000a\u000aHis current contract has him raising hogs for the Japanese market. That involves feeding the animals a diet free from certain additives and following more restrictive guidelines on antibiotic use. He knows any profit he might get on futures contracts for any hogs raised for export will largely depend on whether the trading relationships tilt in favor of the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe world is going find it wherever it\u2019s cheapest,\u201d said Woodley, who made clear he did not support Trump in the election.\u000a\u000aStability and predictability were two key principles for Woodley. So far, he doesn\u2019t see any of that coming out of the Trump administration when it comes to his trade policy and ability to strike new deals.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreating instability is not good business practice when there are fierce and competitive producers around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cStability and predictability are tremendous to me as I seek out business partnerships, so why would it be any different for any other country we work with?\u201d

aVRichard Nixon\u2019s telephone calls came regularly during the 1968 campaign. And H.R. Haldeman took meticulous notes, jotting down the instructions he received from the candidate.\u000a\u000aSometimes Nixon needed to blow off steam: demanding that a reporter from The Washington Post or The New York Times be banned from his campaign airplane for writing an offending story. (\u201cTimes and Post off,\u201d Haldeman recorded. \u201cTimes forever.\u201d) One such call came at midnight, from Nixon\u2019s co-op apartment on Fifth Avenue: Haldeman dutifully noted that the stirring score to the World War II documentary Victory at Sea, which Nixon so enjoyed, was playing on a phonograph in the background.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOther calls were steeped in intrigue. In one series of scribbles, Haldeman reported Henry Kissinger\u2019s willingness to inform on his U.S. diplomatic colleagues, and keep Nixon updated on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s furious, eleventh-hour efforts to end the Vietnam War.\u000a\u000aHaldeman, 42, was Nixon\u2019s campaign chief of staff, a devoted political adjutant since the 1950s. In late October 1968, the two men connected on what came to be known as \u201cthe Chennault Affair.\u201d Nixon gave Haldeman his orders: Find ways to sabotage Johnson\u2019s plans to stage productive peace talks, so that a frustrated American electorate would turn to the Republicans as their only hope to end the war.\u000a\u000aThe gambit worked, and the Chennault Affair, named for Anna Chennault, the Republican doyenne and fundraiser who became Nixon\u2019s back channel to the South Vietnamese government, lingered as a diplomatic and political whodunit for decades afterward.\u000a\u000aJohnson and his aides suspected this treachery at the time, for the Americans were eavesdropping on their South Vietnamese allies\u2014(\u201cHold on,\u201d Anna was heard telling the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington. \u201cWe are gonna win\u201d)\u2014but hesitated to expose it because they had no proof Nixon had personally directed, or countenanced, her actions. Historians scoured archives for evidence that Chennault was following the future president\u2019s instructions, without much luck. Nixon steadfastly denied involvement up until his death, while his lawyers fended off efforts to obtain records from the 1968 campaign.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t until after 2007, when the Nixon Presidential Library finally opened Haldeman\u2019s notes to the public, that I stumbled upon a smoking gun in the course of conducting research for my biography of Nixon: four pages of notes his brush-cut aide had scrawled late on an October evening in 1968. \u201c!Keep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\u201d Haldeman wrote, as Nixon barked orders into the phone. They were out to \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d Johnson\u2019s election eve initiative, Nixon said. And it worked.\u000a\u000aThe following account of the Chennault Affair is the most up-to-date and revealing exposure of Nixon\u2019s intrigue\u2014the product of hours of archival research, open records requests and a little luck. Documenting this cynical maneuver is important for history\u2019s sake, but the fact that it took nearly 50 years for Nixon\u2019s secret to emerge also offers vital lessons for today. It shows how hard it is to find definitive proof of collaboration with a foreign power when officials are determined to hide the truth. It illustrates why a president might hesitate to call out such malfeasance by a candidate from the opposing political party. And it demonstrates the lengths an ambitious politician will go in the pursuit of power\u2014even at the expense of his own country\u2019s interests.\u000a\u000aAs investigators rush to understand just what President Donald Trump knew about Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in the 2016 election and when he knew it, the Chennault Affair\u2014and how Nixon got away with it\u2014is as relevant than ever.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aNixon was especially anxious on the night October 22, 1968. He had entered the fall campaign with a formidable lead over Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but the polls were narrowing as working-class Democrats returned to their party and Johnson\u2019s efforts to make peace made news. Nixon believed he would prevail, unless a major event reset the political topography. He knew that Johnson knew that too.\u000a\u000aAs did the Soviet Union. Kremlin leaders had never much liked the red-baiting, anti-communist Nixon. To keep him from the Oval Office, and help Humphrey become president, they were meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign\u2014pressing their clients in North Vietnam to agree to a ceasefire and hold constructive talks to end the war.\u000a\u000aAccording to Haldeman\u2019s notes, Kissinger alerted the Nixon campaign in late September, and again in early October, that something was up. Johnson was willing to halt the U.S. bombing of the North, and with the Soviets applying pressure on Hanoi to meet certain American conditions, the odds were never better for an early settlement of the conflict, which had already claimed 30,000 American lives and torn America apart.\u000a\u000aNixon had no influence in Moscow, or Hanoi. But he was not completely vulnerable to events. He had that pipeline to Saigon, where South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and his associates feared that LBJ was selling them out. If Thieu would drag his feet, and stall the proposed peace talks, Nixon could portray Johnson\u2019s failed peace initiative as a desperate political trick. But to do so, Nixon had to get word to Thieu, and tell him to stand firm.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s main conduit was Chennault, the Chinese-American widow of Claire Chennault, the American aviator who led squadrons of \u201cFlying Tigers\u201d into battle on behalf of China against the Japanese invaders during World War II. She had many friends in the palaces of South Vietnam, nationalist China and the other pro-Western countries on the Asian rim.\u000a\u000aNixon also told Haldeman to have Rose Mary Woods, the candidate\u2019s devoted secretary, contact another member of the pro-nationalist \u201cChina Lobby\u201d\u2014businessman Louis Kung\u2014and have him pressure Thieu as well. She was to get Kung \u201cgoing on the SVN\u2014tell him hold firm,\u201d Nixon ordered Haldeman.\u000a\u000aAnna Chennault (left) sits with Republican presidential candidate John Connally just before Connally addressed the National Republican Heritage Groups Council in Washington, D.C. in 1979. | AP Photos\u000a\u000aThe Nixon campaign\u2019s sabotage of Johnson\u2019s peace process was successful. Nine days later, Thieu\u2019s decision to boycott the talks headlined The New York Times and other U.S. newspapers, reminding American voters of their long-harbored mistrust of the wheeler-dealer LBJ and his \u201ccredibility gap\u201d on Vietnam. Humphrey\u2019s momentum faded.\u000a\u000aLBJ was furious. His national security adviser, Walt Rostow, urged him to unmask Nixon\u2019s treachery. Humphrey\u2019s aides told their boss to expose the episode and disgrace their Republican foes. But Johnson and Humphrey balked. They didn\u2019t have proof that Nixon had personally directed her actions.\u000a\u000aAnd so Nixon won the 1968 election, and led America further into carnage in Southeast Asia. In the years that followed, many elements of the Chennault Affair came to light, but Nixon stuck by his denials that he participated in the scheme. The lack of evidence of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement gave pause to historians, and offered his loyalists a platform from which to defend him. But no longer. Haldeman\u2019s notes are the long-sought evidence that Nixon personally intervened to scuttle Johnson\u2019s efforts to end the war. It\u2019s now possible to reconstruct the events of October and November 1968 with the inescapable conclusion that Nixon\u2019s behavior was devious, tragic and, given the lives at stake, arguably more reprehensible than his activities in the Watergate scandal.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aHow did Haldeman\u2019s notes escape public scrutiny for almost 50 years? When Nixon took office in January 1969, Haldeman was rewarded for his decades of service with the job of White House chief of staff. He built a centralized organization that, in many aspects, remains the preferred model today. No detail\u2014the grocery lists for the president\u2019s vacation home in Key Biscayne, Florida; the wages of the gardeners at the Western White House in San Clemente, California; the supply of toilet paper at Camp David\u2014was beyond his purview. Throughout the Nixon presidency, he spent hours in the Oval Office, recording the president\u2019s instructions on matters great and small.\u000a\u000aIn the spring of 1972, nearing the end of Nixon\u2019s first term, Haldeman ordered a general reorganization of the White House filing system. His aides selected the most sensitive documents from the White House Central Files and placed them in a group that was called the White House Special Files. The Special Files were like a greatest hits collection of Nixon administration secrets.\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon resigned in 1974, aides to his successor, Gerald Ford, alerted the president, Congress and Watergate prosecutors that truckloads of Nixon\u2019s papers were being shipped to San Clemente. Ford put a stop to the process (infuriating the exiled ex-president) and Congress enacted special legislation that, effectively, seized the documents and the famous White House tapes.\u000a\u000aAll previous chief executives had retained control of their papers\u2014and then chose to bequeath them to heirs, sell them or store them in a presidential library. Nixon had sound grounds to contest the government\u2019s seizure of his tapes and papers\u2014especially those of a personal, or purely political nature. He went to court, and his legal team scored victory after victory. After one favorable decision, aide Monica Crowley later reported, the elated former president sat down at the piano and banged out \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again.\u201d\u000a\u000aNixon fretted, with good cause, about his legacy. By the time of his death, in 1994, he had succeeded in keeping all but a few reels of the White House tapes, and tens of thousands of sensitive documents, from historians and biographers. The tapes began to trickle out in 1996, though some 700 of the 3,600 hours of conversations are still being processed today. Most of the touchy Special Files were opened to researchers in 1987, with the exception of two segments of records categorized as \u201creturned\u201d to Nixon or \u201ccontested\u201d by the former president as containing personal or political material.\u000a\u000aStoring, preserving and processing tapes and papers costs a great deal of money, however, which has led the various private presidential foundations to reach arrangements with the National Archives to reduce costs. The result is that today\u2019s presidential libraries are chimeras, with donor-funded, hagiographic museum halls for the public to wander and climate-controlled vaults of records, administered by federal archivists, for researchers. And so, after all those years of legal battles, the privately funded Richard Nixon Foundation ultimately surrendered the \u201creturned\u201d and \u201ccontested\u201d Special Files to the government. They were opened to scholars beginning in 2007. They include Bob Haldeman\u2019s political files\u2014where I found his notes from the 1968 campaign.\u000a\u000aConsidering their provenance, the twin collections have drawn surprisingly little attention. Sifting through the files is laborious, for there is much trivia\u2014like memos from Nixon staffers to have secretaries pick up their dry cleaning \u2013 but they also contain gems like Nixon\u2019s appointment books, political strategy memos and the Haldeman files, in which he stored his notes from his boss\u2019 stunning comeback in 1968, and the 1962 California gubernatorial race\u2014the one that ended with Nixon\u2019s famous \u201clast press conference,\u201d in which he told reporters \u201cyou don\u2019t have Nixon to kick around anymore.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 1962 folders contain notes from a strategy meeting in which Nixon, Haldeman and other top advisers discuss the need to have rival candidates \u201ctailed and tapped.\u201d Long before Watergate, Nixon was fascinated with such sneakery\u2014in yet another file at the Nixon library I found a page of reminders he had written to himself during his first campaign for Congress, against Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis, in 1946. \u201cSet up \u2026 spies in V. camp,\u201d he had scribbled.\u000a\u000aHaldeman is known as Nixon\u2019s alter ego; as the highest-ranked White House aide to go to prison for his Watergate era crimes; for participating in the \u201csmoking gun\u201d conversation that incriminated Nixon, and for the meticulous \u201cHaldeman diaries,\u201d published as a best-selling book in 1994. Until the Nixon White House taping system was installed in early 1971, Haldeman\u2019s notes and diary entries formed the best, most candid record of its internal reckonings. His notes from the 1968 campaign are equally essential.\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d threatened to unravel at the Republican National Convention in Miami, with the South\u2019s delegates yearning to switch to the more conservative Ronald Reagan, Haldeman recorded how Nixon dispatched his campaign manager, John Mitchell, to reassure Peter O\u2019Donnell, the Texas state Republican chairman, with a message to \u201ccool off the Southerners.\u201d They should know, Nixon said, that in choosing a running mate he would not \u201cram someone down your throat.\u201d They should also know that Nixon \u201cwill bring peace\u201d on civil rights and \u201clay off pro-Negro crap\u201d\u2014 the most explicit promise that I found from a candidate who preferred to cloak his position on segregation in euphemistic talk about pushy liberal bureaucrats and the folly of court-ordered busing.\u000a\u000aHaldeman also noted Nixon\u2019s musings about how best to deal with the third-party candidacy of Alabama Governor George Wallace. \u201cRN has emotional access to lower middle class white \u2013 not fair [to call them] racist \u2013 but concerned re crime & violence, law & order,\u201d Haldeman noted. The Roman Catholic minorities \u2013 \u201cIrish, Ital, Pole, Mex\u201d \u2013 were \u201cafraid of Negroes,\u201d and should be targeted after the convention. \u201cNeed stronger N position on this operationally \u2013 must do something,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cMust dry up Wallace vote.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are early hints of Watergate, too\u2014with Nixon telling Haldeman to leak word to a friendly journalist that Humphrey and his campaign manager, Lawrence O\u2019Brien, had potentially embarrassing ties to the eccentric defense contractor, billionaire Howard Hughes. \u201cHave learned\u2014unimpeachable source,\u201d Nixon told Haldeman. \u201cHH son has been on H Hughes payroll & O\u2019Brien is financed by H Hughes.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 1960, John Kennedy\u2019s campaign had effectively exploited news of a Hughes loan to the Nixon family, raising questions of influence-peddling that hounded Nixon for years. His White House files show that his obsession with the O\u2019Brien-Hughes relationship never waned. In 1972, O\u2019Brien\u2019s office at the Democratic National Committee would become a target of the Watergate burglars.\u000a\u000aNice morsels. But the true, groundbreaking notes concern the Chennault Affair.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIt is useful to review just how much Nixon feared the disclosure of the Chennault Affair in the fall of 1968. He lied, right from the start, to Johnson\u2014who was trying to keep Nixon, Humphrey and Thieu on board the peace train. \u201cI would never do anything to encourage \u2026 Saigon not to come to the table,\u201d Nixon told LBJ in a conversation captured on the Johnson White House taping system.\u000a\u000aThe denials continued through the years. To his friend and biographer, Jonathan Aitken, Nixon dismissed \u201cthe Chennault canard\u201d and insisted he had not participated in any such plot. In his memoir, RN, Nixon never mentioned Chennault. To David Frost, in their celebrated 1977 televised interviews, Nixon was categorical. \u201cI did nothing to undercut them,\u201d he said of the peace talks. \u201cAs far as Madame Chennault or any number of other people. \u2026 I did not authorize them and I had no knowledge of any contact with the South Vietnamese at that point, urging them not to. \u2026 Because I couldn\u2019t have done that in conscience.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former president had good cause to prevaricate. Nixon\u2019s actions to sabotage the peace talks were, \u201chighly inappropriate, if true\u201d as Kissinger later put it, and in seeming violation of the law that prohibits private citizens from trying to \u201cdefeat the measures of the United States\u201d or otherwise meddle in its diplomacy. As the U.S. code reads:\u000a\u000aAny citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u000a\u000aThough rarely employed over the years, the Logan Act was enacted by the founders to address just such a situation. It is named for George Logan, who conducted private negotiations with the French government during the administration of President John Adams. Logan, a member of the political opposition, used the notoriety to win election to the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000aBy the time Election Day had come and gone, there were far too many interests aware of Chennault\u2019s actions\u2014the White House, the FBI, the South Vietnamese, the Nixon and Humphrey campaigns\u2014to keep a lid on the scandal.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson (right) and Henry A. Kissinger meet at the White House in December 1968, the same week President-elect Richard Nixon announced Kissinger's appointment as his assistant for national security affairs. | AP Photo\u000a\u000aJournalists Drew Pearson, Tom Ottenad, Theodore White, Jules Witcover and Seymour Hersh advanced the story, bit by bit, over the years. So did book-writing Johnson administration officials like Clark Clifford and William Bundy and University of Virginia scholar Ken Hughes, in a 2014 book, Chasing Shadows. Anna Chennault wrote a memoir, divulging some details, as did Bui Diem, the South Vietnamese ambassador to the United States at the time.\u000a\u000aThe biggest break came when trustees at the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library decided to ignore Rostow\u2019s instructions and make public the tapes and files that LBJ had wanted sealed. The 1994 opening of the so-called X-envelope, which included reports of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Chennault, and the 2008 release of the Johnson tapes from the 1968 election season caused a sensation. More recently, the Nixon presidential library, fulfilling open records requests that I and other scholars had made, released an oral history and two long written reports by Nixon White House aide Tom Huston, who had been tasked by Haldeman to collect evidence on the episode for potential use against Johnson.\u000a\u000aIn a February 25, 1970 memo, attached to an 11-page report, Huston warned Haldeman: \u201cThe evidence in the case does not dispel the notion that we were somehow involved in the Chennault Affair and while release of this information would be most embarrassing to President Johnson, it would not be helpful to us either.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat remained, as I started work on a biography of Nixon in 2011, was that one, final and elusive\u2014and most important\u2014piece to the puzzle: evidence of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement. The \u201creturned\u201d White House Special Files provide that proof.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aThe puzzle begins with Anna, the China-born hostess, Nixon campaign fundraiser and grandee of the China lobby. Some called her the Little Flower, others, the Dragon Lady. She lived in a suite at the Watergate apartment building, and was escorted about town by the crafty Thomas \u201cTommy the Cork\u201d Corcoran, who had served in Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s brain trust. As a member of the conservative China lobby, which promoted the interests of the nationalist Chinese against the mainland communists, Chennault was a fixture in Republican circles, and had an official role, organizing women, in the Nixon campaign.\u000a\u000aThough they differed on the details, Chennault and Bui Diem agree that sometime in early or mid-1968, they met secretly with Nixon and Mitchell in New York, and Nixon made it clear to the South Vietnamese ambassador that Chennault could speak on the candidate\u2019s behalf.\u000a\u000aHaldeman\u2019s files show how, in the weeks leading up to the November election, Chennault was in constant contact with the Nixon campaign. One campaign adviser alone\u2014Nixon\u2019s and Mitchell\u2019s law partner Thomas Evans\u2014recorded eight contacts with Chennault from September 30 to October 31, including a luncheon meeting on October 25. In that same period, the FBI tracked her phone calls and visits to the South Vietnamese Embassy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe longer the situation continues, the more we are favored,\u201d Ambassador Diem reported to Saigon. \u201cI am still in contact with the Nixon entourage.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Nixon campaign, meanwhile, had moles at work inside the Johnson administration and its diplomatic ranks. Mitchell had informed the campaign that Kissinger was \u201cfully available,\u201d Haldeman noted, but because of the \u201cdelicate\u201d position he was in as a foreign policy adviser to Johnson and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, didn\u2019t want the news made public. A week later, former CIA Director John McCone and Kissinger (just back from a visit with American peace negotiators in Paris) each alerted Nixon to a potential breakthrough. Kissinger told Mitchell there was \u201ca better than even\u201d chance Johnson would halt the aerial bombardment of North Vietnam by the middle of October. The Harvard professor was leveraging his knowledge for access to Nixon. \u201cK\u2019s really concerned about moves J[ohnson] will take & expects some before election,\u201d Haldeman noted.\u000a\u000aNixon well remembered the 1966 midterm campaign, when Johnson had flown to Manila on the eve of the election for a conference with Asian leaders and announced a new peace plan to sway voters. Now, Nixon feared, Johnson was at it again. Americans\u2019 frustration with the conduct of the war was one of the Republican campaign\u2019s chief assets: News of peace could sap the electorate\u2019s yearning for change. Nixon had agreed to support Johnson\u2019s negotiating strategy, which posed various conditions that North Vietnam needed to meet. Now, he suspected, Johnson was double-crossing him, and selling the country out.\u000a\u000a\u201cRN thnks attempt by LBJ to get pause before election,\u201d Haldeman wrote. \u201cIs attempt to build up idea war is at end.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his notes from October 19, Haldeman gives his first account of the Nixon campaign\u2019s backdoor contacts with the South Vietnamese. Mitchell had conveyed word to Nixon that Thieu was feeling \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from LBJ and that the South Vietnamese wanted the Republicans to take Saigon\u2019s side and determine what the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d would be for their cooperation. \u201cThey propose to hold out long as poss,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aThree days later, Nixon\u2019s longtime friend and adviser, Bryce Harlow, reported from a source in the Johnson White House that a bombing halt was imminent, and would be announced with news of promising peace talks, as part of a plot to boost Humphrey\u2019s chances. Harlow\u2019s report, and signs of Humphrey\u2019s rapidly improving position in the polls, prompted Nixon\u2019s late-night call to Haldeman. His notes end any questions about Nixon\u2019s personal involvement in the scuttling of the peace talks.\u000a\u000a\u201c! Keep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\u201d Haldeman wrote. Further down, anticipating the political boost to Humphrey, Haldeman reported Nixon asking: \u201cAny other way to monkey wrench it? Anything RN can do\u201d as well as Nixon\u2019s order that Woods call her old friend Kung from the China lobby and get him \u201cgoing on the SVN.\u201d Nixon himself reached out to Chiang Kai-shek, the president of nationalist China, informing him that Kung would be conveying an important, personal message from him.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s mind was racing. He ordered Haldeman to contact Charles \u201cBebe\u201d Rebozo, the candidate\u2019s good friend, and tell him that Nixon was \u201cmad as hell.\u201d Rebozo was to call Senator George Smathers, the Democrat from Florida, and \u201chave Smathers threaten J[ohnson]\u201d that \u201cN is going to blast him \u2026 in major speech on VN\u201d should the president use a bombing halt to help Humphrey. And, finally, Nixon told Haldeman to have his vice-presidential candidate, Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland, confront CIA Director Richard Helms about the peace talks. Helms\u2019 hopes of keeping his position in a Nixon administration depended on his cooperation, Agnew was to say. \u201cTell him we want the truth\u2014or he hasn\u2019t got the job,\u201d Nixon said.\u000a\u000aAnother message came in from Saigon on October 31, the day Johnson, in a nationally televised address, announced the bombing halt. Johnson had summoned the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General Creighton Abrams, back to Washington and obtained the general\u2019s personal support for the plan. Chennault conveyed a different report. \u201cD. Lady says Abrams screamed like stuck pig,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aThroughout, Nixon and his aides viewed Johnson\u2019s actions as a crude ploy by the president to help Humphrey. \u201cThey\u2019re selling out SVN\u2014leave new admin to hdle make a communist Asia,\u201d Nixon told Haldeman. They didn\u2019t have access to, or put faith in, the information the Soviets were supplying the White House.\u000a\u000aBut the records from the Johnson presidential library demonstrate that LBJ and his advisers believed they had a viable opportunity to bring an end to the war.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy colleagues and I think\u2014and we have grounds to do so\u2014that complete cessation by the United States of bombing and other acts of war \u2026 could contribute to a breakthrough,\u201d the Soviet premier, Alexei Kosygin, had written Johnson.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Russians are obviously trying very hard to pull this off\u2014and in a hurry,\u201d Rostow told the president on October 22.\u000a\u000aAnd after midnight, on October 28, after leaving a dinner meeting at the White House with Johnson, and conducting a final late-night session with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Rostow composed a heartfelt letter to the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were four people in that room at dinner tonight, aside from yourself, who have lived Vietnam, with all its pain, since January 1961: [Secretary of State Dean] Rusk, [General Maxwell] Taylor, [General Earle] Wheeler and myself. All of us know that, with all its uncertainties, we have the best deal we now can get\u2014vastly better than any we thought we could get since 1961,\u201d Rostow wrote. \u201cIf we go ahead we know it may be tough. But with military and political determination we believe we can make it stick ... None of us would know how to justify delay.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Johnson resolved to take the risk. It was with considerable irritation that he discovered (via banker Alexander Sachs, who lunched with Rostow\u2019s brother Eugene and passed on the latest scuttlebutt from Wall Street insiders) that the Nixon campaign was in league with Saigon and out to wreck the peace plan. Johnson ordered government surveillance of Chennault, the South Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, and Thieu\u2019s offices in Saigon, and his irritation turned to anger.\u000a\u000aOn October 30, the president muttered darkly about Chennault\u2019s activities with Senator Richard Russell, the Democrat from Georgia. The next day, Johnson announced the bombing halt. That night, he was beside himself, raging about Nixon\u2019s actions in a telephone call to Senator Edward Dirksen of Illinois, the Republican leader in the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable. \u2026 We could stop the killing out there,\u201d Johnson insisted. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got this \u2026 new formula put in there\u2014namely, wait on Nixon. And they\u2019re killing four or five hundred every day waiting on Nixon.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe FBI surveillance traced the Little Flower\u2019s activities. \u201cAnna Chennault contacted Vietnam Ambassador Bui Diem,\u201d one report noted, \u201cand advised him that she had received a message from her boss \u2026 which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was \u2026 \u2018Hold on. We are gonna win. \u2026 Please tell your boss to hold on.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aWith such transcripts in hand, Johnson blamed Nixon for strangling a chance for peace. He lashed out at Dirksen.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m reading their hand, Everett,\u201d Johnson told his old friend. \u201cThis is treason.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know,\u201d Dirksen said mournfully.\u000a\u000aDirksen reported the conversation to Harlow, who relayed the gist of it to Haldeman. \u201cLBJ called Dirksen\u2014says he knows Repubs through D. Lady are keeping SVN in present position if this proves true\u2014and persists\u2014he will go to nation & blast Reps & RN. Dirksen very concerned,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s advice to Haldeman was to rally congressional Republicans against the Democrats and \u201ckick them hard \u2026 [saying] this is a political gimmick\u201d that could \u201crisk Am lives w/o any return.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe election was now only a day away. On Monday, November 4, Johnson held a conference call with Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Defense Secretary Clifford to decide if they should make Nixon\u2019s treachery public. But Johnson did not have Haldeman\u2019s notes\u2014or other \u201cabsolute proof,\u201d as Clifford put it, of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement. And Nixon had denied it all in his November 3 phone call with the president.\u000a\u000aRostow had urged Johnson to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d Nixon if the undermining did not stop. But exposing the Republican campaign\u2019s perfidy, on the eve of the November 5 election, meant revealing the Johnson administration\u2019s surveillance of both a wartime ally and the domestic political opposition. The resulting scandal would taint the next presidency and might cause a fatal break with South Vietnam, and neither Johnson nor Humphrey was willing to pay that price. Even Rostow admitted there was then \u201cno hard evidence that Mr. Nixon himself is involved.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson faced a situation like that which confronted President Barack Obama in the summer and fall of 2016, as U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that the Russians had hacked and published Democratic Party emails with the intent of helping Republican Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aWithout proof of Trump\u2019s knowledge or collusion, Obama appears to have made the same decision that Johnson reached in 1968. Releasing such stunning allegations in an election season, without collaboration, would itself be unseemly.\u000a\u000aNixon had taken a great risk, and won. The news of the bombing halt had erased his lead, but his ability to raise doubts about Johnson in the final days allowed him to pull through. He won, in the three-way race, with 43.2 percent of the popular vote. Humphrey received 42.7 percent, and Wallace 13.5 percent.\u000a\u000aNow Nixon was the president-elect, sharing responsibility with the Johnson administration for the outcome of the war. Prodded by Johnson, he changed his tune.\u000a\u000aIn a bracing phone call, Johnson told Nixon that \u201cfolks close to you \u2026 Mrs. Chennault\u201d were telling Thieu to drag his feet. He reminded Nixon of the cost of such intrigue. The delay was \u201ckilling Americans every day,\u201d Johnson told his successor.\u000a\u000aJust as alarming, for Nixon, was the warning from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, reflected in Haldeman\u2019s notes, that LBJ had the bureau tapping phones.\u000a\u000aSo Nixon changed course. He instructed a new go-between, veteran American diplomat Robert Murphy, to inform the South Vietnamese that they should cooperate with Johnson. They must not look, Murphy was to tell Saigon, that they were blocking peace at Nixon\u2019s behest.\u000a\u000aNixon (left) walks with his assistant, H.R. Haldeman, to the White House for a Cabinet meeting in December 1969. | AP Photo\u000a\u000aChennault grew bitter as, in the weeks between the election and Nixon\u2019s inauguration, word of her role leaked to the press, and the men in the incoming administration distanced themselves.\u000a\u000aIn December, 1968 she wrote a long letter to Nixon, asking the president-elect to make her his special adviser on Asian affairs, and gave it to Evans to deliver by hand. A few weeks later, Woods, Nixon\u2019s personal secretary, wrote the transition personnel director, Peter Flanigan, saying that hiring Chennault \u201cwould be a disaster,\u201d and that \u201cthe sooner we can keep her as far away as possible from the administration the better.\u201d\u000a\u000aChennault did not get the job. Several months passed and Nixon adviser Harlow reported her discontent in a private note to Haldeman. \u201cSeems she is being cut up by press etc. for her alleged activities during the campaign involving South Vietnam. Certain aspects of this you and I know; she asserts that everything she did was with the full knowledge of John Mitchell\u201d and other Nixon aides, Harlow wrote. \u201cShe feels forsaken \u2026 as she is subjected to severe criticism for activities which she insists were undertaken at the direct request of the Nixon campaign group.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 1973, Chennault\u2019s friend Tommy Corcoran visited Nixon in the Oval Office. In the conversation, captured on the White House tapes, Corcoran solicited a favor for her, reminding the president how she \u201ckept her mouth shut\u201d on Nixon\u2019s behalf when the press dug into the Chennault Affair. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Nixon said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aWhat was the cost of Nixon\u2019s scheming?\u000a\u000aLooking back in May 1973, as the Watergate scandal exploded in the press, Rostow concluded that the success of the Chennault Affair gave Nixon and his aides a taste for illegal conniving and a false sense of confidence, which led them to their destruction in the Watergate affair.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe election of 1968 proved to be close and there was some reason for those involved on the Republican side to believe their enterprise with the South Vietnamese and Thieu\u2019s recalcitrance may have sufficiently blunted the impact on U.S. politics of the total bombing halt and agreement to negotiate to constitute the margin of victory,\u201d Rostow wrote, in a private memo to his files.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey got away with it,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs the same men faced the election of 1972 there was nothing in their previous experience with an operation of doubtful propriety (or, even, legality) to warn them off; and there were memories of how close an election could get and the possible utility of pressing to the limit\u2014or beyond.\u201d\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s meddling was not the singular element that cost the United States the opportunity to end the war in the fall of 1968, saving tens of thousands of American and Vietnamese lives and four years of excruciating political division at home. The stubbornness displayed by both North and South Vietnam that fall, and in future negotiations, and history\u2019s analysis of the internal political machinations and external pressures at play in Saigon and Hanoi preclude such an easy verdict.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny judgment must be tentative,\u201d wrote the Democratic national security expert William Bundy in his book A Tangled Web, an examination of Nixon\u2019s foreign policy that includes a dissection of the Chennault Affair. \u201cThere is no way to prove beyond doubt that the [Nixon-Chennault] operation was decisive in Saigon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cImmediate and serious peace negotiations might have produced useful concessions. Yet \u2026 complete negotiations would have taken months, and Hanoi might have reverted to a very hard line,\u201d Bundy wrote. \u201cMy conclusion is that probably no great chance was lost.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet Bundy wrote with hindsight. What can also be said is that Nixon\u2019s signals bolstered Thieu\u2019s inclination to drag his feet. In the end, the Chennault episode shut a window that, with the help of the Soviet Union, Johnson and his aides thought they had opened. A moment of genuine hope, and a chance\u2014however slight\u2014to settle this ugly war was stolen.\u000a\u000aBundy raised another troubling issue, with relevance today, as we debate Trump\u2019s potential beholdedness to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Having conspired with Nixon to scuttle Johnson\u2019s peace process, Thieu was in the position to blackmail the new American president. Thieu emerged from the Chennault Affair \u201cconvinced that Nixon owed him a great political debt\u201d and \u201cattached great weight to it throughout\u201d the Nixon years, Bundy concluded. It was \u201cthe most important legacy of the whole episode.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon and Kissinger reached their own peace accord with Hanoi in 1972, Thieu employed much the same stalling tactics he used in 1968 to try and get a better deal. To clinch Thieu\u2019s agreement, Nixon ordered Air Force B-52s to attack North Vietnam in what came to be known as \u201cthe Christmas bombing,\u201d and secretly promised Thieu that the United States would come to Saigon\u2019s aid, with \u201cfull force,\u201d if Hanoi violated the accord. Nixon had obtained no public or congressional support for such a vow, and when the time came to do so, in the spring of 1973, he failed to deliver.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, Saigon fell. By then, Nixon had resigned from office, the last casualty, as he told David Frost, of the war he had prolonged.\u000a\u000aThieu fled his country ahead of the advancing North Vietnamese armies and died in exile in 2001.\u000a\u000aChennault lived on, for many years, at the Watergate. She kept her bruised feelings to herself until the publication of her 1980 memoir, which she entitled: The Education Of Anna.\u000a\u000aJohn A. Farrell is the author of Richard Nixon: The Life.

aVThe race is on to host Europe\u2019s prestigious medicines regulator \u2014 though some countries in the bidding process haven\u2019t ventured far past the starting line.\u000a\u000aEven before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, hopeful future hosts of the European Medicines Agency began their jockeying, just in case. Within months of the surprise vote, almost every EU country declared its intention to be the new home for one of the biggest Brexit prizes once it leaves Canary Wharf in London.\u000a\u000aFast forward to the European Council deadline for formal bids and not every country seems so serious. Some have never visited the agency to learn what its 890 staff need. Some have kept their efforts under wraps. Others have backed out completely. Some never joined the race: the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), Slovenia and Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy bid only for the similarly situated European Banking Authority (EBA).\u000a\u000aMany, however, have rolled out new building proposals and boosted domestic medicines agencies to support the EMA, a vital component of its highly technical work evaluating new drugs. More than 20 percent of that effort is carried out now by the British. Western EU countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark organized events in Brussels to present their bids. By contrast, most Eastern European countries have kept quiet, saving their lobbying power for later in the process.\u000a\u000aMeeting the workers\u000a\u000aAn obvious first step for any country wishing to host, house, educate and provide for hundreds of EMA staff and their families would be a trip to the agency. Employees have no say where they will end up, but meeting the EMA\u2019s executive is an opportunity to find out what it needs to run and make the shift seamless.\u000a\u000aFive of the 23 initial bidders hadn\u2019t visited as of press time, the EMA said.\u000a\u000aOf those that have, Hungary knocked first. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade delegation, minus the health minister, visited in October.\u000a\u000aThe country of 10 million leans heavily on the argument that EU agencies should be better spread across the Union. But Hungary already hosts two EU agencies in Budapest. And the European Council has downgraded the geographical spread as a selection criterion, giving more weight to measures that would permit a smooth transition.\u000a\u000aSome countries have proposed tailored moving services, such as language courses and family support.\u000a\u000aThe Czech Republic visited in December and decided not to bid after getting a look at the operation\u2019s size and scale. \u201cThe Czech Republic can offer better conditions and more suitable capacities for the relocation of the European Banking Authority,\u201d said Ale\u0161 Chmela\u0159, Czech state secretary for European affairs. (The far smaller EBA has 159 staff.) The Czechs have instead lent support for neighboring Slovakia\u2019s EMA bid.\u000a\u000aSome countries have visited more than once, including Austria (three times), Denmark and France, both twice. Health ministers from Spain, France, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Sweden have all visited. Other countries sent delegations on their behalf. Virtually all the visitors left leaflets and information for staff on what life would be like in their new city.\u000a\u000aAt the time of writing, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Germany and Poland hadn\u2019t visited. Germany \u201chas not provided the EMA any material directly\u201d on its bid, health ministry spokesperson Doris Berve-Schucht said.\u000a\u000aFinland said it will visit after submitting a bid. Finland is quietly confident it will stand out from the crowd: It has a \u201cvery precise plan\u201d that includes exact details on how the transition will happen, the candidacy spokesperson said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a very Finnish way of doing it,\u201d the spokesperson added, noting proximity to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki as key to the city\u2019s appeal.\u000a\u000aPoland met Polish nationals working for the EMA at its embassy in London in June, said Marcin Rynkowski, director of the department for international cooperation at the Polish health ministry, who is in charge of the EMA bid. Rynkowski said they plan to set a meeting with EMA boss Guido Rasi in London once they\u2019ve formally applied.\u000a\u000aThe criteria for the new location, adopted by EU leaders in June, factors in flight connectivity from other EU capitals to the new location. That puts places like Cyprus, on the southeastern periphery of the EU, at a disadvantage compared to centrally located, better-connected EU countries. Cyprus didn\u2019t make an official bid announcement after initially expressing interest in becoming the EMA host.\u000a\u000aPrime real estate\u000a\u000aMany bidding countries have proposed tailor-made offices for the agency. Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia have offered large, custom developments. Most plan to start construction by year\u2019s end and finish by March 2019 \u2014 an ambitious timeline.\u000a\u000aThe Dutch bid includes a transitional building option, in case construction isn\u2019t complete when Brexit talks finish, said Kajsa Ollongren, deputy mayor of Amsterdam.\u000a\u000aMalta, while offering \u201cseveral buildings in prime locations\u201d for an immediate transition, would also build customized premises with room for expansion, said Anis Cassar, press officer at the Maltese Permanent Representation to the EU.\u000a\u000aFrance, however, is confident there will be no transition interruptions. Health Minister Agnès Buzyn\u2019s spokesperson said its bid will \u201cguarantee\u201d the EMA will be up and running in its new Lille home by March 30, 2019.\u000a\u000aBuzyn has also visited the EMA twice \u2014 once in June, again in July \u2014 to find out staff needs, especially for the design of its proposed \u201cBiotope\u201d building, conceived specifically for the EMA with health and wellbeing at the core of the design.\u000a\u000aSome cities have buildings ready and waiting. Barcelona has proposed the Torre Glòries skyscraper, formerly known as Torre Agbar, and frequently compared with London\u2019s \u201cGherkin\u201d building.\u000a\u000aItaly has touted the 32-story Pirelli Tower in northeast Milan. While iconic and available, the tower was completed in 1958 and may seem like a step back in time for EMA staffers accustomed to their very new, state-of-the-art home in London.\u000a\u000aAustria has eight available buildings in Vienna, said Philipp Tillich, Austrian health attaché in Brussels. Seven are in the city center.\u000a\u000aGreece, which just officially announced its candidacy July 21, has caught up: It has an official website and has suggested the former building of a Greek tobacco company as the new EMA home.\u000a\u000aGermany and Portugal are hedging their bets; they\u2019ve offered a selection of existing and proposed new developments. It\u2019s unclear who would make the final call on a new office.\u000a\u000aStaff benefits\u000a\u000aSome countries have proposed tailored moving services, such as language courses and family support.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe day after the EU chooses Amsterdam, the Dutch government will open a relocation office to cater to each EMA employee individually,\u201d said Wouter Bos, a former Dutch deputy prime minister and the country\u2019s ambassador for the EMA bid. Portugal is offering a similar service, \u201ca one-stop-shop with liaison officers to help with the staff move.\u201d France would offer a \u201ctailored accompanying pack for staff and their families,\u201d ministry spokespeople said.\u000a\u000aGermany, Ireland, Finland and Denmark have kept these details quiet, saying all will be revealed in their final bids.\u000a\u000aLost expertise\u000a\u000aOne challenge will be compensating for work done by expert staff at the U.K.\u2019s medicines agency. The agency led or co-led 208 human or veterinary drug committees or workshops in 2016. These committees recommend which drugs should be licensed in the EU. Only Germany (195), the Netherlands (168), Sweden (157) and Austria (150) came anywhere close to that volume last year. Croatia participated in one leadership role, Slovakia and Greece in three each and the Czech Republic in 11.\u000a\u000aFor a big EU country, France\u2019s leadership in these committees is relatively low, at 98 in 2016. Of those only 22 were in the major human drug safety committees.\u000a\u000aTo compensate for the loss of British expertise, a handful of countries have already pledged to pick up the slack.\u000a\u000aAustria said it is hiring new people for its medicines agency to take up more workload for the EMA. Similarly, Spain said it has set aside \u20ac3 million to recruit 40 more staff and invest in training at the national agency to take on some of the U.K.\u2019s work.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile the Netherlands, which already rates high in work volume for its size, took a more philanthropic approach, dedicating \u20ac8 million to train staffers of other EU national drug agencies to take some EMA workload from the U.K. It\u2019s investing an additional \u20ac2 million to strengthen its own medicines agency.\u000a\u000aThe lobbying\u000a\u000aThe Council of the EU will decide who gets the EMA in November. It involves a complex multi-stage voting process of up to three rounds. With the added layer of the EBA vote, it will be hard to sew up sooner.\u000a\u000aThat hasn\u2019t prevented rumors from swirling about attempts to do just that. In June, weeks before EU leaders decided on six criteria for evaluating the bids, France\u2019s pitch was thought to be part of a bargaining deal with Germany in which Frankfurt would win the EBA and Lille the EMA.\u000a\u000aAnother tale said the French were involved in a more complex deal. Supposedly, France would support Frankfurt for the EBA and an Eastern European country for the EMA in return for an existing French agency, the European Securities and Markets Authority, being strengthened.\u000a\u000aThe Council strongly denied any pre-voting deals took place, but the rumors only serve to show who is already taking diplomatic lobbying seriously.\u000a\u000aOne diplomat in Brussels said Germany is not lobbying hard for the EMA, since its eyes are set on the EBA. Germany is bidding for both agencies just to have leverage to win the EBA, according to the diplomat. Hungary and Poland also are bidding for both agencies but won\u2019t say which they prefer.\u000a\u000aThe Eastern Europeans, part of the last three waves of EU expansion, lobbied hard behind closed doors with national ministers and ambassadors for an upper hand over countries that already have an EU agency and to keep the European Commission from having a decisive role in assessing countries\u2019 bids. Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Croatia were successful in closed-door lobbying but have disclosed little publicly about their bids.\u000a\u000aSo little that there are very few public details about Budapest\u2019s candidacy despite the looming deadline. The Bulgarian government has made no official announcement, though a few diplomats in Brussels said they were in the game, too.\u000a\u000aThe Council strongly denied any pre-voting deals took place, but the rumors only serve to show who is already taking diplomatic lobbying seriously.\u000a\u000aPortugal hasn\u2019t had time to lobby. Two-and-a-half weeks before the application deadline, it announced it\u2019s offering Porto instead of Lisbon to house the EMA. Despite the country claiming Lisbon was the preferred option for EMA staff (Spain also made this claim about Barcelona.), it swapped cities, but denied this was because of an outcry from officials in Porto.\u000a\u000a\u201cPlacing an agency as important as EMA in a city like Porto would have a strategic impact not only for Portugal but for Europe,\u201d Health Minister Adalberto Campos Fernandes told POLITICO, arguing that a spread of EU institutions and benefits across different cities, and not only capitals, would benefit their development.\u000a\u000aDenmark is making every effort to win over lawmakers and the EMA. It has hosted meetings with virtually all other EU countries about its candidacy, attended at times by Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, spokesperson Katrine Kirch Kirkegaard said. Denmark has also visited the EMA twice, in November and June. In return, the Danish health minister hosted EMA boss Guido Rasi in February this year, and Denmark\u2019s drugs regulator hosted the EMA\u2019s relocation team in April.\u000a\u000aThe lobbying is only expected to intensify ahead of the final decision in November.\u000a\u000aArnau Busquets Guàrdia contributed to this article.

aVBUDAPEST \u2014 For a fledging political movement with its headquarters in a basement, Hungary\u2019s Momentum has already achieved a degree of success by halting an Olympic bid. The next target is Viktor Orbán.\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian prime minister\u2019s grip on power remains firm ahead of an election set for April 2018. Among voters who say they\u2019ve made up their mind already, his Fidesz party regularly tops 50 percent in the polls, around 30 points clear of the far-right Jobbik and even further ahead of the Socialist Party.\u000a\u000aBut the much smaller Momentum thinks it has identified a weakness in the Hungarian leadership: its love of sport. \u201cHungary spends more on professional sport than on higher education,\u201d said Momentum\u2019s leader, 28-year-old András Fekete-Gy\u0151r.\u000a\u000aMomentum made news in early 2017 when it attempted to force a referendum on Budapest\u2019s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. It collected around 266,000 signatures, more than double the number required to trigger a city-wide vote on the plan, by arguing that Hungary wasn\u2019t rich enough to afford the games.\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s response was swift. Orbán pulled the bid, not wanting to risk a repeat of 2014 when a planned tax on internet use led to mass street protests and ended with the only major U-turn of his premiership.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur task is no less than this: building an entrepreneurial, cohesive and modern nation in the Europe of the 21st century\u201d \u2014 Momentum leader András Fekete-Gy\u0151r\u000a\u000aEven now, Orbán acts as though Momentum\u2019s campaign never happened, telling party colleagues in July: \u201cThere is not a big world event that Budapest could not host.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was a boast with some justification from sports fan Orbán: last month\u2019s World Aquatics Championships was held in Hungary.\u000a\u000aLong-term thinking\u000a\u000aThe question now is whether Momentum has any momentum.\u000a\u000aIn local media interviews in the aftermath of the anti-Olympics campaign, Fekete-Gy\u0151r said anything was possible in 2018. He had a more low-key message when speaking to POLITICO in late July, saying \u201cthis party was built for the long term.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said the real goal of Momentum\u2019s 1,100 members \u2014 all of them subject to background checks by an \u201cHR officer\u201d \u2014 is not winning a few seats in the 2018 election, but a bigger transformation of Hungary into a \u201cmodern, digital country \u2026 in the eurozone, at the core of Europe.\u201d\u000a\u000aFekete-Gy\u0151r said he was happy to take his time and accept only the truly committed to the cause. He\u2019s targeting the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian expats in Western Europe, and hoping his compatriots can be persuaded to back a non-traditional party. Momentum believes 80 percent of Hungarians living abroad would return home given the right conditions, without saying how it got to that figure.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to POLITICO in the party\u2019s Budapest headquarters \u2014 a dingy basement \u2014 surrounded by flagons of cheap wine, second-hand furniture and a foosball table, it\u2019s hard to imagine Fekete-Gy\u0151r as the leader of the resistance against a leader as powerful as Orbán.\u000a\u000aYet Orbán himself was an upstart who became one of the Fidesz party\u2019s founders in 1988, at the age of 25. Two years later Fidesz entered parliament with around 5 percent of seats. But by 1998, Orbán was prime minister at the age of 35.\u000a\u000aThere are striking similarities between Fekete-Gy\u0151r and Orbán.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are patriots,\u201d said Fekete-Gy\u0151r, who is also sharp, multilingual and photogenic. Both trained as lawyers but quickly turned to politics. And like Orbán in his early days in politics, Fekete-Gy\u0151r has teamed up with liberals while not fully subscribing to their ideals.\u000a\u000aFekete-Gy\u0151r seems to have other influences. He was clearly trying to show off his inner Emmanuel Macron in his most significant speech, delivered May 1 at a rally in Budapest.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe time has come for those from Kazincbarcika, from Budapest, and from London, the right- and the left-leaning, the Christian and the atheist, the poor and the rich, the young and the old, to recognize our shared national fate, because we have a task. Let\u2019s set aside our animosities, because we\u2019re all patriots, because we\u2019re all valuable constituents of Hungarian nationality, and our task is no less than this: building an entrepreneurial, cohesive and modern nation in the Europe of the 21st century,\u201d Fekete-Gy\u0151r said.\u000a\u000aAside from tone, the main difference between Orbán and Fekete-Gy\u0151r is around 48 percent of support at the polls: Momentum typically polls at 1 to 2 percent nationally and is more popular in the capital than elsewhere in the country. A July poll by the Republikon Institute showed that in Budapest, Momentum enjoys the support of 5 percent of residents, putting it in fifth place.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not much but the Hungarian authorities clearly see Momentum as a threat, with anti-Momentum articles appearing regularly in the government-controlled press.\u000a\u000a\u2018Banal clichés\u2019\u000a\u000aCritics say that Momentum is politically naive.

Balogh, a prolific blogger who opposes Orbán\u2019s government, said that aside from the anti-Olympics campaign, Momentum offers only \u201cbanal clichés\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t got a clue about politics.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also alienated fellow opponents of the Orbán government by rejecting potential alliances with Hungary\u2019s liberal and left-wing opposition parties.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen András Fekete-Gy\u0151r says to the [Swiss newspaper] Neue Zürcher Zeitung that he supports \u2018both gay marriage and border control\u2019 [the border fence erected by Orbán to keep refugees out], he positions his party within the complex status quo \u2014 but with a \u2018new,\u2019 streamlined \u2018hipster patriot\u2019 foundation,\u201d left-wing philosopher and commentator Gáspár Miklós Tamás wrote in a recent critique of the party.\u000a\u000aIstván Heged\u0171s, a former Fidesz MP who left the party in frustration at its populist turn, was more optimistic. He said Momentum is \u201ca very promising pro-European party\u201d but reckoned an electoral breakthrough next year was unlikely given the group\u2019s refusal to cooperate with other parties.\u000a\u000a\u201cMomentum might consider 2022 to be the right timing for grasping power \u2014 unfortunately, the country might not have so much time to preserve the rest of democracy and the rule of law under a radicalizing illiberal, populist Orbán regime,\u201d Heged\u0171s said.\u000a\u000aSport or social services?\u000a\u000aMomentum\u2019s membership contains a large number of young professionals and students, and its focus on problems affecting young, mobile millennials makes it difficult to appeal to other Hungarians, especially older voters in rural areas.\u000a\u000aExpats who don\u2019t live in a country that borders Hungary must go to an embassy to vote \u2014 which drastically reduces turnout.\u000a\u000aBut in one area, its messaging had more of an everyman appeal. Instead of focusing on the government\u2019s treatment of the George Soros-funded Central European University or foreign-funded NGOs \u2014 issues far removed from the daily life of most Hungarians \u2014 Momentum used the Olympic bid as a way to talk about corruption and economic challenges.\u000a\u000aNow it must convince Hungarians to vote for it.\u000a\u000aMany of the party\u2019s core supporters live outside Hungary: and it\u2019s much harder to vote abroad. Expats who don\u2019t live in a country that borders Hungary must go to an embassy to vote \u2014 which drastically reduces turnout. Only about 5,000 out of over 200,000 Hungarians living in the U.K. during the 2014 election registered to vote at the London embassy, for example.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s easier to vote as a dual citizen who has never lived in Hungary than as a Hungarian living abroad,\u201d said Tamas Csillag, the head of the London branch of Momentum.\u000a\u000aMomentum\u2019s solution?

aVPrivatization would not disproportionately hurt the working class. A fully private flood insurance market coupled with a targeted, means-tested subsidy would be much less regressive than the status quo. Short of full privatization, Congress should ensure that private insurers can compete on an even playing field with the NFIP.\u000a\u000aCongress tried to fix the NFIP\u2019s flawed premium structure in 2012. However, most of the changes made were repealed or put on hold two years later. This time around, Congress should focus on measures that would enable the growth of the private flood insurance market. Advances in catastrophic modeling, as well as financial instruments used to hedge risk, make widespread private coverage more commercially viable than ever.\u000a\u000aMarket insurance premiums reflect the real cost of owning a property. Subsidized and inaccurate premiums distort that cost. Often, the NFIP stokes moral hazard by underpricing insurance, encouraging over development in flood-prone areas. In other cases, property owners pay too much.\u000a\u000aNFIP rates are also inaccurate. Covered properties are classified into risk-based categories, and premiums reflect average historical losses within those categories. Such broad aggregation misses property-level nuances that are included in more advanced catastrophe models used by the private sector.\u000a\u000aThe NFIP has serious design flaws. Premiums are not priced to be actuarially sound, meaning they do not reflect covered risk. About 15-20 percent of policyholders receive an explicit subsidy, saving them 60-65 percent on the cost of their premium. Such subsidies are not based on need. The remaining \u201cfull-risk\u201d policies are not actuarially priced either, as they do not include a \u201cloading charge\u201d\u2014something private insurers use to build up reserves for especially costly years. Largely as a result of these deficiencies, the NFIP owes more than $25 billion to the U.S. Treasury.\u000a\u000aAuthorization for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) expires on September 30, 2017, offering policymakers an opportunity to rethink the scheme and bring forward reforms that would allow a private flood insurance market to develop in its place.\u000a\u000aIntroduction\u000a\u000aThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, with the intent of reducing the need for post-disaster federal aid by offering flood insurance and providing mitigation incentives to properties that have significant flood risks. The NFIP holds over five million flood insurance policies\u2014roughly 5 percent of all households in the country\u2014that amount to over $1.2 trillion in coverage. The program collects about $3.5 billion in premium revenue annually.1 It has grown over the past half century, even though no sound economic justification exists for government involvement in flood insurance.\u000a\u000aThe NFIP is currently about $25 billion in debt to the Treasury, because the premiums do not accurately reflect real risk for a sizable fraction of the program\u2019s clientele.2 The inaccurate pricing of risk not only exacerbates short-term losses but also engenders potentially costly long-term risks by obscuring the true cost of building in flood-sensitive areas. Moreover, the NFIP is a fiscally regressive program, with its beneficiaries primarily being wealthy owners of high-value waterfront property in the Southeast.3\u000a\u000aMoral hazard, regressive subsidies, and unnecessary debt, among other problems, have prompted lawmakers to consider reforming the NFIP on several occasions over the past 15 years, but without lasting success. However, the current iteration of the NFIP is set to expire before the end of 2017, and debates around its reauthorization will offer Congress a new opportunity to make important changes. The NFIP\u2019s myriad flaws and costly failures should encourage lawmakers to bring forward measures that would allow a robust private market to flourish in place of government-provided insurance.\u000a\u000aThis policy analysis examines the NFIP\u2019s history, structure, and current problems, as well as the failures of recent reform efforts. It also explores the recent growth of the private market for flood insurance and evaluates the conditions that have enabled that market to emerge. The evidence suggests that, by all salient criteria, a private market is superior to a government-run flood insurance program. Accordingly, this analysis concludes by outlining various steps that Congress could take to encourage the continued growth of a robust and competitive private insurance market.\u000a\u000aA Short History of the National Flood Insurance Program\u000a\u000aFlood insurance came under federal policymakers\u2019 purview as part of a general trend during the mid-20th century of government increasingly serving as a backstop against large-scale public risks.4 A 1934 New Deal provision that offered low-interest federal loans to people affected by natural disasters, including floods, was the first federal policy offering financial compensation to flood victims. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 created a formal system whereby states and localities could petition the federal government for disaster relief.5\u000a\u000aPolicymakers proposed the government provision of flood insurance throughout the 1950s and 1960s. President Harry S. Truman suggested that the federal government act as a reinsurer for private flood insurers to encourage more private flood policy writing. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Federal Flood Insurance Act of 1956, which provided funds for a federal insurance and reinsurance (that is, insuring the insurers) program, but the government never completed the requisite feasibility studies, and no policies were ever underwritten.\u000a\u000aExtensive flooding in the 1960s led Congress to direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a study on constructing and implementing a national flood insurance program.6 The study concluded that, if constructed correctly, a federal flood insurance program could help individuals living in floodplains bear the risk of floods while also encouraging future mitigation efforts, all while discouraging further building in the most flood-prone areas. Congressional drafters designed the NFIP largely according to the HUD report\u2019s core recommendations.7\u000a\u000aSome notable aspects of the current program were not part of that original version. For example, the original program did not require homeowners with government-backed mortgages to buy NFIP insurance if they lived in high-risk areas; Congress added that provision in the 1970s in an attempt to counteract low enrollment.8 And it was the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that initiated the policy of grandfathering properties transferred from lower-risk to higher-risk areas during remapping, rather than charging such homeowners the market price for their insurance.9\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, Congress did not sufficiently appreciate that the limited availability of private flood insurance indicated the steep underlying cost of living in a floodplain. The risk of flood damage served to limit people\u2019s interest in living in or developing flood-prone areas, which Congress should have recognized as a good thing, not a \u201cmarket failure\u201d that government needed to address.\u000a\u000aThe National Flood Insurance Program in a Nutshell\u000a\u000aFEMA bases the prices for NFIP policies on a nationwide system of flood insurance rate maps that mark floodplains and help gauge flood risk. FEMA uses a categorical system to determine the amount of flood risk in a given area, which notes the type of body of water nearby, the elevation, the presence of levees or other mitigating structures, and various other factors material to determining risk.\u000a\u000aNFIP insurance is available to property owners only if their local government decides to participate in the program, which entails its agreeing to the FEMA risk map and accepting floodplain management and a community-wide mitigation standard devised by the agency.10\u000a\u000aFEMA encourages risk mitigation through its community rating system, which allows policyholders located in a community\u2019s higher-risk areas to pay lower rates if that community implements mitigation efforts, such as enforcing strict building codes, enacting zoning rules that limit development in floodplains, and building or improving flood control structures such as dams and levees. FEMA rates communities on the basis of their flood mitigation efforts, and its ratings determine the cost of insurance, with the best communities receiving a nearly 50 percent discount.11\u000a\u000aPremiums and Subsidies\u000a\u000aFEMA designates properties participating in the NFIP that have a 1 percent or greater risk of flooding in a given year as being in special flood hazard areas (SFHAs). Owners of such properties are required to purchase flood insurance if they have a mortgage issued or guaranteed by the government. Lawmakers introduced this mandate to counteract adverse selection problems and to reduce potential free riding on expected post hoc federal aid.\u000a\u000aFEMA cannot deny coverage to anyone who purchases a policy for a property located within an SFHA.12 Owners and renters of property located within a community participating in the NFIP, but outside an SFHA, have the option of purchasing preferred risk policies (PRPs), which receive discounted rates relative to standard NFIP policies based on risk. In contrast to policies written for properties within an SFHA, FEMA can deny coverage to a PRP applicant if the property has a significant history of flood loss.\u000a\u000aAbout 20 percent of all NFIP policies receive an explicit subsidy. By law, FEMA is required to subsidize policies for properties constructed or substantially renovated before 1975, or before the date FEMA published the first rate map for the community that the property is in.13 FEMA refers to this subsidy as the pre-flood insurance risk map, or pre-FIRM, subsidy. The logic behind offering this subsidy was that the owners of properties built before the mitigation incentives of the NFIP took root needed an extra incentive to participate in the program and deserved to be protected from falling property values resulting from the insurance mandate.\u000a\u000aCongress expected these subsidies to be temporary, believing that old properties would gradually be replaced by buildings better designed to withstand flood risk. However, the subsidies have effectively discouraged the replacement of these properties, as well as any mitigation efforts. Premiums for pre-FIRM subsidized policies are just 35 to 40 percent of comparable nonsubsidized rates.14\u000a\u000aFEMA also subsidizes policyholders of properties that are reclassified into a higher risk zone when FEMA issues new maps. An estimated 10-20 percent of all NFIP policies are grandfathered into a lower rate.15\u000a\u000aPolicies that do not receive an explicit subsidy are referred to as \u201cfull-risk policies.\u201d Despite the name, their premiums are not high enough to allow for sufficient profits in years with below-average flood damage to compensate for years with flood damage that is well above average.16\u000a\u000aProblems with the National Flood Insurance Program, and the Potential for Solutions\u000a\u000aThe NFIP is plagued by myriad structural problems. Although some of these problems could theoretically be ameliorated by legislation, the reality is that they are endemic to any government insurance scheme. An objective examination of the NFIP\u2019s problems and their causes shows the importance of a growing private flood insurance market as an alternative to government-run insurance.\u000a\u000aDebt\u000a\u000aThe NFIP is currently $25 billion in debt, which reflects the nonactuarial pricing of the full-risk policies as well as the effects of the pre-FIRM and grandfathering subsidies. The NFIP\u2019s pricing of a full-risk premium does not include a catastrophe loading surcharge, a typical feature of private disaster insurance in which the insurer builds reserves in low-cost years to cover losses in high-cost years. As a result, the NFIP unavoidably accrues massive debt in especially bad years that it cannot repay.17 The NFIP\u2019s current debt burden comes largely from two events\u2014Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The NFIP was nearly solvent before Katrina, but that storm left it with $18 billion of debt. The aftermath of Sandy accounts for most of the rest.18 Figure 1 summarizes the NFIP\u2019s annual net income since 1978.\u000a\u000aIn 2011, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America conducted a study on the difference between NFIP pricing and private flood insurance pricing. It concluded that NFIP coverage is offered at half the standard price of comparable private coverage, on average. Although subsidies account for some of the difference, the study still determined that private insurance would on average be priced about 25 percent higher than an NFIP plan in low-risk areas, where subsidies are minimal.19\u000a\u000aThe NFIP also differs from private insurance companies in that it cannot deny coverage to especially risky properties with histories of repeated extensive flood damage, so long as they are located in an SFHA. These especially risky properties\u2014which FEMA refers to as repetitive loss properties and severe repetitive loss properties\u2014are a significant source of the NFIP\u2019s debt.20 A Government Accountability Office study found that from 1978 to 2004, repetitive and severe repetitive loss properties comprised only 1 percent of all NFIP insured properties, but accounted for 38 percent of all claims paid by the program.21\u000a\u000aFigure 1\u000a\u000aNational Flood Insurance Program Annual Net Income, 1978-2017 (millions of dollars)\u000a\u000aSource: \u201cLoss Dollars Paid by Calendar Year,\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency, https://www.fema.gov/loss-dollarspaid-calendar-year; \u201cEarned Premium, Total by Calendar Year,\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency, https://www.fema.gov/total-earned-premium-calendar-year.\u000a\u000aRegressivity\u000a\u000aWealthier households benefit disproportionately from the reduced average cost of flood insurance brought about by government intervention. Of course, not all NFIP-insured properties are high value, but insured homes are on average more valuable than noninsured homes. Conclusions about the program\u2019s regressive effects are in line with the intuitive proposition that property near water, especially along the coast, is more valuable than property without a water view, on average.22\u000a\u000aTable 1\u000a\u000aMedian Property Values, National Flood Insurance Program vs. All Owner-Occupied\u000a\u000aSource: \u201cValue of Properties in the National Flood Insurance Program,\u201d U.S. Congressional Budget Office, June 2007, p. 6.\u000a\u000aThe increased attention paid to flood risk management policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina provided an impetus for policy researchers to consider the distributional effects of the NFIP. In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published a report containing statistics on the average and median values of properties in the NFIP. The CBO divided properties into four categories: full-risk coastal properties, subsidized coastal properties, full-risk inland properties, and subsidized inland properties. The median value of properties in the NFIP exceeded the median value of an American home across all four categories, as shown in Table 1. Coastal properties with NFIP policies, both with and without explicit subsidies, had a median value roughly $200,000 higher than the median American home. Moreover, the CBO report emphasized that many subsidy recipients own properties with well above average values; 40 percent of coastal properties receiving subsidies were worth more than $500,000 and 12 percent were worth more than $1 million.23\u000a\u000aIn a recent Stanford Law Review article, Omri Ben-Shahar and Kyle Logue argue that the NFIP is regressive because any insurance scheme that cross-subsidizes on the basis of risk exposure will inescapably benefit those who are most exposed to risk\u2014and, in the case of flooding, the disproportionately wealthy residents of coastal areas tend to face the most risk. Comparisons of NFIP premiums with potential private premiums show that NFIP policyholders with the most risk exposure tend to receive the largest subsidy, with 80 percent of explicit subsidy recipients living in counties in the top income quintile.24\u000a\u000aGeographic Redistribution\u000a\u000aSince the premiums of policyholders do not fully support the NFIP, it necessarily entails distributing taxpayer money to coastal areas. A 2010 study published by the Institute for Policy Integrity, which is affiliated with the New York University School of Law, shows that about half of the residential properties covered by the NFIP are located in either Florida or Texas. That study also examined the coverage amount of claims paid per capita since 1978 by state and found that the Gulf Coast in general is disproportionately represented in each metric. As the authors conclude, \u201cThe largest benefit of the program\u2014namely, access to below-market rate coverage\u2014represents a significant shift in resources to the hurricane-vulnerable states along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.\u201d25 Figure 2 shows the 10 states that have received the most money since 1978.\u000a\u000aFigure 2\u000a\u000aStates with the Most Payments Received, 1978-2015 (millions of dollars)\u000a\u000aSource: \u201cClaim Information by State, 1978-Present,\u201d Federal Emergency Management Agency, https://bsa.nfipstat.fema.gov/reports/1040.htm.\u000a\u000aMoral Hazard\u000a\u000aThe clearest evidence of the moral hazard caused by the NFIP is the slower-than-expected rate of demolition and renovation of subsidized pre-FIRM properties. One reason lawmakers enacted the pre-FIRM subsidies was that they expected the properties to be quickly replaced or subjected to mitigation efforts; the 1966 HUD study that motivated the creation of the NFIP predicted that most preexisting properties would be replaced within 25 years of the legislation\u2019s enactment. Contrary to that expectation, the number of existing pre-FIRM flood-prone buildings has declined at a rate of about 1 percent a year since the NFIP was established. More than 3.5 million of those buildings were still in existence at the time of the most recent survey.26 The slow rate of demolition reflects the fact that the availability of subsidized insurance makes pre-FIRM properties more valuable.27\u000a\u000aThe moral hazard engendered by the NFIP also distorts decisions about new building. The NFIP requires participating communities to ensure that all new buildings since the adoption of the insurance program conform to minimum mitigation standards, which has reduced insurance payouts by a considerable sum. However, the underpricing of most flood insurance has still inflated property values and encouraged more building in dangerous areas. Because the NFIP has increased the value of many properties at risk of flood damage without forcing those costs to be fully internalized, it unwittingly increased the real and social costs of flood risk.28\u000a\u000aImprecise Pricing\u000a\u000aIn addition to nonactuarial pricing and explicit, non-need-based subsidies, the NFIP\u2019s premium pricing is maddeningly imprecise. Full-risk rates are set using a formulaic approach that assumes that flood risks in a given risk zone are more or less consistent, and that historical claims data can serve as a good proxy for estimates of future risk. As a result, premium rates for individual policies are less accurate than they would be in an insurance system that used granular data and forward-looking probabilistic modeling.\u000a\u000aTable 2\u000a\u000aNFIP Average Premium Loss vs. Private Market\u000a\u000aSource: Erwann Michel-Kerjan, Jeffrey Czaijowski, and Howard Kunreuther, \u201cCould Flood Insurance Be Privatised in the United States? A Primer,\u201d Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance 40, no. 2 (2014): 17, 18.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, researchers from the Wharton School\u2019s Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes compared the NFIP\u2019s premiums with those yielded by a private-sector model.29 The researchers\u2014Erwann Michel-Kerjan, Jeffrey Czaijowski, and Howard Kunreuther\u2014used comprehensive property-level data from Travis and Galveston Counties in Texas.30 They chose Texas because of the state\u2019s significant exposure to both coastal and riverine flood risk.\u000a\u000aTo calculate standard private-sector premiums, the researchers used a catastrophe model for floods provided by international reinsurer Swiss Re and data provided by the firm CoreLogic.31 Premiums yielded by the catastrophe model differed from the premiums the NFIP charges for two reasons. First, the NFIP gauges risk using only historical data. Solely relying on historical data is a deterministic approach: it assumes that the past is indicative of the future. By contrast, the catastrophe model is stochastic: it accounts for the fact that flood occurrences are random and quantifies risk according to probability of occurrence. Second, the catastrophe model yields individualized results for each single property measured. The NFIP, by contrast, charges the same price per coverage amount for each property within a risk zone. The only factor mediating this generic pricing is the elevation of a property\u2019s base floor.\u000a\u000aThe catastrophe model yields the average annual loss for properties examined by measuring the frequency and severity of flood risk and applying that risk measurement, as stochastically modeled, to the vulnerability (that is, the ability to withstand risk) of each property. Average annual loss represents a pure private insurance premium\u2014the amount a private insurer would charge to cover its risks perfectly, without accounting for \u201cloading.\u201d Loading refers to any additional charge a private insurer might include in a premium beyond expected average annual loss\u2014so as to make a profit, for example, or to pay administrative fees or build a reserve fund. The Wharton researchers compared the pure private premium with the NFIP rates. That allowed for an accurate comparison of price accuracy, as the NFIP does not include a loading charge in its premiums.\u000a\u000aIn both Galveston and Travis Counties, premiums determined by the catastrophe model displayed significantly more variance than the NFIP premiums. In Travis County, the distribution of NFIP premiums somewhat resembles a bell curve, as about 65 percent of premiums cost between $2.50 and $5.51 for a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of coverage. By contrast, the distribution of premiums determined by the catastrophe model is much more even. If anything, the private premium distribution resembles an \u201cinverted bell curve,\u201d as over 35 percent of premiums are priced at less than $2.50, and about 30 percent of premiums are priced over $10. In Travis County, the NFIP undercharged on average in the riskiest zones while overcharging on average in low-risk zones. In Galveston County, the pattern reversed, with the NFIP overcharging the riskiest V zone but undercharging all others.32 The paper\u2019s results are summarized in Table 2.\u000a\u000aThe researchers emphasized that premiums yielded by the catastrophe model displayed a greater variance than the premiums charged by the NFIP for each risk zone, regardless of whether the average catastrophe model premium exceeded or fell below the NFIP average premium for that zone. As they noted, \u201cWe find important elements of cross-subsidization within each of the risk categories where some high-risk properties are actually over-priced and some low-risk properties are underpriced.\u201d33 In essence, the Wharton study shows that the NFIP premiums are less accurate than they could be, and that to an extent it is random whether a policyholder pays too much or too little. It is, of course, seriously problematic that NFIP premiums are much less accurate than today\u2019s technology and insurance methodology allow.\u000a\u000aRecent Reform Efforts\u000a\u000aThe effects of Katrina and Sandy made the long-run unsustainability of the NFIP clear to policymakers and catalyzed discussions of significant reform. Those discussions led to Congress passing a large-scale reform in 2012, but most of the changes made did not last long, being largely repealed just two years later.\u000a\u000aThe 2012 Flood Insurance Reform Act, cosponsored by then Rep. Judy Biggert (R-IL) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), attempted to address the NFIP\u2019s accrual of debt as well as the unintended effects of improperly priced premiums. The legislation enacted a series of premium increases that would end the pre-FIRM and grandfathering subsidies, established an initiative to improve risk mapping, mandated that premiums reflect catastrophic loss probabilities, and contained measures to encourage the development of a primary private market, including allowing residents of SFHAs to meet mandatory purchase requirements through buying private insurance.34\u000a\u000aHowever, a political backlash ensued only one year after enactment, when a first round of premium increases was scheduled to take place. Affected policyholders expressed concerns to their political representatives, and politicians representing coastal areas portrayed the premium increases as disparately affecting working-class Americans with little budgetary flexibility. Industry groups with a stake in maintaining existing property values also applied political pressure.35 As a result, Congress passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act in 2014, which rolled back many of the Biggert-Waters reforms while subjecting others to a delayed implementation contingent on further studies.36\u000a\u000aThe Biggert-Waters backlash demonstrates the applicability of core public choice insights about public policy in modern democratic states to the NFIP. Public choice would say that policy often concentrates benefits on a small, vocal interest group while spreading corresponding costs across society as a whole. The combination of concentrated benefits and diffused costs makes rolling back policy much more difficult than enacting it, as the interest group receiving large benefits is likely to place much more pressure on political representatives than the general citizenry bearing the diffused costs.37\u000a\u000aEssentially, reforming the NFIP so that it operates like an actuarially sound private insurance company entails imposing a large cost on those policyholders receiving highly subsidized insurance while granting only a limited benefit to society at large. A more direct and politically palatable approach to reducing the debt and moral hazard wrought by the NFIP would be to encourage the growth of the private insurance market.\u000a\u000aPrivate-Sector Alternatives\u000a\u000aIn the 1977 article that led to their Nobel Prize in Economics, economists Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott explained that an optimal public policy discretionarily chosen by government officials can result in suboptimal long-term results. If policy is static, then economic agents can adjust their behavior in a way that undermines the longer-term goals of policy. Kydland and Prescott demonstrated their point through a formal (mathematical) model, but they also included a few hypothetical qualitative examples.\u000a\u000aOne of those hypotheticals was government flood policy. Kydland and Prescott described a discretionary government flood policy of restricting new building in a floodplain but also protecting preexisting structures. Such policy would be optimal in the short run, but rational agents would surmise that so long as the government is committed to protecting existing structures now, it will likely come to protect new structures constructed in the future. If the government did not adopt a specific, hard-to-breach rule prohibiting building or restricting the provision of aid in the future, optimal short-run flood policy would actually encourage more building and result in a suboptimal long-term result.38 And, the authors added, that ostensibly hard-to-breach rule would be almost impossible for a government to stick to.\u000a\u000aKydland and Prescott\u2019s hypothetical accurately describes the course of U.S. flood insurance policy. The NFIP has had some success in reducing post hoc federal aid and encouraging the adoption of mitigation technology. But by making the NFIP available to all property owners in flood-prone communities, the government unwittingly encouraged the continued overdevelopment of at-risk areas.39\u000a\u000aTo counteract forward-looking economic agents undermining discretionary government policy, Kydland and Prescott recommended dynamic policy rules that incorporated a fixed feedback mechanism, thus institutionalizing a response to changing future conditions. In the case of flood policy, that sort of dynamism can best be accomplished by private insurance. Private insurers engage in many of the same tasks as government regulators of safety. They measure the probability of harm and gauge the effectiveness of mitigation measures and behavior. They also impose private insurance premiums that function like a Pigouvian tax\u2014that is, a charge that internalizes a negative externality.40 The profit motive of private insurers serves as a dynamic feedback rule, encouraging continued socially optimal risk management.\u000a\u000aThe ideal \u201creform\u201d to the NFIP would be to fully privatize flood insurance. That would be more likely to fix the system in a way that would limit the long-run government liability than any alternative legislative approach. Today, financial innovation and risk modeling technology improvements make broad-scale private insurance more feasible than when the NFIP was adopted. Moreover, concerns about affordability can be addressed more accurately and fairly through a means-tested subsidization program than under the current system.\u000a\u000aNo Justification for Government Flood Insurance\u000a\u000aBefore discussing the practical benefits and feasibility of private insurance, it is worth emphasizing that government should not have become involved in the flood insurance market to begin with.\u000a\u000aThe federal government\u2019s rationale for providing flood insurance stemmed from a belief that limited private-market flood insurance constituted a market failure, as well as from faith in government\u2019s own ability to centrally plan an optimal mix of development and conservation in flood-prone areas. In a 1966 executive order, President Lyndon B. Johnson expressed confidence that a centralized flood management system could \u201cpreclude the uneconomic, hazardous, or unnecessary use of flood plains,\u201d while also \u201creducing future Federal expenditure for flood protection.\u201d41\u000a\u000aThe HUD report that provided a blueprint for the NFIP contained similar thinking. It also expressed the idea that near-universal access to flood insurance for floodplain residents was socially beneficial. The report went on to suggest that it was \u201cunlikely, based on past experience\u201d that a fully private market could provide such access. Government-run insurance would, the report continued, \u201climit future flood damages without hampering future economic development.\u201d If designed correctly, such insurance would \u201cprompt an adjustment in land use to reduce individual and public losses from floods.\u201d42\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the government\u2019s thinking in the late 1960s turned out to be misguided. Limited private flood insurance did not constitute a market failure, and the government\u2019s flood management goals would have been easier to meet if market forces had continued to hold sway. Exposure to flood risk depends on one\u2019s choice of where to live, which means there is no \u201cmarket failure\u201d argument to justify intervention. In economics, market failure refers to instances where a condition inherent in the structure of a market for a given good or service results in an inefficient outcome. Some economists argue that government regulation can competently address the problems brought about by a market failure. Types of market failure include information asymmetry, adverse selection, and public goods.\u000a\u000aNothing, however, is inefficient about insurance being prohibitively expensive in a risky area, especially when viable alternate locations to live or operate a business exist. If anything, the limited availability or expense of insurance before the enactment of the NFIP was a sign of a properly functioning market, which accurately reflected the costs of living in a flood-prone area at that time. The government\u2019s decision to intervene should be understood as a social, rather than economic, policy choice. And by any reasonable social perspective, intervention was a poor choice, as the NFIP has imposed costs on society at large while disproportionately benefiting wealthier Americans.\u000a\u000aMoreover, the federal government does not offer insurance for other natural disaster risks such as wind or earthquake. The disparity between the government\u2019s treatment of tornado risk and its treatment of flood risk is especially telling. Tornadoes are, of course, a natural disaster, and the private market for wind insurance faces similar pitfalls as those for flood: the riskiest properties are uninsurable, individuals facing risks may expect post hoc federal aid or otherwise choose not to buy insurance, and less wealthy people living in risky areas may not be able to afford market-based premiums. In fact, some analysts have confessed their surprise that the government offers flood but not wind insurance, given that areas with tornado risk tend to be in less desirable regions with less wealthy residents than areas with flood risk. What\u2019s more, tornadoes are a more random occurrence.43\u000a\u000aModern financial and geographic modeling technology means that private insurers can profitably offer insurance against most flood risk today. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the private insurance market was deficient in 1968. Just as we would reasonably consider the development of new homebuilding technology as altering the calculus about building in flood-prone areas, so we should also consider the development of insurance technologies as altering the real price of risk.\u000a\u000aGrowth of the Private Market after Biggert-Waters\u000a\u000aPrivate-sector involvement in the flood insurance market increased significantly after Biggert-Waters allowed property owners to meet mandatory insurance requirements with private plans. Along with increasing premiums on subsidized policies, the law encouraged insurance firms to investigate the competitiveness of private alternatives. Results of catastrophic modeling suggest that such alternatives would be competitive.44\u000a\u000aSyndicates of high-profile international insurance companies\u2014including Lloyd\u2019s of London, AIG, Chubb, Allianz, and Berkshire Hathaway\u2014began offering primary insurance in competition with FEMA soon after the law passed.45\u000a\u000aThe results have been encouraging: private insurers have taken not only the least risky properties in the NFIP, as some suggested might happen, but also the riskier coastal properties as well. In some instances, private insurers have even been able to compete with the NFIP on properties eligible for subsidized rates.\u000a\u000aOnly a small number of primary NFIP policyholders have switched to private insurance so far, but leaders of the insurance and reinsurance firms involved in the market have expressed confidence that they can take on most NFIP policies. A 2014 Wall Street Journal article quoted Edward Noonan, CEO of international reinsurer Validus Group, on the capacity for privatization: \u201cThe flood-insurance program [NFIP] shouldn\u2019t exist. . . . The private sector can provide all the capacity required\u2026 . There\u2019s just nothing unique about flood that requires a government program today.\u201d\u000a\u000aA 2016 report by Aon Benfield, a leading global provider of consulting and advisory services to reinsurance firms, dedicated a section to private-sector opportunities in flood insurance, which was aptly titled \u201cFlood Remains a Major Global Growth Opportunity.\u201d Discussing opportunities specifically from U.S. risk held by the government, the report went on to state:\u000a\u000aThe reinsurance market is showing that there is confidence in the analytics to price these risks and to reinsure portfolios of flood risk. This is primarily based on the flood models that are becoming readily available and the confidence in the science underlying these models. There is now an opportunity for insurers to evaluate the flood risk and look to provide coverage for these properties\u2026 . This is an exciting time in the flood risk analysis space and the opportunity for insurers is substantial.46\u000a\u000aIn January 2017, the NFIP made its first significant purchase of private-market reinsurance, for over $1 billion in coverage (which the 2012 Biggert-Waters Act authorized). The interest of global reinsurers in American flood risk will persist if a competitive private market is allowed to develop.47\u000a\u000aRecent congressional testimony by Evan Hecht, CEO of Lloyd\u2019s of London subsidiary The Flood Insurance Agency (TFIA), drove home the promise and potential benefits of large-scale private flood insurance. Hecht noted that a majority of the policies TFIA has underwritten so far qualified for the NFIP\u2019s pre-FIRM subsidies, and that the properties in FEMA\u2019s riskiest zones tend to be easier to insure privately than those with \u201cpreferred risk\u201d policies. Hecht also claimed (without providing evidence) that private insurers offer a better customer service experience than the NFIP, a contention that\u2019s perfectly consistent with people\u2019s experience in other places where the government has competed against private companies.48\u000a\u000aThe 2014 Wharton School research outlined earlier demonstrated that private insurance firms have the technical capacity to price insurance more accurately than the NFIP. A proliferation of private insurance offerings could thus lead to savings for those NFIP homeowners who are currently paying overpriced premiums because of overly broad risk aggregation. The Wharton researchers noted several factors that could discourage private insurers from entering the flood insurance market: possible risk correlation; difficulty in distinguishing flood damage from wind damage, which requires different risk calculations; various regulatory constraints; and logistical difficulties inherent in transitioning from the NFIP to a private market. Nevertheless, those same researchers concluded that the entry of private firms into the market suggested that free enterprise \u201cseemed to have solved some of these issues.\u201d49 A 2014 report from Deloitte emphasized that flood insurance is the largest area for property and casualty insurance growth in the United States, with billions in potential annual premiums, and it stressed that private insurers will be interested in the market so long as the market is profitable and government policy does not hinder fair competition.50\u000a\u000aThat said, given that NFIP insurance is underpriced in aggregate, it is unreasonable to assume that private insurers could offer cheaper premiums for the majority of NFIP policies without a change to the NFIP\u2019s premium structure. Other advantages that private insurers wield relative to the NFIP may allow those insurers to compete even in instances when they cannot win on price, however. First, NFIP coverage is limited in important respects. Residential policyholders can insure only up to $250,000 worth of building contents property, and most personal basement property is not covered under NFIP plans.51 Some policyholders will likely prefer to purchase a comprehensive plan and not worry about gaps in NFIP coverage.\u000a\u000aMoreover, many policyholders would likely prefer to have all property and casualty risk covered under the same policy. All-hazards insurance is common in the United Kingdom, and experts note that insurers would benefit from supplying such policies in the United States.52 All-hazards insurance would solve issues related to discerning whether wind or flood caused a given set of damages. Such issues have led to disputes and litigation between policyholders, the NFIP\u2019s Write Your Own contractors, and private property and casualty insurers.53 It is reasonable to expect that some consumers would prefer to pay a slightly higher premium in exchange for the certainty and convenience stemming from having an all-hazards policy.\u000a\u000aThe surest way to promote the growth of private flood insurance short of completely ending the NFIP would be to couple broad-based premium reform with an active effort to transfer policies to private insurance. The state-run Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, which provides subsidized wind insurance to properties with hurricane risk, transferred about two-thirds of its policies to private insurers from 2012 to 2016 after undertaking these steps.54 However, the inaccuracy of the NFIP\u2019s current pricing system, coupled with the nonprice advantages of private insurance, demonstrates that consumer demand will be strong for private flood insurance even if the NFIP\u2019s distortive premium structure remains intact.\u000a\u000aPrivate Insurance and Financial Innovation\u000a\u000aThe recent success of private flood insurance has been encouraging and gives hope that future gains might be attainable as well. However, the continued success of private flood insurance depends largely on further gains in financial innovation, and that is problematic, at least from a political perspective.\u000a\u000aThe accepted narrative of the financial crisis of 2008-9 was that the complexity of advanced financial products contributed to the depth of the crisis; as a result, regulators of late have cast a wary eye on new innovations in financial markets.55 However, taking such a strict approach to financial innovation is both shortsighted and unfair: it overlooks the very real gains advanced financial instruments have brought to the economy by deepening capital markets and allowing risk to be more widely distributed and hedged against.\u000a\u000aFloods are a challenge for private insurers because of covariant risk (flood damage hits many properties at the same time), and they also have the potential for high-severity losses. A year in which a substantial number of policyholders in a given risk pool all file maximum claims can bankrupt a flood insurer that\u2019s not sufficiently hedged and diversified. For example, Hurricane Andrew bankrupted nine property and casualty insurers with wind or secondary flood exposure.56 In addition to the difficulty in accurately gauging flood risk, scholars have pointed to covariance and the possibility of deep losses as historically limiting the availability of private flood insurance\u2014and thereby providing a rationale for a government-managed program.57\u000a\u000aHowever, today\u2019s advanced, global capital markets have superseded any barriers to private flood insurance stemming from covariant risk. The experience of Hurricane Andrew motivated academics\u2014and then insurance companies\u2014to investigate the possibility of reinsuring through global securities markets. Advanced risk modeling allowed insurance companies to price and issue catastrophe (CAT) bonds, which are a securitized, tradable financial instrument that entitles the owner to interest payments while stipulating that owners must forfeit their principal if losses from a given catastrophe exceed a predetermined value.58 In the past decade, insurers worldwide have issued CAT bonds as reinsurance against catastrophic risks such as terrorism, war, and natural disasters. An active global trading market in CAT bonds developed over the past 15 years; hedge funds are especially attracted to CAT bonds because risks are mostly uncorrelated with traditional financial assets.59\u000a\u000aFigure 3\u000a\u000aGlobal Reinsurance Capital, 2007-2016 (billions of dollars)\u000a\u000aSource: \u201cReinsurance Market Outlook,\u201d Aon Benfield, January 2017, p. 2, http://thoughtleadership.aonbenfield.com/Documents/20170105-ab-analytics-rmo.pdf.\u000a\u000aThe CAT bonds that those insurers issue usually offer protection for multiple severe, catastrophic risks, including winter storms, wildfires, earthquakes, and so on, in addition to floods.60 CAT bonds would play an integral role if private firms were to become the main flood insurers in the United States. Their development is a triumph of private-sector innovation and evidence that, in the words of Wharton\u2019s David Cummins, \u201cgovernment involvement in the market for natural catastrophe insurance should be minimized to avoid crowding-out more efficient private market solutions.\u201d61\u000a\u000aFigure 4\u000a\u000aAlternative Market Reinsurance Capital, 2007-2016 (billions of dollars)\u000a\u000aSource: \u201cInsurance-Linked Securities,\u201d Aon Benfield, September 2016, p. 15, http://thoughtleadership.aonbenfield.com/Documents/20160907-securities-ils-annual-report.pdf.\u000a\u000aCatastrophe bonds, along with other forms of insurance-linked securities (ILS), have increased the capacity for primary insurers to hedge flood risk through the reinsurance market. As Figures 3 and 4 show, ILS have contributed significantly to a rapid expansion in the total amount of global capital dedicated to reinsurance.62 Consulting firm Aon Benfield recently predicted that total ILS capital will continue to grow rapidly, to between $120 billion and $150 billion by 2018. CAT bonds and other ILS are especially advantageous (compared with traditional equity capital) for insuring against low-probability, high-damage events.63 Moreover, the securities markets allow for reinsurers to access new capital much more quickly if a shock drains existing levels. Underwriting cycles have dampened since Hurricane Andrew, the last global shock to occur before the development of CAT bonds and other ILS.64\u000a\u000aPrivate Insurance and Distributional Issues\u000a\u000aA common objection to any reform of the NFIP is that attempts to fix debt and moral hazard issues will punish working-class Americans who cannot afford higher insurance premiums. During the 2014 floor debate over the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, the legislation that rolled back the 2012 premium increases under Biggert-Waters, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) expressed that objection thus: \u201cNow, is this a bailout for rich people? The people in Louisiana who will benefit \u2026 are working people.\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) likewise spoke of \u201cfamilies who could lose their homes due to crushing flood insurance premiums.\u201d65\u000a\u000aAlthough it may be true that some lower-income people benefit from the NFIP, the program, as a whole, is highly regressive. It is worth emphasizing that private insurance, coupled with a means-tested subsidy, would be less regressive than what currently exists under the NFIP. The NFIP\u2019s financial weakness reflects the randomness of the premium structure and is not evidence of any system-wide subsidy for the working class.\u000a\u000aAlthough private insurance might result in higher premium payments on average as a consequence of the need to include a \u201ccatastrophe loading\u201d charge, premiums will more closely reflect real risk. Kunreuther\u2019s study comparing private insurance with NFIP rates in Texas suggests that some policyholders would, in fact, pay lower rates with private insurers, despite the catastrophe loading charge. In other words, both rich and poor homeowners could receive rate cuts.\u000a\u000aMoreover, although subsidized insurance premiums might ease financial burdens for those receiving subsidies, they also exacerbate the collective exposure to risk, which leads to greater damages and a higher cost to taxpayers. If the government is to subsidize the provision of flood insurance, it should be done in a way that maximizes benefits to the truly needy while minimizing costs to society. The NFIP\u2019s rate structure is far from meeting that ideal. Transitioning to a private insurance system with carefully implemented, means-tested subsidies would allow for a more efficient and fairer flood insurance system.66\u000a\u000aConclusion: First Steps toward Reform\u000a\u000aCongress\u2019s decision to create the NFIP in 1968 was not economically or socially justified. This year\u2019s reauthorization deadline should prompt a reconsideration of the program and discussions of reform. The most important initial steps that policymakers can take in reforming the NFIP are those that improve the viability of private insurers and allow them to compete with the NFIP on a level playing field.\u000a\u000aCongress took a major step in 2012 toward normalizing private flood insurance by requiring that federally backed lenders accept private insurance, but legal impediments to private flood insurance penetration remain. Congress can and should address those impediments in conjunction with the September 2017 reauthorization deadline. First, restrictions on coverage terms\u2014as well as criteria that private insurance plans must meet to qualify for the mandatory purchase requirement\u2014should be eased. Currently, private insurance must contain all coverage requirements present in NFIP plans to meet the mandatory purchase requirement. However, that approach overlooks the NFIP\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to policy writing; the greater flexibility of private insurers to tailor coverage to specific characteristics of the properties they insure is a feature, not a bug.\u000a\u000aSecond, statutes governing the NFIP prevent private firms that sell and manage policies through the Write Your Own program from selling competing insurance. Congress should eliminate that noncompete clause. Ideally, in a fully privatized system, private insurers would not have to compete with the government at all. In the transition stage, it is reasonable to expect a robust private market developing parallel to the NFIP (as is the case in, say, the mortgage market). It is therefore imperative that all potential private insurers be given the opportunity to offer insurance\u2014the goal being to create a deeper and more competitive market.\u000a\u000aThird, FEMA should release all historical property-level data related to flood risk to private insurers and modeling companies. Such data are necessary for private insurers to develop the most accurate and precise risk models and to price insurance plans accordingly. As private insurers have a greater incentive and capacity to use historical and scientific data to determine the most accurate and fair premiums, no good reason exists to deny data sharing. Adequate steps can be taken to ensure that any sensitive information on specific individuals is not revealed.\u000a\u000aFourth, Congress should clarify rules on whether mortgage lenders are required to accept surplus lines insurance\u2014that is, insurance purchased from a firm that is not licensed in the policyholder\u2019s state of residence. Usually, surplus lines insurance is purchased when consumers cannot find an insurer licensed in their home state.\u000a\u000aSurplus lines insurance is a significant component of the private flood market. In 2014, the surplus lines market accounted for $126.6 million in premiums from six states that collect data. By comparison, the NFIP collected about $3.5 billion in premiums in 2014.67 As of now, proposed rulemaking designed to clarify the requirement that lenders accept private insurance\u2014issued jointly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Farm Credit Administration, and the National Credit Union Administration\u2014would exclude surplus lines insurance policies that offer narrower coverage than an NFIP policy.68 Congress should explicitly clarify that lenders must accept a surplus lines policy so long as the provider is approved by any state-level regulator.69\u000a\u000aThese measures and any others that encourage a more robust, deep, and penetrating private flood insurance market should be Congress\u2019s priority during the upcoming reauthorization debate. Congress should lay the groundwork for the gradual privatization of the NFIP, as a private system offers the best way of addressing the problems of moral hazard, excessive debt, regressive subsidies, and imprecision that plague our flood insurance system today.\u000a\u000aNotes\u000a\u000aRECENT STUDIES IN THE\u000a\u000aCATO INSTITUTE POLICY ANALYSIS SERIES\u000a\u000a816: Withdrawing From Overseas BasesWhy a Forward-Deployed Military Posture Is Unnecessary, Outdated, and Dangerous by John Glaser (July 18, 2017)\u000a\u000a815.

aVNearly a year on from the referendum that began the U.K. on its journey to the EU exit door, the formal negotiations on the terms of Britain\u2019s departure are due to start Monday morning.\u000a\u000aThe talks will begin \u2014 as the EU27 have demanded \u2014 with discussions about citizens\u2019 rights, the Irish border and the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations (the so-called Brexit bill). But once sufficient progress has been made on those issues they will move into complex territory covering everything from trade and security to planes and fishing.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to the negotiators who will be on either side of the table.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s Brexit negotiating team\u000a\u000aDavid Davis\u000a\u000aPosition: Secretary of state for exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: A true Brexit believer\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Standing down and flighting his own by-election in 2008 in protest at erosion of civil liberties\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 9/10\u000a\u000aThe odds-on favorite to become Conservative leader in 2005, Davis was pipped to the post by a young upstart named David Cameron. By 2016, he had gotten used to his place on the backbenches \u2014 a Tory freethinker and Brexiteer, though not of the head-banging variety. But in a textbook example of how that old wheel can turn, Cameron\u2019s post-referendum demise paved the way for Davis to return to government in the pivotal Brexit secretary role. Underestimated in Brussels but highly-rated by Theresa May, Davis, at 68-years-old, may view Brexit as his last great task in government (though he\u2019s now rumored to fancy a tilt at the top job again). Having argued for it for so long, he has a burning desire to get it right.\u000a\u000aOliver Robbins\u000a\u000aPosition: Prime Minister\u2019s EU adviser, Permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Whitehall wunderkind turned Brexit supremo\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Kicked out of a parliamentary committee hearing for presenting \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d evidence\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aTheresa May\u2019s Brexit sherpa, Robbins has been the U.K.\u2019s central figure behind closed doors ever since he was appointed by David Cameron as personal adviser on the EU in the days immediately after the June 2016 referendum. Robbins kept the role under May, and was also made permanent secretary \u2014 the top official \u2014 in David Davis\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union. Despite his tall and imposing frame, colleagues describe him as a likeable chap, and he has been well-received by his counterparts in Brussels, with whom he has had regular contact in the run-up to negotiations. Having held senior office in the governments of Blair, Brown, Cameron and May, he is the ultimate Brexit \u201cgrown-up.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhilip Rycroft\u000a\u000aPosition: Second permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU)\u000a\u000aReal position: Keeping the United Kingdom together through Brexit\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making transition from working with Europhile Nick Clegg, to delivering Brexit\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 6/10\u000a\u000aOlly Robbins\u2019 right-hand man, responsible for managing the department\u2019s overall policy and legislative program with Robbins expected to spend much of his time in detailed negotiations. He also has a role in the Cabinet Office heading up work on the constitution and devolution, so will be tasked with keeping an eagle eye on how Brexit affects Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A Europe expert who served in the cabinet of Leon Brittan in the European Commission. During the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government he was then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg\u2019s right hand man in the civil service as director general in the DPM\u2019s office. Rycroft also has experience in the private sector as corporate affairs director at Hutchison Whampoa (Europe) Ltd, a multinational company with interests in a range of sectors including ports, energy, hotels and retail.\u000a\u000aTim Barrow\u000a\u000aPosition: U.K. permanent representative to the EU\u000a\u000aReal position: Diplomatic nous\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making headlines with his dog-eared leather briefcase on Article 50 day\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 4/10\u000a\u000aWhat better man to usher in a new age of swashbuckling global Britain than one who looks like he just stepped out of a smoking room in the Colonial Office circa 1875? Barrow took over as the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the EU after the dramatic resignation of the much liked and respected Ivan Rogers in January. The heavily-whiskered Barrow proved a much more manageable lead at the U.K.\u2019s permanent representation, keeping a low profile that will have suited Downing Street just fine, after Rogers\u2019 valedictory diatribe about \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d caused red faces in London. Previously the U.K\u2019.s man in Moscow, where he was a similarly low-key figure, Barrow is a Foreign Office man through and through. Having ably dispatched Theresa May\u2019s Article 50 letter on March 29, he is now expected to play the facilitator in the Brexit talks. However, he is not rated in Brussels, drawing unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, and is not seen as having much influence in No. 10.\u000a\u000aAlex Ellis\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aReal position: International man of mystery\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Debuting at the Foreign Office as part of the team that supported political transition in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aThe effervescent Ellis is a popular man at DExEU, where he is one of two director generals, said to take enjoyment in slipping Brexit soundbites into everyday conversation (\u201cAs a demonstration of our new deep and special partnership \u2026 would you like a cup of tea?\u201d). With top level Brussels experience \u2014 he worked in the office of former Commission President José Manuel Barroso from 2004 to 2007 \u2014 Ellis will bring vital insight into how the old place works. A former history teacher, his career spans South Africa, Portugal and most recently Brazil, where he was the U.K.\u2019s ambassador for three years before taking up the Brexit call.\u000a\u000aSarah Healey\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aHealey is popular among staff in Davis\u2019 department and has a command of detail that would \u2014 and does \u2014 impress even Theresa May. She is a Brexit brainbox who is influential in Whitehall. A high-flyer like Robbins, Healey was brought into the Brexit department in July 2016 having risen through the ranks at the culture, work and pensions and education departments. She began her career in the prime minister\u2019s strategy unit, and has compared the cross-government work on Brexit to the task of putting on the 2012 London Olympics. She is also a quizzing maestro, who as a student won the BBC\u2019s cult quiz show University Challenge and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford.\u000a\u000aSimon Case\u000a\u000aPostition: Director general for the U.K.-EU partnership, U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep)\u000a\u000aHas led the U.K. government\u2019s work on exiting and seeking a new partnership with the European Union within the U.K. Representation to the EU.

He has been at the Treasury since 1995.\u000a\u000aGlyn Williams\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at the Home Office\u000a\u000aA long-time civil servant (starting at the then Department of Trade and Industry in 1985) Williams is now responsible for policy in the U.K.\u2019s Border, Immigration and Citizenship System, including the development of a post-EU exit immigration regime. He also has experience of trade negotiations from his time in Geneva representing the U.K. at World Trade Organisation talks.\u000a\u000aCatherine Webb\u000a\u000aPosition: Director of market access and budget at DExEU\u000a\u000aBefore her current role at DExEU \u2014 responsible for policy on EU market access, goods and budgetary issues \u2014 Webb worked on an EU related portfolio in the Cabinet Office. She joined the civil service in 2000 and held various Treasury positions before taking up the role of economic and trade counselor at the British Embassy in Beijing.\u000a\u000aMark Philip Sedwill\u000a\u000aPosition: National security adviser to the prime minister\u000a\u000aWell known to Theresa May from his time as permanent secretary at the Home Office from February 2013 until April 2017 \u2014 when he was a late addition to the Brexit negotiating team. He joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1989 and since 2009 has served a series of high ranking positions in Afghanistan: including as the prime minister\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u000a\u000aMatt Baugh\u000a\u000aPosition: Head of negotiation coordination unit, DExEu\u000a\u000aThe most influential figure in DExEU that no one has heard of. Heads up the department\u2019s A-team of officials tasked with coordinating all aspects of government policy on Brexit, reporting directly to Robbins. The team was set up by Robbins, raising eyebrows in DExEu. \u201cThis team are the super team. A circle within a circle,\u201d said a government official.

A former European Commission official and trade expert who worked under former Labour Minister and European Commissioner Peter Mandelson in Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe EU27 Brexit negotiating team\u000a\u000aMichel Barnier\u000a\u000aNationality: French\u000a\u000aFormal position: European chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Preserving EU27 unity\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Key to France staging the 1992 Winter Olympics Games in Albertville.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 9/10\u000a\u000aBarnier is the face of the Brexit talks for the EU27. He is officially a top EU civil servant \u2014 a director general in the European Commission \u2014 but Barnier is at heart a politician, meaning it will be very hard for the British team to put one over on him. The center-right pro-Europe Gaullist was elected as a MP in the 1970s. He held several top ministerial positions in France and was twice France\u2019s European commissioner: for regional policy and a decade later for the internal market and financial services. He knows Brussels and the main capitals intimately and has a reputation as a tough negotiator with a clear vision of where his powers and limits are. Some argue that Barnier is more powerful than many commissioners, but he operates within tight guidelines set by the European Council and approved by member countries and so has little room to maneuver.\u000a\u000aSabine Weyand\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: European deputy chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Staying on top of the details\u000a\u000aCareer highlight\u005clowlight: Deputy director general in the Commission\u2019s directorate general for trade.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aWeyand\u2019s experience as deputy at the Commission\u2019s powerful trade policy department will be invaluable in the later stages of the negotiations \u2014 plus her skills nicely complement Barnier\u2019s. In her trade role, Weyand is used to long and complex negotiations so she won\u2019t be fazed by anything the U.K. throws at her. In the official organigram of Barnier\u2019s Brexit taskforce, Weyand has direct oversight of the top staffers in charge of detailed aspects of the talks, from aviation to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill, meaning she will have to be across vast swathes of the detail. The word in Brussels is that Weyand\u2019s real job is to act as an envoy to Martin Selmayr, the Commission president\u2019s chief of staff, so that he can keep an eye on proceedings. Plus her German nationality keeps Barnier\u2019s team from being too French-dominated at the top.\u000a\u000aMartin Selmayr\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of cabinet of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission\u000a\u000aReal position: Feared as the hugely powerful \u201cmonster in the Berlaymont\u201d\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: One of the few top Commission officials who makes headlines with his tweets\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aThe German former lawyer has run the daily operation of the European Commission since October 2014. Selmayr is powerful and he knows it, although he professes not to be. \u201cMy power is nonexistent. It derives only from what the president instructs me,\u201d he said. In reality, in policy areas from migration to the Greek crisis and of course Brexit, Selmayr has been a key actor establishing the Commission\u2019s position. Selmayr will be at the Brexit table representing the Commission \u2014 but even when he\u2019s not he will be there in spirit through Barnier\u2019s deputy, Sabine Weyand.\u000a\u000aDidier Seeuws\u000a\u000aNationality: Belgian\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of the European Council\u2019s Article 50 task force\u000a\u000aReal position: Coordinator in chief\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: He was the spokesman of the former Belgian prime minister and now Brexit coordinator in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aSeeuws, a Belgian diplomat, was appointed just days after the Brexit vote to head the Council\u2019s Article 50 task force in the Council \u2014 ahead of Barnier himself. The Council\u2019s swift move was seen by some Commission top officials as a power-grab. But politically savvy Seeuws was not appointed to compete with Barnier but to do his part in the Council, shuttling between national capitals in order to iron out differences in the talks. Seeuws is not seen as a controversial figure and the diplomat, who worked in the Belgian foreign ministry and the Belgian permanent representation to the EU, is credited with unlocking a deal on the European patent system, an issue that had resisted compromise for 30 years. He is a keen cyclist.\u000a\u000aStéphanie Riso\u000a\u000aNationality: French\u000a\u000aFormal position: Director for strategy, coordination and communication\u000a\u000aReal position: To prevent the U.K. dividing the EU27 side on the Brexit bill\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Former head of unit for the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aRiso was one of the first appointments Barnier made to his team, sending a clear message \u2014 there will be no free-riding and the U.K. must pay what it owes. She has in-depth expertise in EU budget talks and their endless financial and legal implications. The context for those talks is almost impossible because it requires unanimity among the EU countries. Brexit might be light relief by comparison.\u000a\u000aGeorg Riekeles\u000a\u000aPosition: Inter-institutional affairs team leader\u000a\u000aA long-time staffer of Michel Barnier in recent years.

aVPresident Donald Trump failed to quickly condemn the stabbing deaths of two men in Portland, Oregon, who stood up to a man haranguing a teenager believed to be Muslim. | Getty Trump misses opportunity to reassure U.S. Muslims after Portland attack\u000a\u000aFresh off a visit to Saudi Arabia, where he spoke in conciliatory tones about Islam and urged religious unity in the fight against terrorism, President Donald Trump has squandered two major opportunities to fix his broken relationship with Muslims living in America.\u000a\u000aThe president first sent out a statement about the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that insulted many Muslims by focusing extensively on terrorism. Then he failed to quickly condemn the stabbing deaths of two men in Portland, Oregon, who stood up to a man who witnesses said was screaming anti-Muslim insults at two young women, one of whom is believed to be Muslim.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s comments, or slowness to say anything, alarmed the U.S. Muslim community, which has felt under siege since his improbable rise on the 2016 campaign trail. The developments also fueled concerns that Trump is unwilling to denounce white nationalists who have seized upon his presidency to promote their worldview.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president contextualizes Muslims as foreigners and as national security threats, and it seems his hostility toward American Muslims is promoting this narrative of hate that led to the stabbings in Oregon,\u201d said Robert McCaw, a top official with the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cTrump needs to make it clear once and for all that American Muslims are equal citizens and that they also need protection.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment Monday.\u000a\u000aTrump, back home after a swing through the Middle East and Europe, was active on Twitter over the weekend, but it wasn\u2019t until Monday morning that the Republican president tweeted about Friday\u2019s killings in Portland. And that was through his official White House account, which is thought to be handled by an aide, not the personal one Trump often uses himself and which has far more followers.\u000a\u000aMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable. The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them,\u201d read the tweet on the @POTUS Twitter account.\u000a\u000aAccording to various reports , three men intervened in Portland on Friday when they saw a man on a train making racist and otherwise intimidating comments to two young women, one of whom was wearing a headscarf. The suspect, Jeremy Joseph Christian, is alleged to have turned on the defenders with a knife, killing two and wounding the third. Christian is reported to have a history of Nazi and white nationalist sympathies.\u000a\u000aAs Portland grieved , Muslim activists and many of their allies took to social media to vent their frustration over Trump\u2019s long silence. Some noted that Monday was Memorial Day, and that one of the men killed was an Army veteran. Many accused Trump of failing to acknowledge any kind of violence other than the Islamist kind, even as reports indicate that white nationalist activity is growing under Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cCall me crazy but had a Muslim killed two white Christians in Portland I suspect our president would have said something,\u201d commentator Peter Beinart wrote on Twitter.\u000a\u000aVeteran TV anchor Dan Rather took to Facebook to urge Trump to speak up.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis \u2018extremism\u2019 may be of a different type than gets most of your attention, or even the attention in the press. But that doesn't make it any less serious, or deadly. And this kind of \u2018extremism\u2019 is on the rise, especially in the wake of your political ascendency,\u201d Rather wrote .\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s hesitation to talk about Portland reminded many of his muted response to an attack on a mosque in Canada that left six people dead early on in his presidency. The White House said Trump offered condolences to Canada\u2019s prime minister, but the president issued no statement of his own on the attack, nor did he speak publicly of it.\u000a\u000aWhite nationalists and others often affiliated with the so-called alt-right have championed Trump since he began running for office. His campaign-era call for the U.S. to bar Muslims from entry resonated with many in that crowd, as did his attempt once in office to impose a travel ban on people from several majority-Muslim countries.\u000a\u000aTrump has taken some steps in recent weeks to counter claims that he hates Muslims, not least because of his apparent recognition that, on the international front, the United States needs the cooperation of Muslim-majority countries in the global fight against terrorism. His visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met with the leaders of many Muslim-majority countries, was considered an overall success. His speech in particular struck conciliatory tones.\u000a\u000aBut Trump has largely kept his distance from Muslims who live in the United States. The White House, for instance, has yet to say if the president will hold an event to mark Ramadan, something Trump\u2019s recent predecessors have done. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also reported to have declined to host a Ramadan event, breaking with some two decades of tradition at the State Department.\u000a\u000aBoth men issued statements congratulating the world\u2019s Muslims as they began observing Ramadan last week. Trump\u2019s words, however, sparked criticism in the Muslim community because they focused more on fighting terrorism than the traditions normally associated with Ramadan, such as giving to charity.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmerica will always stand with our partners against terrorism and the ideology that fuels it,\u201d Trump said in the written statement. \u201cDuring this month of Ramadan, let us be resolved to spare no measure so that we may ensure that future generations will be free of this scourge and able to worship and commune in peace.\u201d\u000a\u000aRabia Chaudry, a Muslim-American activist, summed up her interpretation of Trump\u2019s statement in the following tweet: \u201cTrump to Muslims on Ramadan: \u2018don't be a terrorist\u2019.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThomas D. Homan, acting Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, speaks during a press briefing at the White House on July 27. | Alex Brandon/AP Justice Department briefing at White House fuels ethics worries Ex-officials question discussion of specific prosecutions in anti-gang drive.\u000a\u000aA briefing a top Justice Department official and top Homeland Security official delivered at the White House Thursday on anti-gang efforts is drawing renewed warnings of blurred ethical lines between the White House and law enforcement.\u000a\u000aPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General Rob Hur and Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Thomas Homan spoke from the press briefing room podium in a previously-unannounced addition to the not-so-regular White House briefing.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aHur and Homan were flanked by some compelling visuals: TV monitors showing images of tattoos belonging to MS-13 gang members, including enough of the face of one alleged gang participant to identify him.\u000a\u000aThe scene troubled several former Justice Department officials, including Hur's predecessor in the Obama administration, Matthew Axelrod. He said the move was particularly unwise at a time when Justice's independence seems to be under challenge by President Donald Trump's extraordinary and sustained public criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000a"Voices from all corners have spoken out this week on why DOJ's independence is critical to maintaining the rule of law. Having a DOJ official brief from the White House podium was an unfortunate decision that sends a distressingly mixed message," said Axelrod, now a partner at the Linklaters law firm.\u000a\u000aDuring the briefing Thursday, Hur and Homan both discussed specific ongoing criminal cases involving alleged gang-related violence, including murders.\u000a\u000a"Earlier this year, members of this clique committed several high-profile murders in El Salvador. The shooter in these murders fled to the United States and is now in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings," Hur said. "The United States law enforcement and federal prosecutors recently targeted members of the same clique operating here in Maryland, charging 16 defendants with racketeering. Murder and attempted murder. The last of whom was sentenced this year to life imprisonment."\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

An additional MS-13 arrest admitted to being complicit in homicides of two juvenile females," Homan said as he decried the violent tactics associated with the gang.\u000a\u000aWhile top Justice Department officials have sometimes appeared at White House events to discuss policy issues in recent years, some ex-officials said it was a mistake for law enforcement officials to be discussing individual cases from a venue like the White House briefing room.\u000a\u000a"The Department of Justice generally goes to great lengths to maintain arms length distance from the White House when it comes to when it comes to specific criminal or investigative matters," said William Yeomans, who worked at the Justice Department from 1978 to 2005. "Having people from DOJ who engage in ongoing operations go to the White House to speak from the podium probably suggests the traditional lines are not being observed."\u000a\u000aYeomans said the presentation would be less troubling if it had taken place at the Justice Department or the Department of Homeland Security.\u000a\u000a"I do think the venue makes a difference," he said. "We are very sensitive about politicizing prosecutions in our democracy. Under rule of law, the worst thing that can happen is that people get prosecuted for political reasons."\u000a\u000aA Justice Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration, Emily Pierce, added: "This is going to give the idea to someone or another that the White House is affecting enforcement in cases which is absolutely beyond the pale and wrong for them to do."\u000a\u000aJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to respond to the criticism Thursday. However, when similar concerns were raised in June, she defended the propriety of Justice Department officials delivering their message at the White House.\u000a\u000a"The Department of Justice is committed to making America safe again through fundamental law enforcement principles and will not hesitate to speak out in any venue about policies that endanger neighborhoods and communities around the country," Flores told NPR.\u000a\u000aSome critics said the presentation was particularly worrisome because it appeared to be part of a deliberate campaign to get Sessions back into Trump's good graces.\u000a\u000aAfter a Fox News interview Wednesday where incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called for a crackdown on leaks, Flores issued a statement heartily endorsing the voluble official's remarks. And much of Hur's statement Thursday seemed aimed at convincing not only the press corps, but also Trump himself, that Sessions is hard at work carrying out Trump's call to erdaciate MS-13 and other violent gangs populated in part by illegal immigrants.\u000a\u000aWhile the briefing was ongoing Thursday afternoon, Trump appeared to join in by tweeting: "Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!"\u000a\u000aEarlier in the day, in an unrelated case, Trump further blurred the lines between the White House and criminal prosecutions by taking to Twitter to argue that the media was not paying enough attention to the recent arrest of an aide to Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla.) The aide, Imran Awan, pled not guilty to a bank fraud charge and is awaiting trial.\u000a\u000aOne danger of such statements is that defense attorneys will jump on them to argue that the case is being pursued for political reasons and that jurors could feel pressure to convict as a result of the president or White House's interest in the case.\u000a\u000aIn the Maryland MS-13 case Hur discussed, several defendants have pending appeals, several others are awaiting sentencing, and at least one remains a fugitive and could face a trial in the future.\u000a\u000a"Obviously, there's the possibility of unfair prejudice there," said Yeomans, who served as chief Judiciary Committee counsel to Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) from 2006 to 2009. "That is why presidents are very reluctant to talk about ongoing criminal matters."\u000a\u000aA Justice Department official said Thursday that Hur was selected to speak because of his personal experience prosecuting gang cases. However, it is a certainty that if Hur's boss\u2014Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2014appeared in the White House briefing room, he would face a flurry of questions about his decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey, and Trump's unusual public attacks on Rosenstein and Sessions.\u000a\u000aIn June, the Justice Department selected another frontline expert\u2014U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber\u2014to speak at the White House podium about the problems allegedly caused by sanctuary city policies.\u000a\u000aSessions himself was a surprise speaker at a White House press briefing in March, where he delivered a similar message about the threat posed by sanctuary cities. He was traveling in El Salvador Thursday and is expected to remain there through Friday, even as Trump travels to New York to speak out about MS-13 violence.\u000a\u000aIn a Fox News interview Thursday, Sessions called the president's criticism "kind of hurtful."\u000a\u000aA Justice Department official said ICE provided the photos for Thursday's briefing. An ICE official who asked not to be named could not identify the people in the photos and disputed that any of the pictures showed anyone's face.\u000a\u000a"The photos did not show faces. The intent was not to disclose identities or even highlight those particular cases, but rather to show gang tattoos among those we\u2019ve encountered, which Mr. Homan mentioned are among the many factors we consider when identifying gang members," said the official.\u000a\u000aWhen White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders took to the podium after Hur and Homan Thursday, she said she hoped senators considering health care legislation would work in the same spirit as those pursuing the gang crackdown.\u000a\u000a"Just like the dedicated men and women of ICE and DOJ who are unquestionably producing results every day in these fights against vicious cartels, Senate Republicans now have an opportunity this evening to deliver on one of our biggest promises to the American people," she said.\u000a\u000aTed Hesson contributed to this post.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVLISBON \u2014 The Portuguese government defended its decision to make a last-minute switch from Lisbon to Porto as its choice as the new host of the European Medicines Agency.\u000a\u000aFor months, Lisbon was the country\u2019s nominee to take the agency, which must leave London after Brexit. But an outcry from the authorities in Porto led Portugal to make an 11th-hour shift in its proposal: The government dropped Lisbon barely two weeks ahead of the July 31 application deadline and announced the northern city would be the country\u2019s candidate instead.\u000a\u000aUntil then, Portugal had pushed its capital city hard, with some success: Lisbon was the preferred choice of EMA staff forced to move out of London because of Brexit, ahead of rivals such as Copenhagen, Milan and Bucharest, according to local media reports. Colorful government pamphlets and brochures boasted that \u201cLisbon welcomes the EMA.\u201d\u000a\u000aPortugal\u2019s health minister vigorously defended the government\u2019s decision to ditch Lisbon\u2019s candidacy in favor of Porto. Health Minister Adalberto Campos Fernandes denied claims that the Socialist government sacrificed Portugal\u2019s best hope of winning the 890-staff agency \u2014 and associated jobs, hotel revenue and related economic boost \u2014 to mollify Porto\u2019s independent mayor Rui Moreira, quell disquiet among Socialist lawmakers from the north, and win northern votes when the country goes to the polls for municipal elections on October 1.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor every one of EMA\u2019s criteria, Lisbon was the best match \u2026 it was a winning bid\u201d \u2014 Teresa Leal Coelho, candidate for Lisbon mayor\u000a\u000a\u201cThe political position has nothing to do with the municipal elections, and there was no pressure from the mayor of Porto or anybody else,\u201d Campos Fernandes said. \u201cThis was a political decision with a strategic nature \u2026 a cool-headed and rational process.\u201d\u000a\u000aCampos Fernandes said the move was intended to boost decentralization across Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a challenge for Europe,\u201d Campos Fernandes said in an interview. \u201cPlacing an agency as important as EMA in a city like Porto would have a strategic impact not only for Portugal but for Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would signal that policies are more favorable toward territorial cohesion, to cohesion among cities, to more balanced and more sustainable development.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet in June, Prime Minister António Costa wrote to Moreira arguing Lisbon was the best choice due to the proximity of Portugal\u2019s national medicines agency, INFARMED, and the presence of two existing European agencies in the capital. Having all three agencies would justify the opening of a European school in Lisbon, Costa said.\u000a\u000aThe government also said Lisbon\u2019s air connections and wide range of hotels made it a natural choice for the relocation. Parliament even declared Lisbon\u2019s candidacy to be in the \u201cnational interest\u201d and on May 11 approved the nomination with a unanimous vote in favor.\u000a\u000aPorto politicians were not happy. Moreira demanded a rethink, adding the battle for the EMA to recent high-profile conflicts with Lisbon over the hosting of next year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest and routes of the national airline TAP that, he claims, neglect his city\u2019s expanding airport.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a centralist argument that we have to combat,\u201d he told the Porto city council.\u000a\u000aThe pressure paid off.\u000a\u000aOn July 13, the government did a U-turn and dropped Lisbon\u2019s bid in favor of Porto.\u000a\u000aAccording to the new government line, Porto and Lisbon share many of the factors that make Portugal an attractive destination for the agency: a balmy climate, safe environment, affordable housing, high quality of life and existing international schools.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Campos Fernandes points out the country\u2019s new EMA host candidate is already home to Portugal\u2019s leading pharmaceutical company BIAL and Health Cluster Portugal \u2014 which groups over 170 entities including R&D institutions, universities, hospitals and health-related companies.\u000a\u000a\u201cEmployment prospects for partners [of EMA staff] are also very important, and this is an area where there are many possibilities, not only in research and development, and education, but also in industry, linked to health,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMoreira was delighted, writing to Costa to applaud a policy reversal he acclaimed as \u201can auspicious foretaste of a new way of governing Portugal\u201d that would overcome the centralism that is \u201cat least partly responsible for Portugal\u2019s structural backwardness.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut placating Moreira is a sign that Portugal\u2019s priorities are out of order, one drug industry representative said.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously the decision to change from Lisbon to Porto could be construed as a decision made with a domestic agenda in mind,\u201d said Brian Cleary, chief marketing officer at pharma consultancy Acorn Regulatory in Ireland. \u201cOn the surface, this might appear to casual observers as disorganization, but we must not underestimate the role that politics has to play in every layer of the EMA decision. This strikes me as a move to assuage Porto rather than a tactical move. Porto has not suddenly developed a considerably enhanced infrastructure.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Cleary added that he never believed the Portuguese had a strong chance of winning the agency, so the late-stage shift may not matter in the long run.\u000a\u000aLisbon politicians are plenty miffed, whatever the agency\u2019s chances are of ultimately ending up in Portugal.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor every one of EMA\u2019s criteria, Lisbon was the best match \u2026 it was a winning bid,\u201d bemoaned Teresa Leal Coelho, candidate for Lisbon mayor from the opposition Social Democratic Party.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe process wasn\u2019t particularly well handled by the government,\u201d Lisbon\u2019s Socialist mayor, Fernando Medina, said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPorto has good conditions to ensure a seamless transition. It will be easy\u201d \u2014 Health Minister Adalberto Campos Fernandes\u000a\u000aCampos Fernandes insists there are several possible locations for the agency in Porto that would meet requirements for a transition without any break in the EMA\u2019s work. They include a former bank headquarters in the center of town and more \u201cintegrated campus\u201d options. A university campus to the north of the city has been mentioned as another possible location for the EMA.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got many options for the location that would meet the EMA\u2019s main concern for continuity,\u201d the minister said. \u201cPorto has good conditions to ensure a seamless transition. It will be easy. I\u2019d say that from one week to another that EMA can carry on its work \u2026 without any type of upset.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe budget for the bid has not yet been fixed, Campos Fernandes said, but media reports say \u20ac90,000 has been earmarked for communications.\u000a\u000aThe minister said the amount already spent promoting the dropped Lisbon bid \u2014 including brochures and a website \u2014 was \u201cmarginal\u201d and much of it could be recouped by adapting material for Porto\u2019s candidacy.\u000a\u000aHelen Collis contributed reporting from London.

aVSenate Republicans spent their last week before a four-week August recess on a series of moves with one main goal: Reining in Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe GOP delivered an unstated declaration of independence from their own Republican president by passing a Russia sanctions bill he resisted, rebuffing his demands they try again on health care after the spectacular implosion of Obamacare repeal, even taking steps to head off any attempt by Trump to fire the special counsel investigating him, Robert Mueller.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s attempts to blame and strong-arm Senate Republicans came amid mounting frustration over his stalled agenda in Congress during what\u2019s typically the most prolific stretch of a new administration.\u000a\u000aIndeed, the breach between the executive and legislative branches appears to be widening, despite their shared party affiliation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking GOP leader, said of the moves to establish more independence from Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Congress assert its authorities under the Constitution and be an equal branch of the government.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans disputed Trump\u2019s Thursday claim that U.S.-Russia relations have frayed, thanks to congressional sanctions that Congress passed overwhelmingly and Trump signed into law, albeit with major reservations. Instead, lawmakers laid blame squarely at the feet of the president\u2019s would-be ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u000a\u000aAnd in another clear signal of distance from the White House, two GOP senators joined Democrats on separate pieces of legislation designed to shield the special counsel \u2014 investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u2014 from any attempt to fire him.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who partnered with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) on the new bill to help Mueller be reinstated if fired by Trump, told POLITICO that the proposal is \u201cone of a number of things I\u2019m looking at to try and seize the opportunity for us to strengthen this institution and reinstate some of the authority it\u2019s conveyed down the street\u201d to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look back over the last 75 years, there have been a number of instances where Congress has conveyed authority to the president because it happened to be their president in the White House,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cIt\u2019s more appropriate to be reserved here on Capitol Hill.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump escalated his combative rhetoric toward Senate Republicans this week, suggesting that they would be \u201ctotal quitters\u201d for ending their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Even after signing a bipartisan package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, Trump blamed Congress in a tweet for pushing relations with Moscow to \u201can all-time and dangerous low.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans rejected both arguments before leaving Washington.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re set to return to the Hill after Labor Day with an array of arduous battles ahead, from raising the federal debt ceiling, to avoiding a government shutdown, to crafting a tax bill \u2014 and perilously few legislative days remaining in the year. Not to mention Trump\u2019s dimming approval ratings, which will only slice into the political capital needed to achieve the ambitious agenda the GOP promised voters.\u000a\u000aSeveral Republicans said Thursday that their assertion of power was nothing more than a continuation of their resistance to Trump\u2019s predecessor.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the Founding Fathers anticipated a tension between the\u201d legislative and executive branches, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said in an interview. \u201cAnd this is the healthy tension. Even if the president is of your own party, there should still be that tension.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) agreed: \u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve been in Congress, and particularly since I\u2019ve been in the Senate, I look for a stronger Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven while absent from the Capitol while receiving treatment for brain cancer, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who dealt the fatal blow to his chamber\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill last week \u2014 took time to blast Trump for criticizing the Russia sanctions bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur relationship with Russia is at a dangerous low,\u201d McCain tweeted. Rather than Congress, he added, \u201cyou can thank Putin for attacking our democracy, invading neighbors & threatening our allies.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is running into Republican obstacles seemingly everywhere he turns these days.\u000a\u000aOn health care, GOP senators have ignored his demands to keep trying to repeal Obamacare, moving on to other priorities, such as confirming key administration nominees and looking ahead to tax reform. If anything happens on Obamacare at the moment, it\u2019ll be bipartisan fixes that will come nowhere close to the promise of repeal that Trump pledged on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aThe president is even threatening to blow up the health care system by cutting off Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies, which help stabilize insurance markets, as a tactic to destroy the 2010 health care law and force Democrats to negotiate.\u000a\u000aNo dice, say key Republican senators.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve recommended that he continue it,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said of the payments. \u201cI hope that he will.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven Trump\u2019s beloved border wall continues to run into resistance from Republicans.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas and three other GOP senators unveiled immigration legislation on Thursday that called for more border enforcement but made clear that a wall sealing off the U.S.-Mexico border was not their preferred route.\u000a\u000aCornyn said in an interview that there is now a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d for Congress to take the lead on policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen on the Russian sanctions bill, sometimes the president will come along, even reluctantly, and we\u2019ll be able to make progress,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cHistorically, it hasn\u2019t always been the case that the president is the one who sets the policy and Congress responds. It was that Congress led. And I think this is the opportunity we have now and I welcome that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVIn Irish folklore, it is believed that disturbing areas with strong connections to fairies can bring bad luck | Flickr via Creative Commons Irish MP blames fairy curse for problems with road Independent lawmaker says there\u2019s \u2018something in these places you shouldn\u2019t touch.\u2019\u000a\u000aA member of the Irish parliament blamed bad luck caused by angry fairies for dips in a road that were repaired and then reappeared.\u000a\u000aDanny Healy-Rae, an independent MP, said the N22 road \u2014 which runs from from Killarney in County Kerry to Cork \u2014 passes through an area that\u2019s rich in fairy folklore. Dips in the road have been repaired but the problems reappeared.\u000a\u000aHe told the Irish Times: \u201cThere are numerous fairy forts in that area. I know that they are linked. Anyone that tampered with them back over the years paid a high price and had bad luck.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked by the paper if he believed in fairies, Healy-Rae said he subscribed to the local belief that \u201cthere was something in these places you shouldn\u2019t touch.\u201d\u000a\u000aHealy-Rae, the owner of a plant hire company, said: \u201cI have a machine standing in the yard right now. And if someone told me to go out and knock a fairy fort or touch it, I would starve first.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Irish folklore, it is believed that disturbing areas with strong connections to fairies can bring bad luck.\u000a\u000aHealy-Rae first raised the issue of fairies at a meeting of Kerry County Council in 2007 after a dip developed in the N22. In a formal motion on the cause of the dip, Healy-Rae a local councillor at the time, asked: \u201cIs it fairies at work?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe council\u2019s road department said the dip was due to an \u201cunderlying subsoil/geotechnical problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVIreland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar delivers a speech in the Great Hall at Queen's University in Belfast | Paul faith/AFP via Getty Images Ireland\u2019s Varadkar says Brexit is the \u2018challenge of our generation\u2019 Irish PM warns that all aspects of life in Northern Ireland will be affected by Brexit.\u000a\u000aIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Friday warned that all aspects of life in Northern Ireland will be affected by Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think perhaps the challenge for our generation is Brexit,\u201d Varadkar said in a speech to students at Queens University in Belfast. \u201cThe Brexit negotiations are now well under way in Brussels. And, to quote [EU Brexit coordinator] Michel Barnier, the clock is now ticking.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prime minister said his government would work with British and EU leaders to protect peace and prosperity across Ireland. But he said people shouldn\u2019t underestimate the challenges relating to citizens\u2019 rights, the U.K.\u2019s financial settlement and issues relating to Ireland.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery single aspect of life in Northern Ireland could be affected by the outcome \u2014 your jobs and your economy, the border, the rights of EU citizens, the rights of cross-border workers, research funding \u2026 trade, agriculture, energy, our fisheries, aviation, EU funding, tourism, public services, the list goes on.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Irish border has become one of the trickiest issues in Brexit negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be no surprise to anyone here that I don\u2019t want there to be an economic border on the island, nor do I want one between Ireland and Britain. And by an economic border, I\u2019m not talking about currency or variations or tax rates. I am talking about a barrier to free trade and commerce.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also had called for a U.K./EU customs union after Brexit, saying: \u201cIf the U.K. doesn\u2019t want to stay in the customs union perhaps there can be an EU/U.K. customs union instead. After all, we have one with Turkey. Surely we can have one with the United Kingdom?\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the U.K. does not want to stay in the single market perhaps it could enter into a deep free-trade agreement with the EU and rejoin EFTA \u2013 of which it was a member prior to accession \u2014 or the European Economic Area. If these things cannot be agreed now, perhaps we can have a long transition period during which the U.K. stays in the single market and the customs union while we work these things out.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Irish prime minister earlier this week said he hopes Brexit doesn\u2019t happen, which prompted Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster to accuse Varadkar of \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the Brexit vote.\u000a\u000aVaradkar said the tragedy of the Brexit debate was falling trust in the European project. He added that he \u201cpassionately believes\u201d being European is an essential part of modern Irish identity. In a recent Eurobarometer survey, Irish people were the most optimistic about the future of the EU.\u000a\u000aHe also said it would be \u201can enormous tragedy\u201d if Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom were cut off from the Erasmus student exchange program.

Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday he has \u201cno idea\u201d why President Donald Trump appears to tweet with particular venom in his direction and that the withering online criticism has only spurred him to remain focused on protecting the integrity of the ongoing Russia investigations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt's really not about me. And I have no idea what is in the president's head,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cBut I can tell you I'm determined not to be distracted. I think they are designed to distract, these bullying tweets.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump lashed out at Blumenthal on Monday in a series of posts to Twitter, labeling the lawmaker a \u201cphony Vietnam con artist\u201d over his past misstatements about his military record. The president\u2019s attacks date back to Blumenthal\u2019s 2010 election, when the former Marine Corps reservist held a news conference to explain that while he had previously stated that he served \u201cin\u201d the Vietnam War, he had in truth served during the war but had not been deployed overseas.\u000a\u000a\u201cNever in U.S. history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie,\u201d said Trump, who received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War. \u201cHe cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child.

aVThe fipronil scandal originated in Belgium, where a company introduced it into a detergent for killing chicken mites | Marcel Kusch/Getty Images Belgium admits test results show harmful level of fipronil in eggs\u000a\u000aAfter days of insisting that Belgian eggs only contained a harmless level of a toxic insecticide, the authorities Tuesday admitted test results revealed a level that would pose a risk to human health.\u000a\u000aThe announcement from the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) came after questions were raised as to why Belgium had declared there to be no public health risk while Germany and the Netherlands expressed concerns over the levels of fipronil in eggs. The scandal originated in Belgium, where a company introduced the poison into a detergent for killing chicken mites.\u000a\u000aAFSCA said that while initial tests from an egg-producing business shut down on July 18 contained fipronil levels of 0.076 mg/kg, a second analysis of the eggs from the same company showed a level of 0.92 mg/kg, which is above the authorized safety level in Europe of 0.72 mg/kg.\u000a\u000a\u201cAFSCA and its laboratories are currently conducting research in order to explain the difference in results and the agency hopes to receive clarifications at the soonest possible moment,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement, adding that the eggs in question had been blocked from shops since July 18 and, therefore, did not pose a risk to consumers.\u000a\u000aA senior health official in Belgium, however, said the company selling the cleaning agent, Poultry Vision, had been using fipronil since January, which meant contaminated eggs could have been consumed by the public since the beginning of the year.

aVThe federal government issues virtually all primary flood insurance for homeowners and businesses, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) owes nearly $25 billion to the U.S. Treasury and taxpayers for covering claims. Beyond this alarming debt, the NFIP cannot keep up with risk assessments and its subsidies actually promote development in flood zones, which worsens the devastation of natural disasters. Congress is now debating reforms to the NFIP. The best course of action is to phase out the deeply flawed program and enable private insurance to replace it.\u000a\u000aBackground on the NFIP\u000a\u000aThe NFIP was established in 1968[REF] to provide flood insurance for at-risk properties and to mitigate flood risks through land-use regulation. Congress noted at the time that ad hoc disaster relief was placing \u201can increasing burden on the nation\u2019s resources,\u201d[REF] which could be alleviated by insurance coverage.\u000a\u000aAuthorization for the NFIP is set to expire on September 30, 2017, and discussion drafts of legislation to renew it are circulating in both the House and the Senate. Unless the NFIP is reauthorized, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the program, will be barred from writing new policies (although existing ones would remain in force).\u000a\u000aCongress last renewed the NFIP in 2012, taking steps to reduce subsidies and base rates on a property\u2019s flood risk\u2014an essential element of viable insurance. However, the congressional \u201cflood caucus\u201d in 2014 successfully reversed many of the reforms at the behest of local politicians and property owners who benefit from the subsidies.[REF]\u000a\u000aTinkering with operational reforms will not remedy the distortionary incentives inherent in a government insurance scheme\u2014especially because the NFIP, as designed, is financially unsound. Problems include:\u000a\u000aWealth redistribution. The use of taxpayer funds to subsidize the lifestyle preferences of a select few who live in or near flood zones is inherently unjust.\u000a\u000aThe use of taxpayer funds to subsidize the lifestyle preferences of a select few who live in or near flood zones is inherently unjust. Dysfunctional pricing . A large proportion of the FEMA risk maps are obsolete, and thus insurance rates do not reflect actual risk.\u000a\u000aA large proportion of the FEMA risk maps are obsolete, and thus insurance rates do not reflect actual risk.

Consequently, NFIP enrollment is skewed to the most flood-prone properties. Uncontrolled costs. More than one-third of premiums are paid to private insurers who sell and service the policies but hold no risk liability. With direct access to the U.S. Treasury, FEMA has little budgetary discipline.\u000a\u000aMore than one-third of premiums are paid to private insurers who sell and service the policies but hold no risk liability. With direct access to the U.S. Treasury, FEMA has little budgetary discipline. Unintended negative consequences. Because property owners do not bear the full cost of flood risk, they are less likely to be dissuaded from locating in flood-prone areas and less likely to undertake preventive measures.\u000a\u000aHow the NFIP Works\u000a\u000aSome five million properties are currently covered under the NFIP. Property owners are eligible if their community adopts and enforces floodplain management regulations that meet or exceed federal standards.[REF]\u000a\u000aFEMA has little discretion in issuing policies, regardless of the degree of flood risk or repetitive claims.[REF] For example, property owners who receive financial assistance from the federal government following a presidentially declared disaster are generally required to maintain flood insurance coverage.\u000a\u000aFor purposes of rate-setting and mitigation planning, FEMA develops Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) of flood-prone communities. Areas in which there is a 1 in 100 or greater risk of annual flooding are designated as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Properties within these areas require flood insurance if the mortgage was issued by a federally regulated lender, a federal agency lender, or a government-sponsored enterprise.[REF]\u000a\u000aNFIP policies have coverage limits:[REF]\u000a\u000aResidential: Structure Coverage: $250,000 Contents Coverage: $100,000\u000a\u000aNon-residential: Structure Coverage: $500,000 Contents Coverage: $500,000\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aProperties that have repeatedly claimed losses are serviced separately by FEMA\u2019s Special Direct Facility. State and local officials are notified when such a designation is made to facilitate community sponsorship of mitigation. Property owners who decline an official mitigation offer are charged higher premiums.\u000a\u000aFor areas with moderate flood risk, the NFIP offers the less expensive Preferred Risk Policies (PRP). Whether they are within a hazard zone or in an area with only moderate risk, policyholders are required to purchase Cost of Compliance policies to cover the added expense of rebuilding to newer stricter construction codes than were originally in place.\u000a\u000aTo be eligible for participation in the NFIP, communities must enact floodplain management standards and regulate development to reduce flood risk. Policyholders may see reductions on insurance premiums if their communities undertake mitigation to improve their status under FEMA\u2019s Community Rating System (CRS). The discount may range from as little as 5 percent to as much as 45 percent based on the degree to which mitigation actions exceed the minimum federal standards.[REF] Federal grants are available for projects that reduce the risk of flood damage to insured structures.[REF]\u000a\u000aUnder the Write Your Own (WYO) program, FEMA contracts with private property and casualty insurers to sell and administer identical flood insurance policies, although they bear none of the risk. Between 2012 and 2016, the insurers received a commission of 15 percent of net written premiums.[REF] Claim adjustment expenses are also reimbursed.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), most of the payments are not reimbursements of actual expenses, but allowances on which the companies can either make a profit or incur a loss. FEMA lacks the information necessary to determine whether its compensation payments are appropriate.[REF]\u000a\u000aUnder the 2012 reauthorization, Congress directed FEMA to develop within one year a methodology for accurate payment of WYO expenses. As of August 12, 2016, however, FEMA had not revised its compensation structure.\u000a\u000aMeasuring Risk\u000a\u000aA confluence of factors determines the risk designation of a property, including:\u000a\u000aElevation of the property,\u000a\u000aBuilding structure,\u000a\u000aDate of construction, and\u000a\u000aCommunity\u2019s flood history.\u000a\u000aThe accuracy of FEMA\u2019s Flood Insurance Rate Maps also varies greatly depending upon the age of the map and the technology used to create it.[REF] FEMA is supposed to re-evaluate all floodplain areas and flood-risk zones at least once every five years, but the agency is unable to keep up\u2014a consequence of budgetary and bureaucratic constraints.[REF]\u000a\u000aFlood studies can take from three years to 10 years. According to a review of the agency\u2019s mapping process by its Technical Mapping Advisory Council:[REF]\u000a\u000a\u201cFEMA continues to utilize the paper cartographic-driven process in constructing FIRMs, which is time consuming and adds expense to the process.\u201d [REF]\u000a\u000aThe unduly prolonged process also \u201cresults in products that are outdated before they are completed.\u201d [REF]\u000a\u000a\u201cIn some cases, pertinent newer data that is developed during the mapping cycle is not incorporated into the final product, and it may be many years before updated information is published.\u201d [REF]\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s monopoly on insurance coverage also politicizes the process of risk mapping, which now involves numerous special interests and various stakeholders.\u000a\u000aThe agency\u2019s inventory of flood hazard maps encompasses more than one million \u201cflood miles.\u201d[REF] (Some analyses indicate that only one-third of the potential miles of floodplain in the nation have been studied and included in FEMA\u2019s inventory.[REF]) However, of the mapping in FEMA\u2019s inventory:\u000a\u000aOnly 49 percent is designated as \u201cvalid,\u201d meaning that the map \u201cadequately identifies the level of flood risk.\u201d [REF]\u000a\u000aAnother 11 percent is designated as \u201cunverified,\u201d which is FEMA-speak for deficient.\u000a\u000aIn addition, 39 percent is \u201cunknown,\u201d as in yet to be validated. [REF]\u000a\u000aIn its review, the Technical Mapping Advisory Council concluded, \u201cMany populations across the Nation are not covered in updated, valid flood studies and are therefore subject to unknown flood risk.\u201d[REF]\u000a\u000aOne of the barriers to accurate mapping is a lack of the data necessary to calculate flood probabilities. In a 2016 review of FEMA\u2019s rate-setting methods, agency staff reported that they began to gather information on water depths in 2010, but still lack enough data to conduct a statistically valid probability assessment.[REF] FEMA staff reported that they will have to gather information over the next five to 10 years before the data allows for a statistically valid assessment.\u000a\u000aAnother hurdle to risk mapping is the cost of obtaining accurate elevation certificates for more than one million properties, which will likely take years and cost several hundred million dollars to obtain if administered through the NFIP.[REF]\u000a\u000aThe accuracy of the risk maps is also undermined by FEMA\u2019s practice of crediting an entire community for a single action that may impact only one structure.[REF] Moreover, once a mitigation action is completed, subsequent actions are essentially ignored.[REF] These practices distort the measurement of risk and thus thwart actuarial rate-setting.\u000a\u000aRates\u000a\u000aNFIP coverage has two types of premiums: \u201cfull-risk\u201d and \u201csubsidized.\u201d\u000a\u000aFull-risk rates are supposed to be actuarially sound, that is, cover anticipated losses and administrative expenses.[REF] According to FEMA, about 80 percent of policyholders pay full-risk rates. However, absent accurate risk mapping, the agency cannot determine a credible full-risk rate. Subsidized premiums, established by Congress to encourage enrollment in the NFIP, apply to properties built before a community\u2019s flood-risk map was issued, or before January 1, 1974. Property owners who have maintained continuous coverage since originally enrolling in the NFIP, or whose property was built in compliance with NFIP standards, have the option of paying a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d premium tied to a previous rate map.[REF] The financial impact of these subsidies on the program is largely unknown because FEMA failed to track grandfathered properties before 2010. However, in congressional testimony earlier this year, Roy E. Wright, FEMA\u2019s deputy associate administrator, said the fiscal solvency of the NFIP depends on setting premiums that accurately reflect flood risk: \u201c[T]he program needs to be on a course to eventually arrive at full risk rates for all policyholders. This includes addressing grandfathered and subsidized rates.\u201d[REF]\u000a\u000aFunding\u000a\u000aNFIP funding is provided by congressional appropriation as well as premiums, fees, and surcharges paid by policyholders. The flood-risk mapping is largely supported by discretionary funds,[REF] while premium revenues cover most program operations and claims.\u000a\u000aUnder its 2012 authorization, the NFIP was granted authority to borrow up to $30.425 billion from the U.S. Treasury\u2014a necessity because the program was designed with subsidies and would not generate the funds necessary to fulfill claims in the event of a major flood.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, after 15 years of lower-than-expected flooding, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma hit the U.S. [REF] To meet damage claims, the NFIP borrowed $17.5 billion from the Treasury.\u000a\u000aTo meet damage claims, the NFIP borrowed $17.5 billion from the Treasury. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, and the NFIP borrowed an additional $6.25 billion.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Hurricane Matthew brought on multiple floods, requiring the NFIP to borrow another $1.6 billion from the Treasury to cover claims and pay interest on the outstanding debt.\u000a\u000aInterest on the debt costs $400 million annually, or about 11 percent of all premium dollars.[REF] To date, the NFIP has paid $2.9 billion of premium revenue to service the debt. FEMA\u2019s Roy E. Wright acknowledged that the subsidies drive the debt, and there is no way to repay it under the current rate structure. \u201cThere is no practical way for us to pay nearly $25 billion in debt. Full stop,\u201d he stated.[REF]\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Congress directed FEMA to establish a reserve fund to offset claim expenses in the event of a disaster that would otherwise deplete the insurance fund. (The assessment is calculated as 15 percent of a total premium.[REF]) In 2014, Congress added a surcharge of $25 for primary residences and $250 for all other properties for deposit in the Reserve Fund.\u000a\u000aFEMA is required by statute to maintain a Reserve Fund balance of 1 percent of the prior year\u2019s total loss exposure. Officials say it could take 20 years or more to reach the balance required by statute. The Reserve Fund was tapped to pay $1.3 billion in claims in 2016. A Federal Policy Fee of $50 is also charged on all new policies and renewals \u201cto defray administrative expenses.\u201d[REF]\u000a\u000aHouse Proposals\u000a\u000aDraft legislation circulating in the House proposes a five-year reauthorization of the NFIP. However, the need for immediate and far-reaching reforms argues for a shorter reauthorization in order to assess the progress of reforms.\u000a\u000aAny reauthorization must avoid entrenching further the dysfunctional elements of the NFIP.\u000a\u000aAmong the reform proposals circulating in the House, a few are worth serious consideration, including:\u000a\u000aEstablish equivalency for private insurance. A market for flood insurance depends upon allowing private coverage to fulfill the mandatory purchase requirements for federally regulated lenders, a federal agency lender, or a government-sponsored enterprise. Public access to flood records and risk ratings is also essential (without personally identifiable information).\u000a\u000aA market for flood insurance depends upon allowing private coverage to fulfill the mandatory purchase requirements for federally regulated lenders, a federal agency lender, or a government-sponsored enterprise.

The NFIP should cease underwriting new coverage for future structures built in Special Flood Hazard Areas four years after enactment. However, this provision should not be made contingent on \u201clocal availability of private flood insurance\u201d or the \u201caffordability\u201d of private coverage. Such caveats would deter property owners from purchasing private policies on the assumption that the NFIP would remain available.

Limit lifetime losses. A small number of \u201crepetitive loss properties\u201d are responsible for a disproportionate share of claims, and limits should be imposed on their coverage. It is reasonable to debate where to set the payment threshold, but waiting until 2021 to impose such a limit is not. It is also unreasonable to make such a limit contingent on the availability of private insurance. The point is that repetitive losses should result in either a substantial redesign of the dwelling or a move to safer ground (although a private insurer should be free to underwrite coverage at their discretion). The NFIP should not grant \u201cprioritized mitigation assistance\u201d or \u201c100 percent cost share\u201d to multiple-loss properties. Doing so would create an incentive to forestall repairs and remodeling.\u000a\u000aA small number of \u201crepetitive loss properties\u201d are responsible for a disproportionate share of claims, and limits should be imposed on their coverage. It is reasonable to debate where to set the payment threshold, but waiting until 2021 to impose such a limit is not.

With more than half of FEMA\u2019s land inventory lacking valid risk assessments, a credible actuarial study would take tens of millions of dollars and years to complete. Likewise, quarterly reports on policyholders would be inaccurate because flood risks are assessed at the community level, not the property level, which does not allow for valid profiles.

Basing premium rates on up-to-date replacement cost, by structure. Most premiums are currently based on the cash value of the structure and its contents, applying national averages. Replacement cost coverage is available for single-family homes. Configuring an accurate replacement cost structure for millions of homes and businesses in the program would increase administrative costs and increase premiums.\u000a\u000aSeveral proposals are particularly flawed given the need for reform, including:\u000a\u000aIncreasing the \u201cAffordability Surcharge.\u201d Rather than require full-risk rates, Congress in 2014 approved a surcharge to compensate for the shortfall in NFIP revenue.

Increases are currently capped at 18 percent annually (and a total premium of $10,000 annually for a single-family property).

FEMA should not be taking any steps toward new types of coverage. Private insurers can customize policies based on demand.\u000a\u000aPrivatization Is the Ultimate Solution\u000a\u000aWhile a few of the proposals circulating in the House would facilitate the availability of private flood insurance, the ultimate solution is to eliminate the subsidies and other giveaways that secure the government\u2019s flood insurance monopoly. Private insurers are interested in underwriting wide swaths of properties in flood zones. The benefits of phasing out the NFIP are reflected in the differences between the government-run program and the private sector.\u000a\u000aThe NFIP has fiscally irrational policy objectives, such as offering subsidized insurance premiums that do not reflect the full risk of flooding to encourage program participation and community-based floodplain management, and reducing the reliance on federal disaster assistance.\u000a\u000aPrivate insurers focus on a different set of objectives. These include ensuring rate and capital adequacy, maintaining solvency, and producing a return on investment.\u000a\u000aThe differences between the NFIP and private insurers apply to rate-setting as well. For example, the NFIP generally accepts all applicants regardless of an individual\u2019s property risk and sets rates across a smaller number of broad rate classes. Private insurers generally insure applicants based on individual property risks and a larger number of more specific rate classes.\u000a\u000aOpponents predict that private insurers will cherry-pick customers, leaving behind property owners with the highest risk. But according to the Reinsurance Association of America,[REF] this fear has not borne out. Two data points in particular show this is not likely to be the case:\u000a\u000aMost private companies in Florida are writing insurance in higher hazard areas and are not choosing the least-risky properties; and Private insurance \u201ctake outs\u201d led to a much smaller and stronger state-run insurance program.\u000a\u000aThe availability of customized options through private companies is likely to increase the number of homeowners who insure against flooding. Such an arrangement would certainly enhance the finances of the NFIP\u2014and unburden taxpayers.\u000a\u000a\u2014Diane Katz is a Senior Research Fellow for Regulatory Policy in the Thomas A.

aVALISO VIEJO, Calif. \u2014 Democrats are increasingly conflicted about how forcefully to press the issue of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u000a\u000aFearful of alienating voters who appear more concerned about the economy and health care, Democrats campaigning in districts across the country are de-emphasizing Russia in their rhetoric \u2014 and some are warning that a persistent focus on the Russia investigation could backfire.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the races where I\u2019m working, I think voters think that Russia is important and that the questions need to get answered,\u201d Bill Burton, a veteran Democratic consultant, said at a political convention this past weekend. \u201cBut they\u2019re mostly sick of hearing about it, and they want to hear politicians talk about things that are more directly important in their lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a state that is critical to the party\u2019s efforts to retake the House, Darry Sragow, a Democratic strategist whose California Target Book handicaps races in California, called Russia a \u201cdistraction\u201d and said Democrats \u201care going to be in deep, deep trouble if they don\u2019t start talking about what voters care about.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to talk about what people think about when they wake up in the morning, and it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Sragow said. \u201cThe more we talk about stuff that voters don\u2019t truly care about in their daily lives \u2026 it confirms that the Democratic Party\u2019s brain has been eaten by the elites in Washington who have been sitting fat and happy for a lot of years while working Americans have lost their jobs and lost confidence in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aPublic polling suggests the electorate is deeply suspicious of President Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia \u2014 but also tired of the months-long inquiry into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. According to a Quinnipiac University Poll released this week, 63 percent of American voters believe Moscow interfered in the 2016 election, and in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll last month, more than half of voters said it was inappropriate for Donald Trump Jr. to meet with an attorney linked to the Russian government.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

An earlier Harvard-Harris Poll found nearly two-thirds of American voters say investigations into Trump and Russia are hurting the country.\u000a\u000aIn that polling, wary Democrats see shades of 1998, when Republicans were widely believed to have overreached on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, losing five House seats in the midterm elections.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously, you don\u2019t know how everything\u2019s going to come out and what cycles we\u2019re going to go through with the independent counsel and the report,\u201d said Mark Penn, the Harvard-Harris Poll\u2019s co-director and former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut if you were to ask me as of today, Democrats are doing a lot better on health care than they\u2019re doing on Russia. \u2026 There\u2019s a risk that they repeat \u201998, that the Republicans create a campaign on issues and [Democrats] get tagged too much with only being about negative arguments.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Russia investigation has proved alluring to Democrats for both the seriousness of the allegations and for the angry response it has provoked from Trump. And for Democrats bidding to unseat Republican incumbents \u2014 even those who have generally supported the investigation \u2014 the various probes have provided a platform on which to yoke Republican House members to Trump.\u000a\u000aBrian Flynn, one of several Democrats challenging Rep. John Faso in New York, said, \u201cThe effect of Russia isn\u2019t people think John Faso is involved in Russia. \u2026 What it is doing is showing the betrayal of the people who put them in office, and that is how we\u2019re using it.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, Flynn said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk a lot about it. \u2026 We\u2019re not going to win on an anti-Trump, anti-corruption approach.\u201d\u000a\u000aHans Keirstead, one of several Democrats challenging Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in California, said Russia \u201cis not the story \u2026 it\u2019s an opener.\u201d Running against Rohrabacher, a fierce defender of Russia on Capitol Hill, Keirstead said, \u201cRussia just shows he is paying attention to things that are not district-focused.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven so, the Russia issue and its near-constant stream of developments remain a staple for many Democrats. On Thursday night, critics of Rep. Michael Burgess confronted the Republican lawmaker on Trump\u2019s Russia ties at a town hall in Texas, while in California, Democrat Doug Applegate took to Twitter to mock GOP Rep. Darrell Issa as \u201cTrump\u2019s lapdog.\u201d\u000a\u000aEarlier this week at a gymnasium in Rohrabacher\u2019s Orange County district, several hundred activists joined in a game of \u201cWho said it? Dana or Putin?\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a room off the gym floor, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu said, \u201cI think it depends what happens with this special counsel investigation. \u2026 No one knows.

But he said voters are \u201cnot attuned\u201d to Russia and that health care is \u201cjust so much more top of mind.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalifornia Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who\u2019s running for governor, was even more direct in a recent appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d The Russia investigation, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything for Democrats at all. \u2026 It\u2019s a loser.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not just the complicated nature of the Russia probes and their distance from many voters\u2019 immediate concerns, that are leading Democrats to question the value of the issue on the campaign trail. Most voters who consider Russia a significant issue will tie the controversy to Trump, not members of Congress, said Colin Rogero, a Washington-based Democratic media consultant.\u000a\u000aAnd unlike on health care, Republican House members believe they have little cause for concern on Russia, with many echoing Trump\u2019s charge that the investigation is \u201cfake news.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDemocrats have forgotten one of the edicts of one of the wise men of their party, Tip O\u2019Neill, who said \u2018all politics is local,\u2019\u201d said Dave Gilliard, a strategist for four of California\u2019s targeted Republicans \u2014 Reps. Jeff Denham, Mimi Walters, Issa and Ed Royce. \u201cRussia is the furthest thing from those voters\u2019 minds. \u2026 If you went out on the street right now and asked 100 people what the most important issue right now is, I would be shocked if one said \u2018Russia.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aKentucky Sen.

Plouffe had previously worked at Uber. Ken Mehlman, who ran President George W.

A spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said: \u201cAs a philanthropic organization focused on a number of substantive issues including science, education, housing, and criminal justice reform, any research efforts we undertake is to support that work.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven though he has said he has no interest in running for office, Zuckerberg\u2019s name \u2014 along with just about every other billionaire or elected official with half the name recognition of a second-tier Donald Trump adviser \u2014 has been floated as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg, 33, stirred the speculation in June when he posted pictures of his road trip through Iowa, the first state to caucus in the primaries, as part of the tech entrepreneur\u2019s yearlong project to visit every U.S. state. He has also toured a Ford assembly plant outside Detroit, a key city in the critical Rust Belt state that Clinton lost to Trump; and Dayton, Ohio, the state long considered an election bellwether.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of you have asked if this challenge means I'm running for public office,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page last May. \u201cI'm not.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven before his is-he-or-isn\u2019t-he road trip, Zuckerberg had shown an interest in politics and social issues.

aVNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, a three-star general who was enlisted by Trump to replace Michael Flynn in February, has been an increasingly volatile presence in the West Wing | Alex Wong/Getty Images Kelly gives McMaster cover in West Wing battles Trump\u2019s national security adviser has emerged as one of the most volatile personalities in White House.\u000a\u000aU.S. National security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has waged a pitched battle with other senior staff for control over policy and personnel on the National Security Council, is taking advantage of the shield offered by the arrival of his old military colleague John Kelly as White House chief of staff.\u000a\u000aKelly told McMaster this week that he wanted him to remain as national security adviser, said two senior White House aides, and has encouraged him to make any staffing changes he deems necessary. McMaster took that as a green light this week to oust top intelligence aide Ezra Cohen-Watnick \u2014 a Michael Flynn hire who has a warm relationship with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law \u2014 after months of trying.\u000a\u000aKelly\u2019s arrival did not lead directly to Cohen-Watnick\u2019s dismissal, officials said, but was months in the making.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, a three-star general who was enlisted by Trump to replace Flynn in February, has been an increasingly volatile presence in the West Wing, operating under a cloud of rumors that Trump, with whom he is said to have a testy relationship, was considering reassigning him to another post, possibly sending him to oversee the war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials who have had direct interaction with him, McMaster has bristled at White House aides close to Trump whom he perceives as undercutting his authority. He seethes over every national security leak and lashes out over negative news stories he thinks are spread by his enemies. And McMaster, whose temper is legendary, frequently blows his top in high-level meetings.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe can be very intense,\u201d a McMaster confidant who speaks with him regularly and is a major supporter, told POLITICO Thursday. \u201cSome find that difficult.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster is fiercely at odds with Steve Bannon, the Trump strategist who was removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council in April after McMaster\u2019s appointment. In mid-July, the two sparred openly, in a widely attended policy meeting about Afghanistan, with McMaster advocating greater U.S. involvement and Bannon arguing for a major pullback.\u000a\u000aThe dispute got so out of hand, according to a pair of senior White House officials, that Secretary of Defense James Mattis had to intervene to get the discussion back on track.\u000a\u000aWhile he has occasionally clashed with Kushner, the influential son-in-law, has a better relationship with him these days, a White House official with direct knowledge said.\u000a\u000aThe officials also said that McMaster fumes that he believes Bannon is responsible for leaking negative information about him to the news media \u2014 including via Breitbart.com, the far-right news site Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign in 2016.\u000a\u000aSeveral of the officials, who like others spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of losing their jobs, said McMaster, who holds a Ph.D. in American history, remains on shaky ground with Trump, who they said wants to keep him \u2014 for now.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for McMaster declined to address questions about McMaster\u2019s relationship with key White House officials and his plans in the days ahead.\u000a\u000aMcMaster has steadily changed the complexion of the top White House policy shop in the past six months, going after people brought into the NSC by Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after failing to be truthful to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.\u000a\u000aOfficials say McMaster had a leading role in pushing out K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News analyst and Reagan administration official who served as Flynn\u2019s deputy and has been nominated to be ambassador to Singapore. He ousted the top Middle East adviser, an Iran hawk, replacing him with a retired Army colonel and military academic. Another top aide was dismissed after penning a memo that accused globalists, bankers and the \u201cdeep state\u201d of undermining Trump \u2014 somethingMcMaster saw as trafficking in conspiracy theories.\u000a\u000aHis assault on those whom some have derided as \u201cFlynnstones\u201d reached its pinnacle on Wednesday when he removed Cohen-Watnick. He had been trying to push him out at least since March, when it was alleged in some reports that without authorization he shared classified information with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who at the time was leading the House investigation of potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Other reported accounts disputed that Cohen-Watnick shared the information with Nunes.\u000a\u000aYet for at least a few weeks, Kushner and others close to Cohen-Watnick have tried to land him a different job, knowing his days at the NSC were probably numbered.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, several of the officials related, was overruled by Kushner and Bannon when he first sought to fire Cohen-Watnick, and he seethed about his inability to get rid of Cohen-Watnick when an article appeared in the Atlantic last month titled \u201cThe Man McMaster Couldn\u2019t Fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster has prevailed in some fierce policy fights \u2014 part of a broader battle between Trump administration officials with a more establishment and internationalist worldview, like Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 to prevail over the more nationalist vision espoused by Bannon and Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka.\u000a\u000aMcMaster has achieved some big victories, like preventing Trump from using the controversial phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d that Flynn insisted upon and getting the president to explicitly endorse the NATO charter\u2019s Article 5 \u2014 which commits the United States to the defend its European allies \u2014 after sending mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to the alliance.\u000a\u000aBut McMaster was excluded from Trump\u2019s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month at the G20 summit in Germany, has failed to convince Trump to send more troops to Afghanistan, and was barely able to keep the president from ditching the Obama-era deal with Iran to halt its nuclear weapons program.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a split in the White House between the Bannon camp of ideologues and the McMaster-Mattis-Tillerson camp of more centrist intellectuals,\u201d said Pete Mansoor, a retired Army colonel who worked closely with McMaster and now teaches at Ohio State University. \u201cAnd this conflict is playing out in real time as the Trump administration tries to flesh out its foreign policy and national security policy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe centrists appear to be winning the battle,\u201d Mansoor added. \u201cBut not always.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite what he has accomplished, McMaster is clearly still very much under fire.\u000a\u000aHe is accused by his detractors of trying to undercut the president\u2019s agenda and has been the subject of a series of negative news stories that he blames on his enemies in the West Wing \u2014 especially Bannon, who people close to him say he believes was behind a recent string of stories on Breitbart that accuse him, among other things, of being anti-Israel.\u000a\u000aBefore his White House arrival, McMaster was a darling of the media. His best-selling 1997 book, an indictment of the joint chiefs of staff during the early years of the Vietnam War, gained him a reputation as one of the Army\u2019s leading thinkers.\u000a\u000aHis later exploits as commander of an armored cavalry regiment near the Syrian border in 2006 formed the building blocks of the counterinsurgency strategy that underpinned the surge of American forces a year later to tamp down a sectarian war \u2014 and earned him public accolades from President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aBut in spite of all that \u2014 or because of it \u2014 he had his share of detractors inside the ranks. As an iconoclast he rubbed many of the top generals, who also saw him as a publicity hound, the wrong way. It is unlikely he would have ever been promoted to general had it not been for a mentor named David Petraeus, the most accomplished general of his generation and another leading \u201cwarrior-intellectual.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the White House, McMaster finds the fierce public scrutiny grating, according several of his close supporters, including articles that have suggested he sullied his reputation by agreeing to work for Trump in the first place and for defending him publicly \u2014 particularly when he went to bat for his boss after reports that Trump shared classified information with visiting Russian officials in the Oval Office.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how much of H.R.\u2019s reported troubles are real and how much are just crafted by his enemies inside the White House,\u201d said Douglas Ollivant, a retired Army officer who served with McMaster in Iraq and is now a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know what reality is.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother salvo was launched at McMaster on Thursday, after the Washington Post published embarrassing transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico, citing the National Security Council.\u000a\u000aA conservative activist group immediately called for his ouster.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are in charge of something and can\u2019t keep control of your own staff, you lose your job,\u201d said Rick Manning, a former official in the Bush administration and now president of the nonpartisan Americans for Limited Government, which blasted out a news release calling on Trump to fire his national security adviser. \u201cHe has lost control of the national security apparatus.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut McMaster\u2019s supporters are certainly not counting him out yet and said his approach may ultimately win over who counts the most: Trump, who admires his hard-charging but thorough approach.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe does respect those who produce at the end of the day and come in with a well thought-out plan,\u201d said the confidant. \u201cMcMaster knows how to run a rigorous process. He seriously wants America to achieve its objectives and to provide the president thoroughly developed, integrated policy options.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 Non-British employees who opt to leave the two EU agencies relocating from London because of Brexit are set to miss out on financial settlements worth potentially tens of thousands of pounds.\u000a\u000aStaff from the 27 countries remaining in the EU who do not wish to move from London with their agency will be forced to resign, meaning that they miss out on the severance payments. British workers, on the other hand, will have their contracts terminated, meaning they can receive the payments, which are intended to cover a period of unemployment.\u000a\u000aThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA), with their 890 and 184 staff respectively, will leave their current homes in London\u2019s Canary Wharf in March 2019. The end of July was the deadline for cities across the EU to submit bids to the European Commission to host the prestigious agencies. The final decision on a new location will be taken in November.\u000a\u000aThe staff have no say in where they end up, so many are biding their time and will only make a decision about whether to relocate with their agency once they know which European city will be its new host.\u000a\u000aAccording to documents seen by POLITICO, the agency warned that 75 percent of employees could quit.\u000a\u000aUnder current rules, U.K. employees of the agencies would have their contracts terminated because EU staff must be a national of a member country unless the agency employing them makes a specific exception. Meanwhile, employees from the countries remaining in the EU who do not wish to relocate will have to resign, meaning that they forfeit generous benefits.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe staff representatives will follow closely all the consequences of Brexit for staff \u2026 and we will endeavor to mitigate the negative consequences,\u201d said Félix Géradon, deputy secretary-general of Union Syndicale Bruxelles, the largest EU staff union.\u000a\u000aAccording to the 2017 EBA expenditure report, 134 of the agency\u2019s staff are temporary, 33 are on full-time contracts and 17 are seconded national experts. Just 12 of the staff are U.K. citizens according to the EBA annual report. The EMA\u2019s annual report says in 2016 they had 587 temporary staff, and 143 contract staff. It employs around 60 U.K. nationals.\u000a\u000aAt stake are severance benefits for staff whose contracts are terminated. These benefits cover up to three years after leaving the agency during which a former employee is out of work. (They lose the benefit if they find another job.) In the first year, the benefits are worth 60 percent of their basic salary, falling to 45 percent in the second year and 30 percent in the third year.\u000a\u000aMost EBA staff are on the EU\u2019s so-called AD7 pay grade, meaning they earn a basic salary of \u20ac5,568.11 per month, so a terminated employee can claim over \u20ac90,000 in possible unemployment benefits over the three years if they do not find another job.\u000a\u000aBudapest precedent\u000a\u000aThere is a precedent for an agency relocation \u2014 in 2013, the EU decided to move its EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) from Bramshill, west of London, to a new base in Budapest. CEPOL\u2019s director Ferenc Banfi at the time said all staff were expected to take up duties at the new location, and that \u201cnon-compliance with this instruction would be considered as resignation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe decision prompted a series of legal challenges from staff. One of these cases was dismissed by the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, others are still pending and two were settled out of court.\u000a\u000aAccording to a spokeswoman for the EMA, staff measures as a result of Brexit will be shaped by the employment regulations, as well as consultation with the European Commission, and \u201cpast experience of other agencies relocating within the EU will also be taken into account.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said measures would be finalized once the decision on a future seat is taken. According to documents seen by POLITICO, the agency warned that 75 percent of employees could quit.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the final decision on how to treat U.K. employees is still the \u201csubject of ongoing discussions at the level of the European Commission,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe EBA declined to comment.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, agencies have very limited room for maneuver as \u201cit is impossible for the agencies to grant even one euro more\u201d than regulations dictate, union representative Géradon said. So although a private sector solution might be to provide financial benefits either to incentivize staff to move, or to cushion the blow for those who resign, that isn\u2019t possible for the EBA and EMA.\u000a\u000aThe union has proposed that staffers who do not wish to relocate could have their contracts terminated instead of having to resign. Although it would be cheaper to force employees to resign without benefits, it could be seen as the agencies neglecting their \u201cduty of care\u201d to employees given the exceptional circumstances, Géradon said. \u201c[Brexit] is, of course, different from the reassignment of a few colleagues,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are anxious, but they know that nobody knows anything\u201d \u2014 Félix Géradon, deputy secretary-general of Union Syndicale Bruxelles\u000a\u000aGéradon said he expects that come November, when it becomes clear where the agencies are moving to, staff members will start to decide whether they will follow. For now, though, there is still huge uncertainty.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are anxious,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they know that nobody knows anything, so they don\u2019t ask too specific questions because nobody can answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarmen Paun contributed reporting.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Are you an EBA or EMA staff member? If so POLITICO would like to talk to you about how the move is affecting you. EBA employees please email Cat Contiguglia (ccontiguglia@politico.eu). EMA employees please email Helen Collis (hcollis@politico.eu). We will treat your email as strictly confidential.\u000a\u000aCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the previous home of the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training. It was located in Bramshill, west of London.

aVCampaign donations, lobbying and influence in government and reports on the special interests that are funding elections and buying power.\u000a\u000aJust when we learned what \u201cCitizens United\u201d and \u201csuper PACs\u201d were all about, the U.S. Supreme Court has again roiled the world of campaign finance, voting 5-4 to allow even more money into a political process that is pretty well saturated with it.\u000a\u000aSo what does it all mean? We at the Center for Public Integrity shall try to provide some answers.\u000a\u000aWhat did the Supreme Court do?\u000a\u000aIn essence, the court said that the government cannot prevent citizens from giving campaign contributions to as many different candidates and political parties as they want. Previously, they were capped under the \u201caggregate limit\u201d rule.\u000a\u000aWhat were the limits?\u000a\u000aPrior to the case, known as McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, individuals were prohibited from giving more than $48,600 combined to all federal candidates. They were also prohibited from giving more than $74,600 combined to all parties and political action committees. Altogether that added up to $123,200. These aggregate limits are now gone.\u000a\u000aDoes that mean donors can give a candidate as much as they want?\u000a\u000aNo. Because the Supreme Court upheld the existing \u201cbase\u201d contribution limits, McCutcheon does not mean that billionaires are free to give as much money as they want to any particular candidate.\u000a\u000aThe maximum amount one donor can give each candidate is still $2,600 per election, or $5,200 counting the primary and general election. The maximum contribution to a national party committee is still $32,400, and the maximum PAC contribution is still $5,000.\u000a\u000aWhy do aggregate contribution limits exist in the first place?\u000a\u000aCongress created the aggregate limit rule to prevent donors from circumventing the base limits by contributing to several groups, which would in turn give that money to a single candidate.\u000a\u000aBut the rules have changed since the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, when aggregate limits were introduced. Now, if one donor used a network of affiliated PACs to fund a single federal candidate, he or she would be breaking the law.\u000a\u000aSo what does McCutcheon mean for candidates?\u000a\u000aCandidates can now more easily band together and raise big money from the same individuals through legal entities called \u201cjoint fundraising committees.\u201d These committees let contributors write a single large check to an umbrella group, which, in turn, splits the money up among several beneficiaries.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, joint fundraising committees have proliferated, and McCutcheon has empowered them to become even bigger. Cue the \u201cjumbo" joint fundraising committees.\u000a\u000aHow much money are we talking about?\u000a\u000aThe short answer is we don\u2019t know. During the 2012 election, both President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney operated joint fundraising groups that often asked each donor to give $75,800 \u2014 one of the aggregate limits at the time. This money was then split between each man\u2019s campaign and various party groups. Now, the sky\u2019s the limit, but it remains to be seen how it\u2019ll play out in practice.\u000a\u000aWhat does McCutcheon mean for the political parties?\u000a\u000aMcCutcheon means more money for the national party committees. Want to give the legal maximum of $32,400 apiece to the national party committees of your choice? Now you can. In fact, the Republican National Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have already formed a super-sized joint fundraising committee that is legally allowed to receive $97,200 per donor per year.\u000a\u000aWill McCutcheon affect state laws too?\u000a\u000aMcCutcheon\u2019s ripple effect could soon be coming to a state near you, and with it, more money from wealthy donors. At least eight states \u2014 and possibly as many as 20 \u2014 could see laws overturned, depending on how regulators, government officials and judges interpret the McCutcheon ruling.\u000a\u000aHow is the McCutcheon case different than Citizens United?\u000a\u000aThe Citizens United decision in 2010 didn\u2019t affect contribution limits to candidates or parties. It affected spending. There\u2019s a difference. Citizens United, along with a lower court ruling, allowed for unlimited donations from corporations, unions and individuals to go to super PACs and nonprofits, which, in turn, could spend the money on ads blasting or praising candidates. That\u2019s not considered a corrupting influence because these groups are banned from coordinating their spending with candidates.\u000a\u000aWhy are some people so concerned about McCutcheon?\u000a\u000aCampaign finance reform advocates are concerned about a sort of systemic corruption that may arise through the formation of jumbo joint fundraising committees. The leader \u2014 possibly a ranking party member \u2014 might become a sort of power broker, and the person who wrote the check would no doubt be remembered fondly as the Congress goes about its business.

aVPay attention to the fine print and you\u2019ll see that some of the online messages touting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton are paid for by \u201cHillary for America,\u201d while others are sponsored by the \u201cHillary Victory Fund.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow powerful is this two-word change? It means the difference between ads funded by donors who may legally give Clinton up to $2,700 \u2014 or by those who may give hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u000a\u000aJoint fundraising committees, often called \u201cvictory funds,\u201d are not new in federal politics. Candidates routinely raise money through these collaborative operations that, by design, split the funds they collect among a number of beneficiaries, such as national and state party committees, as well as the candidate\u2019s own campaign.\u000a\u000aBut instead of just transferring its cash to the signatories of the joint fundraising agreement, the Clinton campaign is also using a significant amount of the money the Hillary Victory Fund collects to finance pro-Clinton advertising.\u000a\u000aThis is innovative, to say the least. But it\u2019s also worrisome to campaign finance reformers who see it as a way to shift costs onto groups funded by big donors, thereby evading campaign contribution limits.\u000a\u000aAnd in that respect, critics see Clinton\u2019s big-money operation as a way for well-heeled donors to better access and influence the woman who may be the next president of the United States.\u000a\u000aLarry Noble, general counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for stricter campaign finance regulations, told the Center for Public Integrity that Clinton\u2019s team had taken the interpretation of a joint fundraising committee \u201cto another level.\u201d\u000a\u000aVideos produced by the Hillary Victory Fund, and appearing online on websites like YouTube and Twitter, \u201care basically campaign ads,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThis is a problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aDemocratic operatives, however, argue that Clinton and her party allies should use all available financial weapons to fight Republicans.\u000a\u000aJosh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, told the Center for Public Integrity that online videos help \u201cgive people a reason to donate\u201d to the Hillary Victory Fund, which he called \u201ccritical to funding the coordinated campaigns that are helping elect Democrats up and down the ballot.\u201d

aVTrump's vacation tweets -- Coalition campaigns against Sinclair merger -- Kayleigh McEnany named RNC spokesperson\u000a\u000aWith Alex Weprin\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TWEETED 13 TIMES ON MONDAY, 6 OF THEM ABOUT THE MEDIA. The president is at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club on a working vacation, during which he clearly had some time for tweets about the media. He sent off screeds about the \u201cfake news\u201d ignoring his success and incorrectly reporting about the strength of his base, and he tweeted about The New York Times and other \u201cFake News\u201d ignoring North Korean sanctions.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a--This has become rote, but we\u2019ll do it again.

At the same time he tweeted that \u201cThe Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!\u201d CNN was covering those exact sanctions (their segment started about two minutes before the tweet).\u000a\u000a--Trump slammed The New York Times several times as \u201ctotally inept\u201d and asked \u201cHow much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?\u201d Let\u2019s assume Trump is responding to the Times\u2019 recent story about Republicans (and specifically Vice President Mike Pence) running a shadow 2020 primary. Jonathan Martin, one of the reporters on that piece, noted on Twitter that their story did not have a single anonymous quote. And, The New York Times has been having a bit of a Trump business boom as they also noted on Twitter : revenue is up 9 percent and subscriptions are growing 69 percent faster than same quarter last year, the newspaper announced last month. The stock was recently at its highest level since May of 2008.\u000a\u000aTRUMP BASHES THE \u201cMAINSTREAM MEDIA,\u201d BUT PAYS A STAFFER $89,000 TO SPOT AND DISTRIBUTE POSITIVE STORIES FROM THEM via my colleague Annie Karni: \u201cThe White House director of rapid response, Andrew Hemming, 31, spends his days immersed in cable television, Twitter, print and online media to suss out positive stories about Trump, which he blasts back out to his list of more than 1,000 influencers \u2014 mainly reporters, but also television talking heads \u2014 who together craft the overall story of Trump\u2019s presidency. There\u2019s nothing new about an administration trying to promote its wins.

The Daily Beast also reports that the Tomi Lahren, a former anchor for right-wing media network The Blaze and a current spokeswoman for pro-Trump nonprofit Great America Alliance, had been \u201cstrongly considered\u201d for a position with the Trump TV production.\u000a\u000aAT&T SAYS IT WON\u2019T SELL CNN, by Alex Weprin: A top AT&T executive said that the company has no interest in selling CNN, alleviating concerns many inside the channel had about what would happen once AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner is approved by the federal government. John Stankey, who will lead Time Warner\u2019s businesses once the deal closes, told The Hollywood Reporter \u201cIt would be a strategically missed opportunity if we weren\u2019t in that [the news] business.\u201d Stankey also said that AT&T would not interfere with CNN\u2019s editorial content, noting \u201cyou can\u2019t run a national news organization with that importance to our society without maintaining its editorial independence.\u201d\u000a\u000a--On a related note: CBS execs also poured cold water on the idea they might be interested in buying CNN. "We feel strategically complete," CBS COO Joseph Ianniello said on the company's earnings call Monday. CBS did announce that it plans to launch a 24/7 streaming sports channel, similar to CBSN, later this year.\u000a\u000aPREET BHARARA PODCAST GETS PUBLIC RADIO PICKUP, by Alex Weprin: Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is joining the ranks of the mainstream media. Bharara\u2019s podcast, \u201cStay Tuned with Preet,\u201d has been picked up by WNYC Studios, the podcast and public radio show collective that also produces \u201cRadiolab\u201d and Alec Baldwin\u2019s \u201cHere\u2019s the Thing.\u201d Some Spider Studios, founded by Bharara\u2019s brother Vinit, will also produce, as will Pineapple Street Media, best known for \u201cMissing Richard Simmons.\u201d\u000a\u000aCOALITION CAMPAIGNS AGAINST SINCLAIR-TRIBUNE MERGER, my colleague Margaret Harding McGill reports for POLITICO Pro. A group comprised of One America News Network\u2019s president, a former FCC commissioner, and satellite TV giant DISH network among others is banding together to fight against Sinclair Broadcasting Group\u2019s proposed expansion. In a call with reporters on Monday OANN President Charles Herring argued that Sinclair is already too powerful and growing larger could shut out independent sources of programming (such as his channel), and will lead to higher prices for customers.\u000a\u000a--"The concern is that with the market strength Sinclair will have post-merger, it could take pretty much any channel it wants, regardless of the merit of that channel with the consumers or the cable company, and basically force it on the cable company and thus the consumers," Herring said.\u000a\u000aTRUMP ISN\u2019T HAPPY WITH JOSHUA GREEN\u2019S NEW BOOK ABOUT STEVE BANNON: According to the Daily Caller , President Donald Trump is not pleased that Green\u2019s new book \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain\u201d says Steve Bannon had a major role in Trump\u2019s electoral victory. \u201cA source who spoke with the president recently told TheDC that Trump complained about the new book as well as the cover of a November copy of Forbes that claims Jared Kushner was the campaign\u2019s mastermind. \u2018I hate it when people take credit for an election I won,\u2019 Trump said, according to the source.\u000a\u000aVOX STUDIED 17 MONTHS OF TRUMP\u2019S FAVORITE SHOW \u201cFOX & FRIENDS\u201d and found that the show has increasingly changed its role as giving advice to the president. \u201cAn analysis of the show's transcripts reveal that about 8 to 9 percent of sentences before Trump's election were imperative sentences, which instruct or advise.

aVBritish police officers stand on duty outside the entrance to the Supreme Court in London | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Top UK judge: British judiciary needs more clarity on Brexit British parliament must be \u2018very clear\u2019 on whether judges should consider rulings from European Court of Justice after Brexit, says Lord Neuberger.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s most senior judge said the British government must provide more guidance on how British law will be developed and the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) after Brexit.\u000a\u000aThe British parliament must be \u201cvery clear\u201d in informing judges about how to take into account decisions from the EU\u2019s highest court after the U.K. leaves the bloc, Lord David Edmond Neuberger, who is president of the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court, told the BBC on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf [the British government] doesn\u2019t express clearly what the judges should do about decisions of the ECJ after Brexit, or indeed any other topic after Brexit, then the judges will simply have to do their best,\u201d said Lord Neuberger.\u000a\u000aLord Neuberger added the British judiciary would spell out \u201cin a statute\u201d how judges should approach the issue and warned that \u201cto blame the judges for making the law when parliament has failed to do so would be unfair.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe role of the ECJ \u2014 an institution hated by ardent Brexiteers \u2014 has become a contentious issue in Brexit negotiations. U.K. legislation is currently subject to ECJ rulings.\u000a\u000aBritish Prime Minister Theresa May and her government insist that the EU\u2019s highest court should have no jurisdiction over the U.K. after it has divorced from the bloc. But European lawmakers strongly disagree, claiming Britain would continue to be bound by ECJ rulings after Brexit. The U.K. government has conceded Britain could be subject to the court\u2019s rulings for some time during a transition period.\u000a\u000aLord Neuberger insisted the British judiciary will follow the letter of the law in either case.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the U.K. parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so,\u201d Lord Neuberger said. \u201cIf it says we shouldn\u2019t then we won\u2019t. Basically, we will do what the statute says.\u201d\u000a\u000aLord Neuberger, who has served as the president of the British Supreme Court since 2012, will step down next month.

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s promise to overhaul the federal government hit another obstacle last week when his pick to head the Office of Personnel Management, George Nesterczuk, quietly withdrew from consideration\u2014leaving the administration with no nominee to run a small but crucial agency that oversees policies for all 2 million employees of the federal government and would be integral to any sweeping effort to reform its workforce.\u000a\u000aNesterczuk was a logical Republican pick to head the agency: a former OPM official with decades of experience in personnel issues. But he had become caught up in a contentious fight when public-sector unions sent a letter in late July protesting his nomination, objecting to his position on civil service reform and raising questions\u2014without any specific allegations or evidence\u2014about his work for the Ukrainian government under pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, and potential ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\u000a\u000aThe White House, which did not answer a request for comment, withdrew his name last Wednesday afternoon. In a letter to Trump last week, Nesterczuk said he was pulling out over the partisan atmosphere and \u201cbaseless\u201d allegations against him. \u201cI do not wish to be a distraction for the administration while I defend my integrity,\u201d he wrote. According to multiple sources who were tracking his nomination, the confirmation process was moving slowly, in part because he hadn\u2019t even submitted his paperwork to the relevant committee, despite being nominated in May.\u000a\u000aThis leaves the White House with a hole in a key spot for its agenda. \u201cHis withdrawal is a huge obstacle [to reform] because they don\u2019t have anybody in the White House with any federal government expertise,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on Al Gore\u2019s \u201cReinventing Government\u201d initiative. \u201cThey would need somebody like Nesterczuk to walk them through [civil service policies].\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump has made big promises about running the government like a business, using evidence to justify policy and personnel decisions. He imposed a hiring freeze\u2014since lifted\u2014on his third full day in office, and, in March, he signed an executive order on a \u201ccomprehensive plan for reorganizing the executive branch,\u201d requiring agencies to submit reorganization plans by September, including information on how to \u201cmaximize the performance of government workers.\u201d In May, the Trump administration released its 2018 budget, including huge cuts to domestic spending that would require a significant reduction in the federal workforce.\u000a\u000aBut the federal workforce is bound by a dense web of rules, and any major changes will require the OPM to get involved. The 6,300-person agency acts as the human resources department for the entire federal government, setting policies on health and retirement benefits and how agencies can hire and fire workers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the type of thing where if you just wade into it without information, it\u2019s really easy to break things,\u201d said Jeffrey Neal, a former chief human capital officer at the Department of Homeland Security, who writes a blog on the government\u2019s HR practices. \u201cFor example, you can really screw up pay. You can screw it up and pay people too much and they\u2019ll never leave. You can screw it up and pay too little and be unable to hire. You can break an agency\u2019s workforce.\u201d\u000a\u000aOPM has been crucial to reform efforts in the past. The Clinton administration\u2019s \u201cReinventing Government\u201d plan, run by Gore, used OPM to offer employees across the federal government buyouts of up to $50,000 to leave their jobs. In the end, the administration was able to cut 420,000 jobs, with only 25,000 coming through layoffs.\u000a\u000aAsked whether the withdrawal is a setback for the administration's government-reform efforts, an OPM spokesperson said, \u201cOPM is committed to working diligently to support whoever our future nominee will be, but for now we will carry on our daily responsibilities at OPM and continue to move forward with our mission.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough many government employees are anxious about Trump\u2019s plans, government personnel policies are also widely seen to be in need of an overhaul: The current U.S. civil service rules date back to 1978, when Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act. Those rules were built for a world when the iPhone was science fiction, and critics say they hamstring the government from hiring talented workers and removing poor performers. \u201cYou tell me what organization that is successful today that last transformed its rules around talent almost 40 years ago,\u201d said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Administration, a nonpartisan group that has tracked the nomination process. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000aNesterczuk had years of experience with these types of issues working at OPM during the George W. Bush and Reagan administrations. Under Bush, he was a central figure on a controversial reform to the Department of Defense\u2019s civilian personnel policies known as the National Security Personnel System, which moved the DOD\u2019s seniority-based pay system to one based on performance. But the new system, an internal DOD report found, discriminated against women and minorities.\u000a\u000aThough Neal, who worked on the program at the Department of Defense, said the problems with discrimination were fixable, the entire program was ultimately torpedoed amid the Bush administration\u2019s attempt to impose new restrictions on collective bargaining for public-sector unions. That triggered a partisan political fight on the overhaul, ultimately dooming the project: Congress, led by Democrats, repealed the NSPS in the fiscal 2010 defense authorization bill.\u000a\u000aThat gives a sense of the minefield that awaits any president attempting workforce reforms. Unions remember Nesterczuk\u2019s role implementing the system and were adamantly opposed to his nomination. \u201cHe has a history of extreme hostility to federal employees and the missions of their agencies,\u201d said Jacque Simon, policy director for the American Federation for Government Employees, one of the groups that sent the letter. The letter writers also wanted lawmakers to seek more information about Nesterczuk\u2019s work for the Ukrainian government and raised the question of potential ties to Manafort, who worked on the Reagan transition when Nesterczuk was tapped to be an OPM official.\u000a\u000aNesterczuk could not be reached for comment for this article. In an interview with the Washington Post last month, he called the allegations \u201cfiction \u2026 made up stuff.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe withdrawal is part of broader woes the administration has had in filling key positions. Trump has still not nominated people to fill 354 of 577 key positions, according to a tracker maintained by the Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service. Just 117 nominees have been confirmed, far fewer than President Barack Obama or Bush had put in place this far into their terms.\u000a\u000aIn addition to putting a brake on any personnel reforms the administration has in mind, the OPM vacancy also leaves the administration without its top adviser on personnel as agencies submit their reorganization plans, which are due in September. Trump must now find a new candidate for the job, delaying Senate approval until at least the fall. The latest any previous administration installed its first OPM director was July 11 under Bush; most were confirmed in the spring.\u000a\u000a\u201cCivil service reform is difficult in a nonpolitical environment. In a highly politicized environment, it\u2019s incredibly difficult,\u201d said Neal. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to pull off if there isn\u2019t somebody sitting there at OPM who is a part of the administration that also has day-to-day exposure to folks at OPM. That\u2019s incredibly important.\u201d

aVAllegations against Germany\u2019s mighty car industry have flown thick and fast this week, but regulators are still asking themselves whether the carmakers really operated a hardcore cartel that scammed consumers for decades.\u000a\u000aBrussels and Bonn are investigating whether Germany\u2019s top five auto companies \u2014 Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche and Volkswagen \u2014 colluded at regular, and secret, meetings held to discuss technical standards, suppliers, costs and other issues. The meetings, revealed by Der Spiegel, spanned more than two decades.\u000a\u000aWhat looks like a cartel to outsiders may not be so obvious to regulators. Despite the stunning allegations, antitrust enforcers in Brussels are proceeding with caution. Automakers are quietly mounting a defense. And BMW, one of the five supposed members, said it has been neither raided by antitrust enforcers in connection to this inquiry nor questioned about the concerns.\u000a\u000aWhy would Volkswagen and Daimler formally confess to a cartel if there wasn\u2019t one? The prospect of gaining immunity from fines by blowing the whistle is an enticing one \u2014 too much so, say critics, who argue the immunity system encourages companies to portray their conduct in the worst possible light. After all, it\u2019s the others that will have to foot the bill before regulators.\u000a\u000aWhat first appears to be collusion can look different when new facts emerge, or when those facts don\u2019t mean a breach of EU laws. The Commission dropped a cartel probe into bioethanol producers earlier this year. And some 18 months ago it dropped charges that the world\u2019s largest investment banks colluded to carve up the market for credit default swaps.\u000a\u000a\u201cExcept in classical cartel cases, the mere fact that competitors would collaborate and exchange information is not in and of itself sufficient to find a violation,\u201d said Paul Lugard, a partner at law firm Baker Botts in Brussels. Whether it is illegal or not depends on how they cooperated and why, what sort of information was exchanged and what effect the collaboration had, he explained.\u000a\u000aThere are suggestions from Brussels that at least some of the carmakers\u2019 conduct falls into a gray zone.\u000a\u000aCompetitors can and do work together on developing new technologies or rolling out essential infrastructure. Joint purchasing, which seems to have been part of what was discussed, can foster competition.\u000a\u000aDaimler has already picked up a record \u20ac1 billion cartel fine for colluding with rival truckmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is quite common for car manufacturers all over the world to engage in an exchange on technical issues in order to accelerate the pace and quality of innovations,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement Wednesday that didn\u2019t directly address the allegations. It added that cooperation between competitors can cut costs for consumers.\u000a\u000aA Daimler spokesperson declined to comment on \u201cspeculations\u201d but said the company has a \u201ccomprehensive antitrust compliance program.\u201d A spokesperson for BMW said it was assessing the situation. Earlier this week it said that certain discussions reported by Der Spiegel aimed to increase the availability of diesel exhaust fluid in Europe.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s car industry is widely considered the ultimate symbol of the country\u2019s economic prowess, and its influence stretches deep into politics and the administration.\u000a\u000aThe Commission says it\u2019s not giving anyone preferential treatment. \u201cOur track record of busting cartels, especially in the car sector, speaks for itself,\u201d said Ricardo Cardoso, the Commission spokesperson for competition. The Commission notes it has uncovered nine cartels in the automotive sector over the past 10 years and fined companies almost \u20ac6 billion \u2014 including a \u20ac2.9 billion sanction for a cartel of truckmakers that included Daimler and two Volkswagen subsidiaries.\u000a\u000aThe Commission confirmed it is assessing information about the exchanges between carmaker engineers, adding it was \u201cpremature at this stage to speculate further.\u201d\u000a\u000aDer Spiegel, which published a detailed and damning investigation into \u201cdas Kartell\u201d late last week, said Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, confessed to German and European enforcers in July 2016 in a bid to secure immunity from fines. The Süddeutsche Zeitung says Daimler submitted information to regulators in 2014, or even earlier.\u000a\u000aOne crucial element makes it nearly impossible for the Commission, as well as the carmakers, to defend themselves in public: The omertà imposed around cartel probes.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you mention [the case], you lose any benefit,\u201d said one antitrust lawyer, who declined to comment on the record because his firm does work for the German car sector.\u000a\u000aDefendants are stripped of their immunity or any leniency if they reveal their talks with the Commission, as that might prompt others to destroy evidence. The Commission keeps its communications to the bare minimum, for fear of tipping off potential defendants and to respect the presumption of innocence.\u000a\u000aThat seems a strange position to maintain when almost all of Europe now knows the Commission is looking at this issue. But it explains the short and sometimes cryptic remarks from all sides.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible that these are arrangements between competitors that have some benefits, but this might have slipped into a cartel\u201d \u2014 antitrust lawyer\u000a\u000aDaimler has already picked up a record \u20ac1 billion cartel fine for colluding with rival truckmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think more likely is that Daimler was severely hit by [the investigation into the trucks cartel] and they wanted to be on the safe side,\u201d said one seasoned observer who requested anonymity as his firm is seeking a mandate in the probe. The same would apply to Volkswagen, which has paid out $20 billion over Dieselgate and has two subsidiaries caught up in the trucks cartel.\u000a\u000aAnalyzing whether exchanges between competitors actually qualify for an exemption under EU competition law can take time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible that these are arrangements between competitors that have some benefits, but this might have slipped into a cartel,\u201d the antitrust lawyer said.\u000a\u000aCardoso, the Commission spokesperson, said: \u201cThe length of cartel investigations is case-specific and depends on a number factors, including the complexity of the case and the cooperation of the companies with the Commission and the exercise of the rights of defense.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the trucks cartel, Volkswagen\u2019s subsidiary MAN first contacted the Commission with information in September 2010, prompting dawn raids across the sector that January.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s reaction is not always so prompt.\u000a\u000aIn a decision sanctioning a cartel rigging the sale of thermal systems of cars, which led to fines of \u20ac155 million in March 2017, Panasonic went to regulators in December 2010, leading enforcers to request information from rivals in July 2011 and some raids in May 2012.\u000a\u000aIn the alternators and starters cartel, which led to fines of \u20ac137 million in 2016, a request for immunity by Denso in February 2011 prompted regulators to quiz rivals in July of that year.\u000a\u000aClick on the image to enlarge.

aVFinance reform fueled by pre-Enron scandals\u000a\u000aBut Enron stood on the shoulders of presidential pardons issued to the politically connected, Buddhist temple fundraisers, the selling of the Lincoln Bedroom, the failed presidential campaigns of Ross Perot in 1992 and Sen. John McCain in 2000, and the generally accepted belief that money is a corrupting influence in politics.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 The easy answer, and the incomplete one, to explain the passage of campaign finance reform early Thursday is that the Enron scandal so shook members of the House of Representatives that they finally were compelled to do the previously unthinkable: vote against their political self-interest.\u000a\u000aThat collective weight finally overcame one of the capital's most durable forces, the status quo, to substantially change the way money and politics intersect in federal elections.\u000a\u000aBefore the House vote, campaign finance had been an issue of undeniable popularity with voters but also one that seemed distant and not very important to them. Therefore, politicians could claim to be for reform while taking comfort in the fact that it would never happen and that their campaigns could continue to benefit from the system they righteously decried.\u000a\u000aThere are a few exceptions, such as Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), the less-famous half of the McCain-Feingold duo that pushed campaign finance legislation through the Senate last spring.\u000a\u000a"I have a seven-year perspective on it," Feingold said. "If the real history of this is written, this was inevitable. It was built brick by brick. People will say it was Enron, but it was the combination of all the scandals that occurred as we were trying to pass the bill. . . . But it sure as heck didn't hurt to have this symbol of corporate irresponsibility."\u000a\u000aIt is possible that any celebration over the House vote is premature. If the Senate cannot agree to accept the House version of the bill, it will be sent to a House-Senate conference committee, where the long knives behind closed doors would no doubt try to gut it.\u000a\u000aA ban on soft money\u000a\u000aThe legislation bans soft money, the unlimited, largely unregulated contributions made to political parties by corporations, individuals and labor unions. In past campaigns, parties have used that money to launch scores of thinly disguised attack ads, circumventing fundraising restrictions on individual candidates. Indeed, soft money had been the donation of choice for the well-connected, with parties taking in nearly $495 million in soft money in 2000.\u000a\u000aFor his part, President Bush has signaled a willingness to sign the legislation, but he has stopped short of an endorsement. During the presidential campaign, Bush opposed the legislation even as his opponent, Democrat Al Gore, said he would make it the first proposal he sent to Capitol Hill. During his campaign, Bush raised so much money he declined to take federal matching funds.\u000a\u000aStill, opposing the bill is hardly worth the risk for the president. "Our president is not going to expend any major amount of political capital to beat this," said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.\u000a\u000aGans said that while Enron might have helped propel the bill to the House floor for a vote, it remains ambiguous as to whether the company's ample political donations were an apt example of what was wrong with campaign finance.\u000a\u000a"In a rational world, [Enron] probably should have done nothing about campaign finance legislation because this was a corporate fraud not condoned by the administration or either house of Congress," he said. "There seems to be no real relationship at this point between money given or lobbying and final result. But I think the aura of scandal probably helped to make this possible."

aVEAST PALO ALTO \u2014 Toothaches or asthma can cloud the minds of children who are eager to learn, but a new private school started by Dr. Priscilla Chan and her husband, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, might be just what the doctor ordered.\u000a\u000aIn East Palo Alto, a city with minorities and families living in poverty near the wealthy enclaves of Silicon Valley, The Primary School opened its doors this year to 51 low-income preschool students. It boasts an innovative curriculum that addresses children\u2019s health needs as part of their educational experience.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many ways a school can really help a child be in their optimal frame of mind to be successful in the classroom that are way more common than what we traditionally define as special needs,\u201d said Chan, a pediatrician and CEO of the school, in an exclusive interview.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School\u2019s current students are 4 or 5 years old, but it continues to recruit more students and teachers. It will add more grades every year until it\u2019s fully built out to serve 700 families in East Palo Alto and Menlo Park\u2019s Belle Haven neighborhood. By that time, it will have 450 students from preschool to eighth grade and 250 kids from birth to 2 years old.\u000a\u000aThe school provides a free education for its students, who are selected through a lottery.\u000a\u000aAcross the nation, a growing number of schools such as the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone in New York and publicly funded \u201ccommunity schools\u201d also bring in health and social services, education experts say. And while some of these schools have seen success, the cost per child typically is expensive. Not all low-income communities have the resources to make it work.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a very fragmented system with different organizations and government offices that are responsible for different parts of the child, which means that the same child often slips through the cracks because no one thinks to check that the reason why they\u2019re not doing well in school is they can\u2019t see the blackboard,\u201d said Deborah Stipek, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.\u000a\u000aWhile the Primary School hasn\u2019t disclosed how much it costs to run, some of its executives noted they\u2019re leveraging help from community organizations and health care providers. The school said it isn\u2019t ready to let a reporter visit a classroom or talk to parents and teachers, but its leaders shared some of the work they\u2019ve been doing in its first school year.\u000a\u000aPartnering with the Ravenswood Family Health Center, the Primary School\u2019s teachers received training on how to spot and manage a child with asthma, one of the leading causes of school absenteeism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aAt least one-fifth of the kids at The Primary School have a significant asthma condition, said Meredith Liu, the school\u2019s president and chief operating officer.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur goal is to equip parents and teachers and people who work with kids every day to manage the health rather than building an expensive system on top of it,\u201d Liu said.\u000a\u000aRavenswood dentists also stopped by to clean some students\u2019 teeth as part of a project called \u201cVirtual Dental Home.\u201d\u000a\u000aParents of students at the school work with coaches and teachers to help write growth plans to measure and track a child\u2019s health, education and social-emotional progress, such as having a healthy relationship with adults or knowing how to ask for assistance.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe had some kids who were barely making eye contact when they came in and now they\u2019re speaking,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAnd just the ability to have a friend seems like small things for us, but makes all the difference for these kids.\u201d\u000a\u000aInside the classroom, kids learned about healthy eating and even pretended they were doctors in a clinic taking care of imaginary babies. Students start off the day in a community circle, and then split into smaller groups to discuss different topics, Chan said.\u000a\u000aIn one group, children discussed who lived in their community. One classroom decided insects lived in their community, so they drew pictures of bugs and studied them.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s really an immersive experience led by the child\u2019s interest,\u201d said Chan, a former teacher.\u000a\u000aThe Ravenswood City School District, another one of The Primary School\u2019s partners, is looking for what it can learn from the program to bring into its own public-school classrooms. Gloria Hernandez-Goff, the district\u2019s superintendent, said she\u2019s interested in working with the school to improve the professional development of the district\u2019s teachers and provide students with more social-emotional support.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that investments in early childhood education, especially for low-income kids, pay off. A recent study co-authored by Nobel laureate James Heckman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development, found that high-quality birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children deliver a 13 percent return on investment each year. That\u2019s because when they grow into adults, they\u2019re healthier, better educated and less likely to be incarcerated.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School is one of Chan\u2019s and Zuckerberg\u2019s most hands-on educational investments in the Bay Area. The couple in 2014 pledged to contribute $120 million to schools in low-income Bay Area communities.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, Zuckerberg and Chan donated $100 million to turn around public schools in Newark, New Jersey. But a book titled \u201cThe Prize,\u201d by Dale Russakoff, characterized the work as a failure because large chunks of the money went to labor and contract costs, charter schools and consultants.\u000a\u000aCiting concerns about student privacy, The Primary School declined to disclose its exact location, but noted it sits near the Ravenswood Family Health Center.\u000a\u000aCreating a culture where parents, teachers and doctors communicate better with each other about a child\u2019s needs doesn\u2019t necessarily need to cost more, Chan said.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s one area that Dr. Ryan Padrez is focusing on as the school\u2019s medical director.\u000a\u000aA challenge for pediatricians is that they see families only when they reach out to them and make an appointment. But parents and teachers see a student every day, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven in these first few months, we\u2019re still really just uncovering what can be possible in regards to developing a new innovative model to really go beyond what can be achieved in the pediatric office.\u201d

aVAfter nearly a year of disappointment, triumphalism, hand-wringing, head-scratching and confusion, Brexit talks are finally underway. The two teams met on schedule Monday with an exchange of gifts and an agreement on how the talks would proceed. The U.K. made a significant concession by agreeing to talk about what the EU wants to talk about (the terms of the divorce) before moving on to what it wants to talk about (trade and the future relationship between the two sides).\u000a\u000aOne key issue that must be tackled early on is settling the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the rest of the bloc \u2014 the so-called Brexit bill. That impacts on everything else because unless the EU27 deems \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the money negotiations, they say they aren\u2019t willing to move on to other things. Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to what is at stake in 16 different policy areas once that\u2019s out of the way.\u000a\u000aTRADE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K. and EU27 economies are interlinked to the closest possible degree, and any disruption in trade in goods or services will hit companies, banks and consumers on both sides hard \u2014 particularly the British. Hammering out a good trade deal will be difficult though \u2014 politically and in terms of time and negotiations constraints \u2014 and there\u2019s also trouble ahead at the World Trade Organization.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? EU trade deals with third countries will be affected but will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British business and consumers; German and Japanese carmakers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU businesses that snap up British counterparts (e.g. airlines, banks); EU hubs like Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris (as British businesses relocate).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a softer Brexit preserves single market access (like Norway) or an interim deal is struck, buying time for more talks on a full trade deal.\u000a\u000aKey people on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft, second permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), Catherine Webb, director of market access and budget at DExEU and Simon Case, director general for the U.K.-EU partnership at the U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep).\u000a\u000aKey people on EU side: Deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand, Antonio Fernandez-Martos (head of international agreements, trade and customs in the EU\u2019s Brexit team).\u000a\u000aCUSTOMS/SURFACE TRANSPORT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K.\u2019s biggest freight port and carmakers like Nissan, Toyota and BMW have issued stark warnings that leaving the EU customs union will put their businesses at risk. For the port of Dover, any border checks for truck transit would clog up roads almost immediately. Carmakers say they need access to EU markets for the output from plants in Brexit-voting areas of England like Sunderland and Derby, and they have called for interim single market and customs union access beyond 2019.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s rail and road systems will likely operate as normal, although London will have to figure out whether or not to follow EU policy on things like road tolling and social rules for road transporters in the medium-term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Car manufacturers worried about their supply chains and factory workers in their plants. Spare a thought for Ireland too \u2014 without easy access for road freight to and from the Continent via the U.K., the Emerald Isle\u2019s trade will suffer.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Everyone loses if traffic through Dover is disrupted as alternatives are slower and more expensive. But BMW has hinted it might shift production of the iconic Mini from a site near Oxford to one in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. strikes a deal for tariff-free, and crucially check-free, access to the EU customs union \u2014 commonly described in London as \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft and Catherine Webb. Oliver Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser who has been assigned to the thorny issue of an Irish border, assisted by Simon Case.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Antonio Fernandez-Martos. Sabine Weyand will be Robbins\u2019 counterpart on the Irish border.\u000a\u000aCITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTS\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Roughly 4.2 million EU citizens on either side of the Channel will be affected by Brexit \u2014 from British pensioners living in southern Spain to health professionals in the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. The EU has made a priority of settling rights for citizens like pensions and the protection of \u201clife choices\u201d after March 2019. Life choices implies the rights to residence, to work and to enjoy equal treatment with nationals when it comes to employment access, working conditions, benefits and taxes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? If the U.K. is genuine about its \u201cgenerous offer\u201d on citizens\u2019 rights, Brussels won\u2019t try to prevent the U.K. from cutting immigration after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, British universities and London\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU citizens on both sides of the Channel worried about their future status.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How will rights be enforced and protected? A role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is Brussels\u2019 preference and is enshrined in EU law, but that would be contrary to the \u201ctake back control\u201d desired by the U.K.\u2019s Hard Brexiteers.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Glyn Williams, director general at the Home Office.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Marie Simonsen, who is in charge of free movement of citizens and employment on Barnier\u2019s Brexit task force. Her boss is François Arbault, who is responsible for internal market and sectoral policies, but Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, will also follow this strand of the negotiations very closely.\u000a\u000aDEFENSE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake: The EU will lose a country with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear deterrent and an army that can be deployed around the world. On the plus side, the bloc will be free to pursue defense integration \u2014 something London has always opposed. The U.K. will want to ensure it can maintain leverage in areas like the Balkans and coordinate with EU partners outside of NATO operations.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not: The EU is unlikely to create a unified army with a Pentagon-style headquarters. At least not in the short term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. defense companies like BAE Systems if they cannot maintain access to the new EU fund for defense research; EU defense if it loses British military and technical expertise.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: The French, who currently steer EU foreign policy and will now dominate defense policy too; those in the EU who want defense integration.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether \u201cthird countries\u201d \u2014 as the U.K. will be post Brexit \u2014 will have access to EU funds and military operations.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill, national security adviser to the prime minister.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier, responsible for external relations and foreign and security policy on the Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCRIME/TERRORISM/SECURITY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Information sharing will be the key issue in negotiations on security. The U.K. is among the top four contributors to Europol\u2019s main database on crime and the fifth largest user of the agency\u2019s platform to exchange information. Britain will almost certainly lose access to both databases, which would leave EU and U.K. citizens less safe as a result.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Intelligence cooperation mainly occurs at a bilateral level, meaning that the U.K.\u2019s intelligence services will continue to partner with EU allies.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Europol; U.K. police and citizens.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Organized criminals and terrorists operating out of the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. can obtain access to Europol\u2019s databases and the Schengen Information System \u2014 something that would require ECJ oversight.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill and Chris Jones, director general at DExEU.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier.\u000a\u000aDIGITAL ECONOMY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? If London wants to keep its top reputation for startups and data innovation, it will have to negotiate ways to transfer data smoothly to and from the EU. The country\u2019s invasive surveillance practices could stand in the way of that. Migration is also high on the agenda for techies, who fear a brain drain of coders and entrepreneurs. The EU, on the other hand, stands to lose a tech-savvy member with the skills and pro-business agenda the Commission likes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The digital economy \u2014 everyone loves the digital economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Startups in London; research departments across Europe.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Privacy advocates; EU countries that take up Britain\u2019s lead role on tech.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a data transfer deal is struck.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Gila Sacks, director for digital and tech policy at the U.K.\u2019s department of culture, media and sports, will support the DExEU team with expertise.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: François Arbault, key person in charge of internal market and sectoral policies.\u000a\u000aAVIATION\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Some 50 percent of U.K. passenger travel is to or from the EU, and Brexit will also impact trips between the U.K. and trading partners with an open skies agreement with the EU, like the U.S. In total, 42 of the U.K.\u2019s air services agreements are through its membership of the EU and will have to be renegotiated.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Heathrow airport believes it will benefit from Brexit, provided the U.K. puts a system in place allowing for swift entry of passengers and goods.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. airlines \u2014 such as Thomas Cook, EasyJet and jet2.com \u2014 which run a lot of flights to or within EU countries; Passengers, who are likely to pay more due to reduced competition; Ireland, because it has more air traffic to the U.K. than any other EU country.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Some national airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia are looking forward to less competition from U.K. budget airlines.\u000a\u000aKey decision: If a new air services agreement is in place by the time the U.K. leaves the EU and the single aviation market.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Peter Sorensen, who is responsible for aviation, and François Arbault, head of internal market in goods and non-financial services in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCLIMATE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The EU has benefited from the U.K.\u2019s participation in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost renewables and energy efficiency. Britain is one of the EU\u2019s biggest emissions-cutters and a heavyweight country in favor of toughening climate policies such as the Emissions Trading System.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s national Climate Change Act, which aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, is unlikely to be affected. Nor are its policies pricing emissions from power plants and phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2025.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The EU27, which will have to divvy up the U.K.\u2019s national emissions reduction responsibilities, and the U.K., which will lose its influence as a larger member of a big bloc in international climate negotiations.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU27 countries that resist tougher future emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. pulls out of the Emissions Trading System, and whether it will continue to participate in the bloc\u2019s emission reduction efforts.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain, responsible for energy and climate and environment in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force and Nicola Pesaresi, who is in charge of regulatory issues on subjects like climate change and financial stability that could be impacted by the U.K.\u2019s departure.\u000a\u000aENVIRONMENT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? After Brexit, London will be free to decide whether to keep in place environmental rules and standards set by the EU over the years. If the U.K. lowers air quality standards, the EU could be directly impacted, as dirty air doesn\u2019t respect national borders. MEPs have also warned that products imported from the U.K. could, in the future, be made to lower environmental standards, undercutting EU goods.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K., home to a strong tradition of environmental activism, is unlikely to overturn environmental rules en masse, even if it does eliminate regulations it deems unuseful and uncompetitive.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Animal and plant species protected under the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, deemed \u201cEU red tape\u201d by British Brexiteers; the U.K. environment.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British housing developers \u2014 who may no longer have to worry about great crested newts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How environmental standards will be embedded in a future trade deal between the U.K. and EU countries.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aENERGY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? New tariffs or other trade barriers could push up the price of gas and power supplies, putting the U.K., Ireland and others at risk of shortages. In another blow to Britain, they could get in the way of new investment, equipment and expertise for energy infrastructure (particularly nuclear plants).\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The continued flow of electricity and gas between the two sides. Costs and volumes may change, planned new links might run into complications, but existing interconnectors will not disappear after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The Irish-Northern Irish single electricity market; U.K. energy companies in the EU; EU energy companies in Britain; the British nuclear safeguarding regime; new nuclear energy developers in the U.K.; British energy bill payers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Not many. Maybe a few small local energy companies, like those developing shale gas, that would benefit from less international competition.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. leaves the EU\u2019s internal energy market, and whether it continues to follow a complex set of power and gas network rules that make it easier to trade between EU markets.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aFISHING\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Access is the key word in fisheries negotiations. Thousands of EU fishermen rely on U.K. waters for their daily catch. However, the EU is the largest buyer of British fish. This co-dependency means Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s promise to wrangle back control of British seas will be difficult to keep.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? British waters are unlikely to become the Wild West of fishing because the U.K. ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British fish processors and exporters; EU fishermen.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: U.K. fishermen; EU fish processors.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether there will be a deal brokered to swap fishing rights in British waters for access to the world\u2019s largest fish market: the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth, responsible for agriculture, fisheries and maritime policy on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aHEALTH\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brits and Europeans could lose their health insurance for emergency care when policyholders travel abroad. The way medicines will be approved in the U.K. could also be affected once it leaves the bloc. Britain also risks shortages of doctors and nurses, as those from the EU will either leave the U.K. or no longer work in its National Health Service.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Big British pharmaceutical companies will continue to do business in the EU, even if they will probably have to rely more on their continental subsidiaries inside the bloc.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Holidaymakers, patients and the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Insurance companies providing travel insurance; the EU country that gets the European Medicines Agency once it\u2019s relocated from the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps the British medicines approval process aligned with that of the EU; and whether it remains in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which provides the right to free emergency medical care in the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Stefan Fuehring, who\u2019s responsible for health and food safety, as well as justice and home affairs on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aUNIVERSITIES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brexit could lead to a decline in the number of EU students coming to study in the U.K. because they would be recruited as international students, meaning their fees would rise significantly. British universities also risk losing the roughly 15 percent of their budget they get from the EU in research funding. Academics are likely to find it harder to collaborate on research projects with colleagues on the Continent. A change in visa arrangements for other European countries might also prevent them from joining British universities.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Demand for higher education is so high that even if fewer EU students came to study in Britain, universities would be no worse off financially as they compensate by taking more domestic students.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: EU students, and foreign staff and academics; the European Commission\u2019s Erasmus student-exchange program.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British students (who will have better chances of getting a place at university); U.K. universities (that can raise tuition fees for EU nationals and so increase budgets).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a deal is struck giving EU students and academics access to U.K. universities and vice versa.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aFINANCIAL SERVICES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Hundreds of international firms do business across the EU from their London headquarters thanks to so-called passports. The industry is most worried about losing its ability to operate across the bloc from British headquarters. Another issue topping the agenda is the possibility that London will lose euro-clearing activities, a nearly \u20ac1 trillion-a-day business that supports 83,000 jobs in the City of London.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? London\u2019s role as a world-class financial center. Some firms will move some of their operations, but the bulk is likely to stay, allowing the City of London and Canary Wharf to remain major international financial hubs.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British clearing houses; the European Banking Authority; young EU talent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Frankfurt, lawyers and banks (because they always win).\u000a\u000aKey decision: The shape and form of mutual market access, assuming the U.K. loses full single market access and passporting rights.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Bowman, director general, international finance at the Treasury and Philip Rycroft.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aAGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Market access will dominate discussions, with British farmers currently hooked into sophisticated supply chains that deliver produce across Europe. Many EU farmers depend on the U.K. market, but Britain has more to lose. Restricted trade either way will deal EU farmers a heavier blow than Russia\u2019s food import ban, which devastated the industry.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Farms run razor-thin profit margins \u2014 everything is at stake.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British farmers; Dutch and Spanish food exporters; Ireland\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: There are few, but French farmers might benefit if their government \u2014 which the U.K. has traditionally hindered in agricultural affairs \u2014 pushes for a better-funded Common Agricultural Policy.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether negotiators will agree to tariff-free mutual market access.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one on the negotiating team has been specifically assigned this brief but Catherine Webb will deal with market access issues.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth.\u000a\u000aSPACE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Whether the U.K. continues to contribute to the EU\u2019s space program will dictate whether it keeps access to contracts for satellite systems like Galileo, Europe\u2019s version of America\u2019s GPS network. The EU could also freeze British astronauts out of future space missions.

aVMOSCOW\u000a\u000anly a little more than 48 hours had passed since Leonid Volkov had been released from a cramped Moscow detention center, but the outspoken Kremlin critic was already back at work plotting to unseat Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u000a\u000aAs chief of staff for Russian dissident Alexei Navalny\u2019s run for the presidency in an election to be held next March, Volkov is the man behind a grass-roots political campaign unlike anything the country has ever seen.\u000a\u000aIt is Navalny\u2019s sensational exposés of high-level corruption that have seized the national and international spotlight. But it\u2019s Volkov\u2019s organizational effort that has given the 41-year-old, Yale-educated lawyer political footholds in regions far from the capital, in towns and cities that will be essential to any attempt to loosen Putin\u2019s almost two-decade-long grip on power.\u000a\u000aThat is, of course, if Volkov can get Navalny on the ballot.\u000a\u000aBearded, wearing a tieless shirt, the 36-year-old former IT professional was in a distracted mood when he met POLITICO at the campaign\u2019s headquarters in eastern Moscow. Before sitting down for an interview, he spent minutes jabbing away at a smartphone and then recorded a video for the campaign\u2019s increasingly popular YouTube channel.\u000a\u000aThe headquarters, which was raided by police in late March as anti-Putin protests rocked Russia, is sparsely decorated, an open plan office staffed by around a dozen studious twentysomethings. The last time Volkov recorded a live online video here, on June 21, a police officer barged into the studio while the camera was rolling and handed him a summons. Volkov was jailed for five days on a protest-related charge the next afternoon. This time, he managed to record his video without interruption.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are imposing a black and white picture of the world on people. Are you for Putin or are you for Navalny?\u201d \u2014 Leonid Volkov\u000a\u000aDespite relentless pressure from the authorities, Volkov has so far overseen the opening of over 60 Navalny 2018 campaign offices across Russia, from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg. The election campaign, which Volkov said is funded entirely by donations from private Russian citizens, has raised 98 million rubles (\u20ac 1.4 million) via online crowdfunding efforts and recruited more than 120,000 people, many of them in their teens or early twenties, as volunteers nationwide.\u000a\u000aIn the past few months, tens of thousands of anti-government protesters have twice taken to the streets in dozens of cities, breathing new life into an opposition movement that was struggling to survive in the wake of the pro-Putin euphoria that swept Russia following the seizure of Crimea in 2014.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are imposing a black and white picture of the world on people, and forcing them to think about politics and the future of the country,\u201d Volkov said, opening a laptop decorated with a Navalny 2018 sticker. \u201cForcing them to take sides. Are you for Putin or are you for Navalny?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018PRACTICALLY NO CHANCE\u2019\u000a\u000ahe contrast between the Navalny 2018 election effort and the staid, low-energy campaigns traditionally run by Putin and the handful of Kremlin-approved candidates that have been permitted to stand against him over the years could not be greater. Since coming to power in 2000, Putin has not taken part in an election debate, televised or otherwise, and presidential candidates of all stripes have shown little, if any, appetite for campaigning across the vast Russian landscape.\u000a\u000aThe Kremlin hasn\u2019t taken kindly to Navalny\u2019s violation of its unspoken rules. In addition to Volkov, who has been jailed twice in recent months, more than a dozen members of the campaign team, including Navalny, have been locked up for short periods on protest-related charges.\u000a\u000aSecurity forces have raided campaign offices across the country, confiscating computers and other valuable equipment. Others connected to the campaign have been stabbed or beaten with baseball bats. In April, Navalny himself suffered a serious eye injury after he was attacked by a pro-Kremlin activist in Moscow.\u000a\u000aOn top of all this, Russia\u2019s top election official has said there is \u201cpractically no chance\u201d Navalny will be allowed on the ballot in next March\u2019s election, citing a conviction for fraud that the campaign says was trumped up in order to neutralize his political ambitions. Russia\u2019s government-controlled election committee is set to make a final ruling on Navalny\u2019s candidacy in December.\u000a\u000aFor Volkov, the Kremlin\u2019s furious response to the campaign is a clear indication his team is on the right track. And he clearly takes great pleasure in causing headaches for the president\u2019s shadowy advisers. Putin has yet to formally announce he will seek reelection, but few have any doubt he is gearing up for a fourth term that would keep him in power until 2024.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur campaign\u2019s aim is to create an atmosphere in which it is less politically advantageous for the authorities not to register Navalny as an election candidate, than to register him,\u201d Volkov said. \u201cWhen everyone in the country thinks that the only reason Navalny is not being allowed on the ballot is because Putin is afraid of him, then they will have no choice but to let him stand.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not the only scenario under which Navalny might be allowed to run. Russia\u2019s Vedomosti newspaper recently cited sources close to the presidential administration as saying Putin\u2019s advisers were struggling to come up with an inspiring electoral message that the ex-KGB officer could present to the nation ahead of next year\u2019s vote.\u000a\u000aIn an age in which political upsets have become almost routine, Volkov sees no reason why Navalny cannot produce another shock at the March 2018 presidential election.\u000a\u000aPermitting the high-profile dissident to stand could solve that problem by injecting an element of intrigue into the election. It would also neatly allow the Kremlin to counter domestic and international criticism of Russia\u2019s democratic credentials.\u000a\u000aVolkov isn\u2019t prepared \u2014 at least not publicly \u2014 to consider the possibility that a Navalny candidacy could be advantageous to Putin. He looked up from his laptop. \u201cI have a plan, and we are working to it. And everything is turning out excellently for us.\u201d\u000a\u000aA WEIRD EXOTICA\u000a\u000aorn in Yekaterinburg, Russia\u2019s fourth biggest city, in 1980, Volkov was a teenage computer prodigy, representing his hometown region at national and international programming competitions. From there, it was a clear path into the world of IT. He spent some 10 years working at one of Russia\u2019s biggest software companies, SKB Kontur, rising to a senior management position \u2014 experience he said serves him well in his current role.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery day, I had to answer 300 emails, take part in 10 or so conference calls, plus meetings, interviews, as well find inspiring words for various departments,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, not everything that is applicable to business is applicable to politics. The rules of the game change a lot quicker.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a decade in business, Volkov, a keen chess player, branched out into politics. In 2009, after self-financing his campaign to the tune of some \u20ac20,000, Volkov was elected as a local councilor in Yekaterinburg, traditionally one of Russia\u2019s more liberal cities.\u000a\u000aHis victory came amid a low point for Russia\u2019s liberal opposition parties, which were still reeling from a series of humiliating defeats in national and regional votes. Suddenly, Volkov was, as he put it, \u201ca weird exotica: a young and independent elected official.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe first met Navalny, who was already making a name for himself with his anti-corruption investigations, in 2010 at an opposition conference. Around half a year later, Navalny accepted Volkov\u2019s invitation to visit Yekaterinburg, where the seeds of the Navalny 2018 campaign were planted.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe flew in, carried out eight meetings with local businessmen, activists, and journalists, and spoke very convincingly at each of them,\u201d Volkov said. \u201cI remember thinking back then: \u2018This is my presidential candidate.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aNavalny\u2019s visit was also the start of a close friendship between the two men. Besides their mutual loathing of high-level corruption, both share a wry sense of humor.\u000a\u000aThe current campaign isn\u2019t Volkov\u2019s first attempt at securing an elected post for Navalny. In 2013, he headed Navalny\u2019s bid to defeat Sergei Sobyanin, the Putin-appointed incumbent, during Moscow\u2019s mayoral election.\u000a\u000aSobyanin, taking his cue from Putin, declined to debate rival candidates, or even meet publicly with voters. Meanwhile, Volkov masterminded a slick, Western-style campaign. Navalny held up to three stump speeches a day and descended into the metro to distribute campaign materials.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven if we don\u2019t win, if Navalny can get around 30 percent again, this will change things in our country completely\u201d \u2014 Leonid Volkov\u000a\u000aThe hard work paid off. Navalny, who had been polling at around 3 percent just weeks before the election, was barred from national television. And yet he took nearly 30 percent of the vote, securing second place amid rumors of last-minute vote-rigging by city officials desperate to ensure a first-round victory for Sobyanin.\u000a\u000aIn an age in which political upsets have become almost routine, Volkov sees no reason why Navalny cannot produce another shock at the March 2018 presidential election.\u000a\u000aAlthough, like in 2013, Navalny is currently polling at around 2 percent, Volkov is confident a concerted campaign can once again tap into widespread anger over corruption. In a recent opinion poll, 67 percent of Russians said they held Putin personally responsible for failing to prevent the widespread pilfering of Russia\u2019s national resources by officials and government-connected businessmen.\u000a\u000aEven another respectable loss would provide a much-needed jolt to Russia\u2019s political system, Volkov said, as Putin would be forced to confront a genuinely popular opposition leader with millions of supporters nationwide. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t win, if Navalny can get around 30 percent again, this will change things in our country completely.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an ambition that many political observers consider unrealistic in the current political climate. Russian authorities are unlikely to allow Navalny an official run, if only because doing so would allow him access to national television, said Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst whose election monitoring efforts helped spark anti-government protests in Moscow in 2011.\u000a\u000aEven if Navalny were to run, Oreshkin said, he would struggle to get more than 10 percent of the vote: \u201cDespite Russia\u2019s growing economic difficulties, public disappointment with Putin hasn\u2019t yet reached a level which would allow Navalny to be viewed by Russians as a genuine alternative. And this process will take years, rather than the mere months left until the elections. Time is on Putin\u2019s side.\u201d\u000a\u000aCAMPAIGN FOOT SOLDIERS\u000a\u000aolkov\u2019s place at the helm of Navalny\u2019s quixotic campaign almost didn\u2019t happen. In 2013, he nearly gave up on politics entirely.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter the mayoral campaign, I made the conscious decision to return to IT,\u201d he said. \u201cI told myself, \u2018I\u2019m an IT professional. I don\u2019t need any of this.\u2019 I thought there would never be anything as amazing as the mayoral campaign again in my life, and I was ready to come to terms with this. I wanted to grow professionally and earn money, so I moved to Luxembourg to work in IT.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had already started to reconsider his decision when the murder of Boris Nemtsov, the opposition politician gunned down within sight of the Kremlin walls, convinced him to plunge once more into the uncertain waters of Russian politics.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter Nemtsov\u2019s murder, I stopped trying to combine political and business projects and resigned from my day job,\u201d he said. \u201cThey murdered him on February 27, 2015, and March 15 was my last day in IT.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he returned to Russia in 2015, Volkov told an opposition rally that he \u201cwants to be in power.\u201d But although Navalny\u2019s star is on the rise, Volkov insisted he has given no thought to any role he would play if the Kremlin\u2019s most bitter domestic foe eventually wins the presidency. \u201cSeriously,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about this at all.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite his professed love of calm, Volkov also has something of a reputation for controversy, frequently lashing out verbally against critics, and what he calls the \u201clow-down cynicism\u201d inherent in Russian politics. A pet hate is the generation of liberal politicians from the 1990s, in particular Russia\u2019s oldest opposition party, Yabloko, which Volkov has at times accused of political cowardice and collaboration with the authorities.\u000a\u000aSuch outbursts, as well as his undisguised loathing for Kremlin-connected officials, could cause serious problems for the campaign, some political observers say.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor Navalny, it\u2019s extremely important that his chief of staff is a person who is able to compromise, and widen his support within the liberal opposition, as well as increase the number of people within the Moscow political elite that he can hold a dialogue with,\u201d said Alexei Chesnakov, a political consultant who is also a former member of the Kremlin administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut Volkov is quite a scandalous person, prone to making harsh statements,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Volkov continues to behave like this, Navalny\u2019s situation will only deteriorate.\u201d\u000a\u000aNavalny\u2019s campaign effort at the 2013 mayoral election was staffed by thousands of mainly young Muscovites, many of whom were experiencing their first taste of politics. These volunteers quickly gained a reputation for political fanaticism, often subjecting Navalny\u2019s critics to a barrage of personal abuse and online insults. Their zeal led Stanislav Belkovsky, a former Kremlin insider turned opposition supporter, to dub them \u201cNavalny\u2019s Witnesses.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf Russia had a genuine political system, then we would be a moderate center-right party, with a strong left-wing slant on issues concerning personal values and freedoms\u201d \u2014 Leonid Volkov\u000a\u000aThis time around, the majority of Navalny\u2019s young supporters appear equally committed to the cause. But the first cracks are starting to show.\u000a\u000aThis month, Alexander Turovsky, a campaign volunteer in Moscow, lashed out at Navalny after being injured by police. When he left the hospital, Turovsky accused the opposition leader of \u201cignoring\u201d him. He also announced he was quitting the campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor him, we are just foot soldiers, resources that he can sacrifice for the sake of his political battle,\u201d he wrote in a much-discussed social media post. Volkov insisted the campaign had offered Turovsky every possible support, including lawyers, and voiced suspicions that the volunteer had come under \u201cterrible pressure\u201d from the authorities to write the post. Others criticized Turovsky for handing state media valuable ammunition in its efforts to discredit Navalny. Whatever the truth, it was the first real publicity crisis of the campaign.\u000a\u000aRIGHT TO BE RUSSIAN\u000a\u000aart of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to neutralize Navalny has been an often-laughable attempt to portray him as a bloodthirsty Nazi. In 2013, a hysterical state television report compared him to Adolf Hitler. And earlier this year, amid reports that the Kremlin had created a special department to deal with the threat posed by Navalny\u2019s presidential campaign, a video appeared on YouTube again depicting him as an unhinged, fascist demagogue set upon violent insurrection.\u000a\u000aNavalny is, of course, no Nazi. But like much of the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda, the far-right allegations were not simply plucked from thin air.\u000a\u000aUp until 2011, when he first emerged as a major opposition figure, Navalny regularly spoke at the Russian March, an annual gathering of nationalist and far-right groups in Moscow. Navalny said his participation in the rally was an attempt to \u201cnormalize\u201d the debate about illegal immigration and prevent the nationalist gathering from being hijacked by Sieg Heil-ing youths.\u000a\u000aBut the insurgent\u2019s involvement with nationalism goes back further. In 2008, he appeared in a video dressed as a dentist, with an on-screen caption describing him as a \u201cfully-trained nationalist,\u201d and compared illegal immigrants to rotten teeth that needed to be \u201ccarefully but forcibly removed\u201d from Russia.\u000a\u000a\u201cA nationalist is a person who doesn\u2019t want the Russian roots to be removed from the word \u2018Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the right to be Russian in Russia and we are defending that right.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Navalny offered public support to rioters who were demanding the expulsion of Chechens from a town in southern Russia. He also sought to justify the nationalist violence that engulfed a region south of Moscow after the murder of an ethnic Russian by an Azerbaijani national later that same year. This month, he used a controversial debate with Igor Girkin, a former Russian security services officer who played a major role in the early days of the war in Ukraine, to reiterate his nationalist credentials.\u000a\u000aVolkov, on the other hand, has never been associated with Russia\u2019s nationalist movement. \u201cI never went on the Russian March, because I\u2019m very distant from that kind of ideology,\u201d he said. He admitted he \u201coften argues\u201d with Navalny about politics, but firmly rejected suggestions the opposition leader\u2019s history of involvement with nationalist politics is a source of tension within the campaign. He admitted, however, that Navalny has had problems in trying to explain exactly what he was trying to accomplish.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know we have to force the authorities to register our candidate, force them to let us promote his candidacy normally, and force them to count the votes properly\u201d \u2014 Leonid Volkov\u000a\u000a\u201cNavalny tried, unsuccessfully in my opinion, to explain that there is nothing bad or shameful about being a nationalist when this means defending the rights of Russian-speaking people,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis explanations satisfy me entirely,\u201d he said, growing suddenly animated and closing his laptop.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a huge number of people in power in Russia who are actual, genuine fascists. People in the Kremlin who believe in the protocols of the Elders of Zion, and so on. Today\u2019s Russia is a typical fascist corporate state that is practically indistinguishable from Mussolini\u2019s Italy with its state propaganda, control over the education of schoolchildren, and so on. And these people, these genuine fascists, are trying to convince people, especially Russia\u2019s liberal intelligentsia, that if Navalny is a nationalist, then he can\u2019t be a liberal, or for democratic values. This is nonsense.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust look at our political program,\u201d Volkov said. \u201cSure, it has some moderately right-wing ideas, such as the imposition of a visa regime for people from Central Asia. But if Russia had a genuine political system, then we would be a moderate center-right party, with a strong left-wing slant on issues concerning personal values and freedoms.\u000a\u000a\u201cLike the U.S. Democrats, we are for gay marriage, unlimited freedom of speech, and for the legalization of soft drugs. But on economic issues, on the political compass, we would be moderate Republicans. We are for less state interference, lowering taxes, the privatization of state companies, and so on.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt times, Navalny\u2019s modern political campaign can seem like something from an alternative Russian reality: This, perhaps, is how election bids would be carried out here, if Putin had never come to power. If Russia\u2019s fledging, post-Soviet democracy had not been crushed. But Volkov is under no illusions about the difficulties ahead.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are running the campaign in the full awareness of what country we are living in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we have to force the authorities to register our candidate, force them to let us promote his candidacy normally, and force them to count the votes properly.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarc Bennetts is a Moscow-based journalist and author of \u201cI\u2019m Going to Ruin Their Lives: Inside Putin\u2019s War on Russia\u2019s Opposition\u201d (Oneworld, 2016).

aVIn Congress the dam finally broke last week: With the death of the Republican health care bill, Senate Democrats allowed dozens of nominees and bills to pass before lawmakers all scattered for August recess. Even the White House had a relatively quiet week as his new chief of staff, John Kelly, became acquainted with his new job and imposed new rules around the Oval Office.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump, as usual, couldn\u2019t keep out of the headlines: Transcripts of his January phone conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico leaked to the media and he held a campaign-style rally in West Virginia on Thursday night. Outside the West Wing, Trump\u2019s agencies had a busy week\u2014again, largely out of the spotlight. The Department of Homeland Security took a step toward building a border wall; the State Department moved toward \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of visa applicants. Plus, the Food and Drug Administration had a surprise announcement on tobacco products. Here\u2019s what you need to know this week about how Trump really is changing policy in America:\u000a\u000a1. DHS waives laws to help build a border wall\u000a\u000aCongress doesn\u2019t appear very interested in funding Trump\u2019s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Republicans, for instance, introduced a $15 billion border security bill this week\u2014and none of that money was earmarked for the wall. Democrats are refusing to vote for any bill that includes border wall money.\u000a\u000aBut the Trump administration is continuing to take steps to build an actual, physical wall. On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice that it was waiving more than three dozen environmental laws in order to build border wall prototypes along a 15-mile border in the vicinity of San Diego, California. The waived laws include the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water, and the Antiquities Act, freeing the government from costly regulations like environmental reviews. The notice is still a small move, since the department has only about $20 million to construct the prototypes\u2014money repurposed from other accounts. But it\u2019s another signal that Trump isn\u2019t backing down from his wall.\u000a\u000a2. Trump targets a major financial regulation\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, a law intended to protect consumers, tighten up oversight of banks and prevent another deep recession. Republicans for years have complained that the law was unduly harsh, discouraging banks from lending and contributing to the slow economic recovery.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Trump administration took a first step to reforming a major component of the law, known as \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d which prevents banks from risking depositors\u2019 money on certain speculative investments. The Office Comptroller of the Currency, an independent agency currently run by Acting Director Keith Noreika, who Trump appointed in May, requested comments on revising the Volcker Rule, a clear sign that he intends to change the underlying regulation.\u000a\u000aThis won\u2019t be a quick process: Dodd-Frank was passed in July, 2010 and the final Volcker Rule wasn\u2019t released until December, 2013. Despite its seeming straightforward nature, the rule is incredibly complicated, running 272 pages and crafted by four agencies, along with the OCC. Any changes to the rule will require approval from those other agencies\u2014the Federal Reserve, SEC, FDIC and CFTC. Still, the OCC\u2019s notice is a clear message to Wall Street: a new cop is on the beat.\u000a\u000a3. A setback for the Department of Education\u000a\u000aSometimes rolling back Obama\u2019s legacy is harder than expected. In May, Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, announced that the Education Department would select a single company to service the agency\u2019s $1.2 trillion portfolio of student loans. The Obama administration had intended to spread different aspects of loan management\u2014such as consolidation, financial reporting, and default\u2014among multiple companies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe move sparked an immediate backlash from Democrats, and some Republicans, who said competition was needed to ensure that servicers had the best interest of students at heart. This week, DeVos abandoned those plans, cancelling a solicitation for bids to manage the loan portfolio. The agency will now seek a new \u201cmore innovative approach\u201d to managing the portfolio and is collecting feedback on how to do so. The reversal is a lesson for the Trump administration that Obama\u2019s regulatory legacy is not always so easy to tear down.\u000a\u000a4. State Department begins \u201cextreme vetting\u201d rule\u000a\u000aMuch of Trump\u2019s March executive order preventing people from six Muslim countries from entering the United States remains blocked by the courts. But the Trump administration is moving forward with the parts of it that aren\u2019t blocked.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the State Department published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting comments on its proposal to begin the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d that Trump promised in his campaign. The agency intends to collect a wide array of information on a \u201csubset of visa applicants,\u201d including their travel, address and employment histories, names of siblings and children and social media information. The proposal requires more information from applicants than the current visa application but doesn\u2019t represent a radical departure from past department practices. The agency is accepting comments for 60 days and will issue a final decision soon thereafter.\u000a\u000a5. The FDA makes a mixed move on tobacco\u000a\u000aIn May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration in a landmark move imposed the first real rules on electronic cigarettes, banning their sale to people under the age of 18 and requiring companies to apply to the FDA for approval of the product. Democrats cheered the announcement for instituting long-overdue oversight of the industry while Republicans said it was misguided, potentially causing Americans to smoke regular cigarettes over the electronic versions.\u000a\u000aUnder the FDA\u2019s original rule, companies with markets currently on the market had two years to apply to the agency to market e-cigarettes and premium cigars. Earlier this year, the FDA extended that deadline by three months. Now, new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is postponing that deadline for five years, effectively killing it for Trump\u2019s entire first term.\u000a\u000aThat looked like a rollback of tobacco restrictions\u2014but at the same time, the agency said it would examine whether to lower the amount of nicotine in traditional cigarettes, a surprise announcement that worried the tobacco industry. The dual changes split the traditional party-line approach to tobacco regulation\u2014Democrats in favor of it, Republicans against\u2014and are sure to set up a knockdown fight with the industry if the FDA really does decide to reduce nicotine levels. Stay tuned.\u000a\u000a(And yes, we know\u2014the announcement didn\u2019t really come this week, but it was so late last Friday afternoon that it didn\u2019t make our deadline for last week\u2019s list.)

But officials from allied countries say Russia increasingly sees Hungary as an operational backdoor into Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is tremendous concern that Russia is basically using Hungary as an intel forward operating base in NATO and the EU,\u201d said a former official at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aWestern officials say Russian intelligence agencies have boosted their presence over the past few years in Hungary, which is a member of Europe\u2019s border-free Schengen zone, to launch a variety of intelligence and sabotage operations in the EU.\u000a\u000a\u201cBack in 2014-2015 [the Russians] went from maybe 50-100 intelligence officers up to 300 plus\u201d in Hungary, said the former embassy official.\u000a\u000a\u201cGenerally we expect they are openly capturing telecoms, running HUMINT [human intelligence] sources all over Europe, planning and staging all kinds of cyber sabotage, linking up with organized crime and supporting folks in parties like [the far-right] Jobbik with fat sacks of cash and maybe even some intel-sourced dirt,\u201d this person added.\u000a\u000aStrategically located\u000a\u000aLocated on NATO\u2019s eastern edge and bordering Ukraine, Hungary is considered an important component of the alliance\u2019s eastern defense strategy. Allied troops are currently training in Hungary as part of NATO\u2019s 10-day Saber Guardian exercises.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone thinks Hungary is compromised\u201d \u2014 Western NATO employee during part of Orbán\u2019s term\u000a\u000aWith Hungarian troops deployed in Kosovo and Afghanistan and a brigade currently training in Estonia, policymakers in Budapest often make the case that regardless of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán\u2019s friendliness with the Kremlin, Hungary at its core is a dedicated NATO ally.\u000a\u000aOrbán has vowed to boost defense spending, with the goal of it reaching 2 percent of GDP by 2024. All NATO countries have committed to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense, although only five member countries currently do so \u2014 a matter U.S. President Donald Trump has highlighted in an effort to get European allies to boost their contribution to the organization.\u000a\u000a\u201cNATO policy is an exception in Hungarian politics, it\u2019s been consistent,\u201d regardless of any government\u2019s ideology, said one current Hungarian official, who declined to be identified.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have never felt like I\u2019m not taken seriously\u201d by NATO partners, he said, adding that \u201cHungary is quite active\u201d in contributing intelligence to alliance members, especially on Ukraine and the Western Balkans.\u000a\u000aIn the alliance\u2019s Brussels headquarters, some officials try to highlight the country\u2019s positive efforts. \u201cHungary contributes a lot to the alliance\u201d within the constraints of its limited resources, said one NATO official. The country \u201cplays a key role in strengthening NATO\u2019s defense in the eastern part of the alliance,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aBut among some of their partners, the Hungarian government and security apparatus are regarded as untrustworthy.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone thinks Hungary is compromised,\u201d said one Westerner who worked for NATO during part of the Orbán years. \u201cI was told not to share anything classified with Hungarians, even if they had the appropriate clearance,\u201d this person said.\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian government, in response to questions from POLITICO, denied that there are any concerns about Russian operations in Hungary.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018special relationship\u2019 between Russia and Hungary,\u201d a spokesman for the government wrote, adding that \u201cthe Hungarian intelligence services fulfill of all their duties regardless of the nature or origin of any given issue.\u201d\u000a\u000aRussia ties\u000a\u000aSince coming to office in 2010, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has reached out to Moscow, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently and sealing a deal for a \u20ac10 billion Russian loan for the Paks II nuclear power plant project.\u000a\u000aIn late 2016, Hungarian online news portal Index reported that a far-right paramilitary leader, who was accused of shooting a police officer, had for years been meeting with Russian intelligence personnel \u2014 on Hungarian territory. Members of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence, have developed relationships with several far-right Hungarian groups, according to the Index report. Some Russian diplomats, moreover, participated in airsoft \u2014 a sport that uses non-lethal equipment resembling guns \u2014 with far-right activists while Hungarian intelligence services turned a blind eye, the report said.\u000a\u000aSuspected Russian intelligence operations have also impacted Hungarians directly. In April, online news portal 444.hu reported that the government\u2019s national consultation website \u2014 where Hungarians were asked to answer a series of questions on their personal views \u2014 used a tracking code belonging to Russian firm Yandex, which forwarded Hungarians\u2019 data to a server in Russia. Hungary\u2019s National Data Protection Agency, under pressure from critics who say Yandex is bound by Russian law to share information with Russian security services if asked, later announced it would investigate any potential mishandling of Hungarians\u2019 personal data, which the government had originally assured users would not be shared with foreign third parties.\u000a\u000aSome Hungarians, meanwhile, see Western critics as simply hypocritical.\u000a\u000aSome Hungarian intelligence professionals are concerned that the Orbán government is leaving Hungary vulnerable to Russian operations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we just look at the past six months, we see obvious Russian activities that cannot be explained in a normal NATO or EU member state,\u201d Ferenc Katrein, a former director of counterespionage and counterterrorism operations at Hungary\u2019s civilian counterintelligence agency, told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aHe pointed to cases like the national consultation website\u2019s forwarding of Hungarians\u2019 personal information to a Russian server and the recent intimidation of an opposition activist in Budapest by a Chechen who, according to some Hungarian media reports, threatened the activist with the encouragement of a Russian diplomat.\u000a\u000aThe frequent appearance of stories from Russian state media in Hungarian state-owned outlets and media close to the ruling party has also raised questions about the relationship between Budapest and Moscow.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the official Hungarian media is constantly attacking the allies, there is no criticism of the Russians \u2026 This contradiction is telling,\u201d said Katrein.\u000a\u000aBilateral military-to-military information-sharing with Western allies \u201calmost evaporated\u201d after Orbán was elected in 2010, said Gy\u0151z\u0151 Zakariás, a retired Hungarian army colonel who has studied the challenges facing Hungary\u2019s armed forces.\u000a\u000aSome Western officials say the Orbán government is allowing Russian activity to go unchecked for political reasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Hungarians are tracking [Russian activity] and aren\u2019t exactly thrilled either, but our read was that Hungarian officials don\u2019t believe they can kick them all out without provoking Russia,\u201d said the former U.S. Embassy official.\u000a\u000aSome Hungarians, meanwhile, see Western critics as simply hypocritical.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we think, we say, and that\u2019s unusual in international politics,\u201d said the Hungarian official, adding that many NATO members are in constant communication with the Kremlin but are simply not as open about their ties.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone doubts for a moment that it\u2019s in Hungary\u2019s interest to be part of NATO,\u201d said Eleni Kounalakis, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary between 2010 and 2013.\u000a\u000a\u201cOrbán doesn\u2019t want Russian influence in Hungary,\u201d she said.

aVPresident Trump is making America\u2019s mayors really nervous.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the takeaway from a new Politico Magazine survey of city leaders who, ever since Election Day, have been frantically trying to figure out what the arrival of a Trump administration means for them and their constituents. What\u2019s got the nation\u2019s urban executives so worried? Start with the new president\u2019s threat to repeal Obamacare. Three-quarters of the predominantly Democratic mayors who responded to the survey say it would be \u201ca complete disaster\u201d for their cities. How about affordable housing? Nearly two-thirds consider it a priority in their cities, but they don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s pick for head of Housing and Urban Development is up to the job. Education? Mayors are almost unanimous in their support for universal pre-kindergarten, but they haven\u2019t heard a peep out of the administration on a subject they say is vital to creating a 21st century workforce. Even where the mayors and the 45th president find some common ground, such as their mutual desire for major investment in infrastructure, the mayors expressed conspicuous doubt that the political newcomer will deliver on his ambitious promises.\u000a\u000aAnd all that angst and skepticism came before Trump took a shot at cities with his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d line in his inaugural speech, vowed to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities and possibly \u201csend in the feds\u201d to Chicago if the city couldn\u2019t get a handle on its violent crime.\u000a\u000aIn the eighth installment of Politico Magazine\u2019s mayors survey, part of the award-winning What Works series, we asked mayors in the two weeks before the inauguration to forecast how their cities would fare under the incoming Trump administration. Forty-six mayors responded to the unscientific and anonymous survey, from big cities such as Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle and Philadelphia; college towns like Madison, Wisconsin, Knoxville, Tennessee and New Haven, Connecticut; and rapidly expanding urban centers like Austin, Texas and Asheville, North Carolina. The participants were largely Democrat, (42 Democrats and four Republicans), mirroring the predominantly Democratic cast of America\u2019s city halls.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I understand that you have many priorities, Mr. President,\u201d judiciously said one mayor who is focused on neighborhood revitalization, \u201cplease do not neglect urban centers and inner cities in your policy agenda.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut most mayors expressed great concern that far from forgetting them, Trump was in fact targeting them. The collective frustration laced through the survey responses reflects the mayors\u2019 mounting anger that Trump has used their cities as a punching bag during his campaign to appeal to rural voters. That view was not softened during his tumultuous transition and his equally volatile first week in office, which culminated with a sweeping ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can\u2019t help cities advance progressive policies, then just leave us alone,\u201d Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said. \u201cDon\u2019t punish cities for our immigration policies because you want to please your base by pretending to do something about immigration reform. Just actually do smart immigration reform and then cities won\u2019t have to have distinct immigration policies in the first place. And, dear god, stop tweeting.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut the impact of Trump\u2019s raft of executive orders is already being felt in America\u2019s cities, exposing conflicts between city halls and the Oval Office that are likely to dominate the next four, or even eight years. Last week, Trump followed up on his campaign promise to threaten mayors of so-called sanctuary cities\u2014where by law or by practice city officials don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration authorities\u2014with a cutoff of federal funds. At least one mayor capitulated immediately.\u000a\u000aMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told the Miami Herald that his South Florida community did not want to risk losing millions in federal dollars by refusing to comply with the president\u2019s order. While the White House may be constitutionally constrained in other areas, when it comes to sanctuary cities certain federal grant programs can be suspended without a congressional vote. The fear that drove Gimenez to act was reflected clearly in the survey results. Of the mayors who said they had already directed their police not to comply with federal detention orders, more than two-thirds are worried that their coffers might be targeted if they fail to comply with the president\u2019s policy.\u000a\u000aImmigration surged to the top of the news late last week, but the survey (conducted January 9-20) covered a number of other hot-button issues for urban executives\u2014housing, health, education and one that doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention except from budget-conscious mayors: the onerous cost of replacing aging sewer pipes to comply with federal water quality rules. On each subject, there is an evident fault line between mayors, who see their cities as engines of the nation\u2019s long-term economic recovery, and the new occupant of the White House, who routinely spotlights cities as the scene of myriad ills, from violent crime to alleged voter fraud.\u000a\u000aFew issues raise alarms with mayors as loudly as the threatened repeal of Obamacare. Having worked to promote and help implement Obamacare, Democrats now face a president who promised to gut it and a Congress that tried for years to repeal it. For now, Republicans are still trying to figure out their replacement plan and how to phase it in while moving away from former President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. In the meantime, mayors are worried that those without insurance will once again clog their emergency rooms. Three-quarters of mayors surveyed, agreed a repeal would be a \u201ccomplete disaster.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is most divisive because many in my city now have health care for the first time as a family and that is threatened,\u201d one mayor said.\u000a\u000aAnother mayor added: \u201cWe are concerned about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. As a city and state we have worked hard to enroll residents in the ACA, and now have more than 133,000 people covered under the ACA in our city.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to top public health priorities, mayors are less concerned about gun violence, a preoccupation of President Trump when he talks about the nation\u2019s largest cities, than they are about problems such as a lack of health insurance and drug addiction that they see affecting much larger numbers of their constituents. Asked to prioritize the health problems facing their residents, 58 percent said drugs (such as opioids) and 54 percent said a lack of insurance. Gun violence was tied with obesity at 34 percent. That\u2019s not the way Trump is looking at their world. During a speech January 26 to congressional Republicans in Philadelphia, Trump incorrectly asserted that the City of Brotherly Love has experienced an increase in homicides. In fact, such crimes have for the most part been steadily decreasing over the past decade.\u000a\u000aMayors are also wary about the president\u2019s Cabinet picks who will have the most impact on what transpires in their cities. As one mayor put it, \u201c\u2026 his Cabinet appointments seem unqualified. They do not have the same level of sophistication as previous administrations.\u201d Despite passing the Senate\u2019s Banking Committee unanimously, mayors see the combination of Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who Trump tapped to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as harmful to their agenda. While 80 percent see the goal of creating affordable housing as a high priority, nearly two-thirds of those who responded see Carson and Trump causing some or major harm in that area.\u000a\u000aWhile they\u2019re not opposed to charter schools, of Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, 89 percent think it should be part of the education mix. But they are much more focused on issues like universal pre-kindergarten, which 85 percent of them consider essential to preparing their workforce for 21st century jobs. However, universal Pre-K is not on Trump or DeVos\u2019 list of policy priorities. Not surprisingly, mayors have cheered the president\u2019s interest in investing as much as $1 trillion in new infrastructure and repairing failing bridges and highways. But despite the possibility of this much needed investment, only 9 percent are very or mostly optimistic that Trump will deliver on his promise\u2014while half of the mayors who responded are not very or not at all optimistic.\u000a\u000aPerhaps part of the reason mayors are so pessimistic is that the $1 trillion bill the president and his aides have talked about would require congressional approval. The president\u2019s own party has demonstrated thus far that is focused on other early priorities, such as gutting Obamacare and cutting taxes. The two parties also have deep philosophical differences on an infrastructure plan, with Trump\u2019s team pushing a tax-credit heavy package to spur private investment and Democrats seeking direct spending akin to Obama\u2019s stimulus plan.\u000a\u000aMayors have their own ideas about how to fund the desperately needed work. In one of the areas with the broadest support in the entire survey, 85 percent of mayors said Congress should raise the national gas tax to pay for infrastructure improvements. Republicans are in virtual lock step against raising taxes of any sort. The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not been raised since Bill Clinton was in the White House. (Adjusted for inflation, the tax per gallon would be roughly 30 cents now.) Since 2008, the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s annual needs have outpaced what the tax can generate. In 2015, Congress allocated $70 billion from the Treasury\u2019s general fund over the next five years, which the Congressional Budget Office views as a temporary patch for a problem that will re-emerge once the dollars run out. But despite the resounding support for an increase, mayors couldn\u2019t find consensus on just how large it should be. A little more than a third of them backed a 15-cent bump and another third said an additional 50 cents was appropriate.\u000a\u000aMayors also weighed in on an obscure issue that some of them say is one of the biggest impediments to their city\u2019s growth: combined sewer overflow. In older cities, sewers carrying storm water and raw sewage are combined and during heavy storms backups can cause chemicals and waste to contaminate waterways. By federal environmental law, cities are required to put in costly mitigation measures and those costs are trickling down to small businesses. Mayors don\u2019t want to undo the regulations\u2014they know how important clean water is to their city\u2019s health\u2014but they do want help offsetting the cost of compliance.\u000a\u000aThe general economic outlook is still optimistic from inside city hall. Nearly three-quarters of mayors are as optimistic or more optimistic about their city\u2019s economic outlook compared with six months ago. But that number reflects a steady decrease in optimism since the beginning of the presidential cycle. In August 2016, 74 percent of mayors said they were equally optimistic or more optimistic than they were a half-year earlier.\u000a\u000aMayors increasingly see themselves as a bulwark against the federal government. City halls are some of the last levers the Democratic Party holds in national politics, having previously lost control of Congress, state legislatures and governorships in record numbers.\u000a\u000aBruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Brookings Institution, sees some similarities between the current adversarial climate and the Reagan administration when a series of cutbacks to cities were rolled out. But mayors, he said, occupy a more independent role now than they did in the 80s.\u000a\u000a\u201cMayors as political leaders are playing a very different role [than during Reagan\u2019s time],\u201d he said. \u201cIn many respects, they have become really essentially leaders not just around their formal powers \u2026 but really around a whole set of issues whether it is around education, whether it is around climate change, whether it is around infrastructure or innovation.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen asked what they would tell the president, mayors largely asked the president to listen to them and to work together, but they are also deeply concerned that Trump\u2019s priorities conflict with their own visions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe biggest flashpoint? Everything. Donald Trump's agenda relies on cities and our people to be weakened for his, Pence's, and Bannon's brand of authoritarianism, nationalism, and white supremacy to take root and grow,\u201d one mayor said. \u201cThey will use every lever of the federal government they can to compel us into fascism, and cities will have to fight that for the survival of our people and of our democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aPARTICIPATING MAYORS (46): C.

aVThe endless saga to repeal and replace Obamacare now playing out in Congress is causing deep anxiety among an overwhelming majority of America\u2019s mayors, 86 percent of whom say they are \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d that doing away with the insurance program would leave their citizens more vulnerable to health crises like opioid addiction and obesity.\u000a\u000aAnd a majority doubt that President Trump, who made dismantling the signature policy of the previous administration one of his top campaign promises, has a clear plan to replace Obamacare if Congress manages to repeal it. If they had their way, most say they would prefer a single-payer plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt seems unlikely that the President has any significant understanding of, or interest in health policy,\u201d said Democratic Mayor Noam Bramson of New Rochelle, NY. \u201cHe will support whatever plan (if any) emerges from the Republican Congress and declare it a \u2018win.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aChief among the mayors\u2019 concerns are potential cuts to Medicaid, which, under most of the proposed, but so far unsuccessful replacement plans circulating on Capitol Hill, would cut the deficit by $473 billion and leave more than 20 million people uninsured within a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Sixty percent of mayors said Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has been \u201cvery important\u201d to their cities. And mayors were nearly unanimous in their concern (95 percent said they were either \u201cvery or moderately concerned\u201d) that any cuts to Medicaid would exacerbate the opioid crisis that plagues so much of America.\u000a\u000aFifty-seven mayors participated in the anonymous and non-scientific survey, the tenth in POLITICO Magazine\u2019s award-winning What Works series. Just under 80 percent of mayors who responded to the survey in the 10 days after the July 4 holiday, were Democrats, a response that matches the generally liberal tilt of city halls across the country. Six of the 57 surveyed are Republican, while four identified as non-partisan or independent.\u000a\u000aThough the outcome of the Congressional maneuvering remains in doubt, mayors aren\u2019t sitting idle in their executive suites waiting for the hatchet to drop. Mayors on average estimated that between 75 and 80 percent of their residents have health insurance; they expect that a repeal of the ACA would cut that number by over 10 percentage points. That\u2019s not a prospect they take lightly.\u000a\u000aMost mayors are trying to stave off disaster by lobbying their congressional delegation. Many are mobilizing either constituents or local non-profits. A few are taking more creative approaches. One city has already created a small fund in case of federal cuts. Another city has proposed a $50 million reserve in its budget to soften the impact of more uninsured citizens.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aA majority of mayors believe the real solution to the nation\u2019s health care mess is one that Congress isn\u2019t even contemplating: a single-payer system. Nearly two-thirds said a single-payer plan offered in their state \u201csounds better than the current system.\u201d A handful would only support adopting single-payer if Congress repeals Obamacare. Eleven of the 57 mayors surveyed said they didn\u2019t think an entirely government-funded plan \u201cwould work in my city.\u201d\u000a\u000aSingle-payer is an issue that unites Democrats from the most progressive to the most conservative. In California, state lawmakers are pushing a $400-billion-per-year single-payer bill for the state\u2019s 40 million residents that relies predominantly on state and federal funds currently dedicated to Medicare and Medicaid services. Trump said publicly Wednesday that a nationwide single-payer program would \u201cbankrupt\u201d the U.S. and force citizens to \u201cwait in line for weeks to see a doctor.\u201d On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated that single-payer could be a centerpiece of a bolder economic fairness message from the Democrats.\u000a\u000aGenerally, the mayors surveyed were not placated by the Senate GOP\u2019s attempt to compensate for Medicaid cuts by sending $45 billion to states especially plagued by the opioid epidemic. In fact, two-thirds of mayors also said the most helpful thing to tackle to opioid crisis would be more funding for treatment programs not less. A dozen mayors want more regulations to prevent over-prescription by doctors.\u000a\u000aThe Kaiser Foundation estimates that over 90 Americans die per day from overdosing on opioids such as heroin and prescription painkillers. The ubiquity of opioid use and dependency costs the U.S. an estimated $78.5 billion per year and has prompted action in cities across the country. For example, residents of Baltimore (whose mayor did not participate in the survey) were issued a blanket prescription for the overdose antidote by the city health department in 2015.\u000a\u000aWhile mayors are predominantly worried about opioids, mayors also said obesity and gun violence (roughly a fifth of those surveyed for each) were the major health concerns in their cities. A few named viruses such as HIV and Zika as his or her city\u2019s biggest health epidemic.\u000a\u000aApproximately one-third of adults and one-sixth of children in the U.S. are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Under Obamacare, insurers are banned from charging people more or denying coverage because of existing medical conditions, including obesity. Under the latest Senate GOP proposal, that would remain law. But the latest Senate bill would change the Obamacare mandate to now allow states to waive insurance rules, such as minimum contributions insurers must pay toward medical bills.\u000a\u000aSix months ago, Trump\u2019s Obamacare repeal rhetoric had mayors openly fearing catastrophe. Since then, the position of city bosses doesn\u2019t seem to have shifted. The vast majority of mayors are skeptical of the president\u2019s promise of a \u201cgreat\u201d Obamacare alternative that will \u201cend in a beautiful picture.\u201d Mayor Walter Campbell of Coral Springs, Florida believes the administration is dangerously \u201cwinging it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump promised Wednesday that any GOP healthcare replacement would give coverage to low-income citizens and maintain coverage for pre-existing conditions. He claimed the latest draft of the bill would allow insurance purchases across state lines. He also said that he wanted to let Obamacare fail and that he didn\u2019t want to \u201cown it\u201d when it did.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt appears that the current leadership did not expect to be in a situation where they would actually have to vote on a \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 bill,\u201d said Democratic Mayor Helene Schneider of Santa Barbara, California. \u201cNow they are acting like the dog who finally caught the bus and don't know what to do with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublican Mayor Acquanetta Warren of Fontana, California was one of the few surveyed who believe there is a plan. She said the president wants to move federal government \u201cout of the way\u201d and let states tackle health care based on their own needs\u2014something Trump has explicitly pushed for. \u201cIf [you are] in California that's scary based on our legislative climate,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe biggest mistake Trump made was promising to \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 Obamacare instead of simply \u2018fixing\u2019 it,\u201d said Mayor Paul Dyster, a Democrat, of Niagara Falls. \u201cIf he had done that instead, there would still have been fierce debate on both philosophical and technical issues, but he would have found many Dems eager to help \u2018make improvements.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile most mayors think Trump\u2019s biggest healthcare priority should be either keeping Obamacare in place, further expanding Medicaid or making healthcare more accessible and affordable, a handful want him to prioritize the fight against the opioid crisis. Others suggested infrastructure spending to include parks and walking or biking paths. Some said the administration should allow insurance purchases across state lines, make Medicaid reimbursement rates competitive with neighboring states, or adopt universal or single-payer coverage. Some prioritized increasing preventative care, housing and behavioral health services. One mayor simply suggested the administration should prioritize bipartisanship. "All factions should have a voice in the creation of a comprehensive health care plan," he said.\u000a\u000aOver a third of mayors think they should help their residents individually adopt healthier lifestyles, especially to combat obesity. Youth access to sports, smoking cessation, cleaner diets and expanding pedestrian forms of transportation were all repeatedly listed. More affordable and accessible healthcare was second on the list. Tackling gun violence and the opioid epidemic were each mentioned by several mayors as top priorities in their cities. So was combatting lead poisoning. One red-state mayor said shutting down their city\u2019s coal plant would foremost improve residents\u2019 health.\u000a\u000aAnxiety over health care is tempered somewhat by a generally rosier outlook on the economy. Mayors said they feel better about their city\u2019s economy now than they did six months ago: 88 percent feel either more or equally optimistic about their city compared to the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Unemployment has dropped several tenths of a percent to 4.4 percent since late January \u2013 the lowest it\u2019s been in a decade. This optimism is a notable increase from the most recent survey in April, when less than 70 percent of surveyed mayors reported equal or increased optimism. In January, that number was about three-quarters.\u000a\u000aMost attribute their city\u2019s economic state to either normal factors beyond presidential control or work by the previous administration. Only two believe measures enacted by the Trump administration account for the change.\u000a\u000aMayors who participated include: Denny Doyle, Beaverton, OR; John Marchione, Redmond, WA; Paul Soglin, Madison, WI; Mike T.

aVThe European Medicines Agency, in London | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Eurovision-style contest for prized EU agencies 19 countries apply to host the European Medicines Agency; 8 chase the European Banking Authority.\u000a\u000aLet the horsetrading begin.\u000a\u000aWith two London-based EU agencies up for grabs after Brexit, a highlight of the fall political season in Brussels will be the division of these fat spoils.\u000a\u000aNineteen countries submitted their bids to take the European Medicines Agency and eight put in for the European Banking Authority, the Council of the European Union said on Tuesday. Six would be happy with either agency, though under the rules of this contest they can\u2019t have both.\u000a\u000aThese are economic and prestige prizes for the eventual winner, bringing with them jobs, tax revenues and sudden or additional influence in finance or health policy. The outcome will also show to what degree the old ways of EU decision-making have been changed in this contest, where Brussels set out highly specific criteria and organized a one-country-one-vote ballot.\u000a\u000aThe aspirants put together thick proposals, touting their cities\u2019 charms and carrots. The merits of their cases are supposed to carry the day. But in reality politics will play a significant role, as the 27 countries take part in the EU-old spectacle of vote-trading, geographic balancing and tough compromises \u2014 as always behind closed doors yet with the details sure to leak out.\u000a\u000aThe bigger get is the EMA. The medicines agency, which carries out the highly technical work of evaluating new drugs, has a staff of 890 permanent and 36,000 experts coming in over the course of a year \u2014 and filling up hotels and restaurants \u2014 for meetings. Getting such a cluster of scientific know-how carries other benefits. The proximity of the EMA was a reason cited by big non-EU pharma companies for basing themselves in London, and some are likely to follow the agency to its new host country.\u000a\u000aThe EBA is far smaller, with under 200 staffers. But as one of the EU\u2019s three supervisory financial authorities, it will attract bankers and law firms \u2014 and lots of tax revenue \u2014 to the winning city.\u000a\u000aBig dogs\u000a\u000aOn paper, the EU is running a transparent process. The Commission and Council in June set out relocation criteria, and will now vet each application and present its findings in October to the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union.\u000a\u000aThe 27 remaining EU countries will then choose a winner in up to three rounds of secret voting, using a scoring system that makes the way the Eurovision song contest is decided look simple by comparison. The EMA will be voted on first, followed by the EBA.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s where the politics \u2014 and the drama \u2014 comes in.\u000a\u000aEven though their votes weigh no more than any others\u2019, France and Germany \u2014 the bloc\u2019s big dogs \u2014 are expected to play an outsized role in this decision.\u000a\u000aParis and Berlin put in for both agencies, but to observers that smacked of strategic positioning. The French aren\u2019t considered serious bidders for the EBA (Paris is already home to the securities regulator) and the Germans don\u2019t seem all in for Bonn to host the EMA. But Germany wants Frankfurt, a banking center, to solidify its role as the EU\u2019s post-Brexit financial center by snagging the banking authority, while Lille in France does seriously covet the EMA.\u000a\u000aIn the lead up to Tuesday\u2019s deadline for applications, the French have quietly pooh-poohed the German option for the EBA, touting Brussels instead and saying the agency shouldn\u2019t operate in the shadow of the European Central Bank already in Frankfurt. But there\u2019s speculation Paris could throw its weight behind the Germans \u2014 that is, if Berlin backs Lille\u2019s bid for the EMA, or shows itself more open to French proposals for an EU finance minister, or a mixture of those.\u000a\u000aBy another scenario, the French could be involved in a more complex deal to support Frankfurt for the EBA and an Eastern European country for the EMA in return for an existing French agency, the European Securities and Markets Authority, being strengthened.\u000a\u000aAny number of possible deals have been mooted by curious observers and the players directly involved in this auction.\u000a\u000aFor the record, the EMA candidates are Amsterdam (the Netherlands), Athens (Greece), Barcelona (Spain), Bonn (Germany), Bratislava (Slovakia), Brussels (Belgium), Bucharest (Romania), Copenhagen (Denmark), Dublin (Ireland), Helsinki (Finland), Lille (France), Milan (Italy), Porto (Portugal), Sofia (Bulgaria), Stockholm (Sweden), Valletta (Malta), Vienna (Austria), Warsaw (Poland), Zagreb (Croatia).\u000a\u000aThe eight candidates bidding for the EBA are Brussels (Belgium), Dublin (Ireland), Frankfurt (Germany), Paris (France), Prague (Czech Republic), Luxembourg City (Luxembourg), Vienna (Austria), Warsaw (Poland).\u000a\u000aEBA complexities\u000a\u000aOut of those EBA applicants, Austria, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Poland can make the case on grounds of equity: These countries only have one EU agency. Germany has two, Luxembourg three and Paris four. Brussels, home to all three institutions of the EU, also hosts 15 agencies.\u000a\u000aMaking the EBA decision potentially more interesting, a required review of the EU supervisory agencies released in March proposed that the EBA could be merged with the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, which is located in Frankfurt. France doesn\u2019t formally like this idea.\u000a\u000aWhile some offers sought to attract the EBA with promises of rent-free offices \u2014 up to 25 years, in the case of Vienna \u2014 others appealed to the practical transport needs of employees, or just their desire to find a good beer (Brussels: 1,500 different brands available). Warsaw touted that Poland had \u201cno indigenous terrorism and no known terrorist organizations,\u201d and would offer half price on office rent for a decade. But Poland, which isn\u2019t part of the eurozone, is a longshot for the banking authority.\u000a\u000aWolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, used Frankfurt\u2019s EBA pitch to once again call on London bankers to move to the financial center on the Rhine. \u201cA decision in favor of Frankfurt would ensure the continued success of the EBA\u2019s work,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would be true not just for the EBA but for all financial institutions based in the United Kingdom, which would all be welcome to make Germany their home.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe EMA offers were packed with goodies as well. Jumping the gun by publishing its full proposal Monday, Finland said it would relocate several departments of the agency seven months ahead of Brexit. These include most of the EMA scientific committees, including those for veterinary, orphan and pediatric drugs, as well as manufacturing inspectors. It\u2019s an ambitious plan since the proposed building won\u2019t be fully complete. It would also give the half of staff who have families little time to find schools, houses or jobs for spouses.\u000a\u000aDenmark offered to pay the rent, taxes and service fees for the new EMA building in Copenhagen for 20 years. They also would cover other costs including the payment of the consulting architect to prepare the Copenhagen Towers, the deposit to the lessor and the agency\u2019s share of running costs (such as electricity, water and heating) for the two-decade period.\u000a\u000a\u2018Preference ballots\u2019\u000a\u000aThe vote on the agencies happens in November at the General Affairs Council. Countries can abstain, and they can vote for themselves. In the first round, each country has 6 points. They must give three points to their preferred bid, two to their second choice and one to their third. If no single country secures 14 first preference ballots (a majority of the 27 EU member countries), they move to round two.\u000a\u000aIn the second round, countries vote for one of the three (or more) bids with the highest votes from round one. Each country has one vote, which they must issue to their preferred bid. If no single offer receives 14 or more votes it moves to round three, where countries vote for one of the two remaining offers with the highest votes. The bid with the most votes wins. If there is a tie, the presidency will draw lots.\u000a\u000aThe only precedent dates from 2013 when the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) had to leave the U.K., which did not want to host it anymore. Seven cities applied to host the 60-staff agency: Templemore, Ireland; Veria, Greece; Avila, Spain; Rome; Budapest; The Hague; and Tampere, Finland. The voting took place at a meeting of justice and home affairs ministers in October 2013 and Budapest won.\u000a\u000aFiona Maxwell contributed to this article.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVAndrew Harnik/AP Law And Order Bob Mueller Is Using a Grand Jury. Here\u2019s What It Means.\u000a\u000aThursday\u2019s news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is tapping a grand jury as part of his ongoing investigation jolted Washington and sent pundits to the airwaves, seeking to explain what this latest twist in the Russia story might tell us about President Donald Trump\u2019s ultimate fate.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no doubt this move is significant: It means Mueller believes there is sufficient evidence a crime was committed to warrant a criminal investigation. But people are leaping to conclusions that the public evidence doesn\u2019t yet support.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOnly a grand jury can issue an indictment, which is the only way that someone can be charged with committing a felony pursuant to the U.S. Constitution. Merely impaneling a grand jury does not mean that Mueller will ultimately seek an indictment, although most grand jury investigations do result in someone being indicted. When a prosecutor does seek an indictment, one is almost always returned by the grand jury\u2014hence the old saw that a grand jury would \u201cindict a ham sandwich\u201d if asked.\u000a\u000aA grand jury, which consists of 16 to 23 people, is an important tool that allows prosecutors to issue subpoenas that require people to produce documents and other evidence. Subpoenas can also be used to compel people to testify under oath before the grand jury. You can expect Mueller and his team to issue many subpoenas in the months ahead.\u000a\u000aBecause grand jury subpoenas are an important prosecutorial tool, typically a grand jury is impaneled at the very beginning of an investigation, not at the end. Indictments are usually sought at the very end of an investigation, after all of the witnesses are questioned and all of the documents are obtained. So despite all the punditry on cable news, there\u2019s no suggestion here that Mueller is closing in on any particular target, such as the president. In all likelihood, he\u2019s just getting started.\u000a\u000aIt is possible, though, that as a starting point Mueller will eventually seek an indictment of a lower-level figure in or around Trump\u2019s campaign. Sometimes, when prosecutors are facing obstacles in obtaining evidence, they seek an indictment of one individual or a group of individuals prior to completing their investigation, if they believe that those individuals might cooperate with the government and provide evidence. Otherwise, decisions about who to charge are left to the very end of the investigation.\u000a\u000aThe work that grand juries do is secret, which means that grand jurors\u2014who are ordinary citizens chosen at random and vetted by the federal district court\u2014cannot share what is happening before the grand jury. Federal rules also prevent prosecutors from disclosing what happens before the grand jury. But those same rules permit witnesses to disclose what happened, and people who receive grand jury subpoenas are usually not prohibited from disclosing their contents. That means that we will likely continue to hear media reports about witnesses and documents sought by Mueller and his team, as we did on Thursday.\u000a\u000aOne quirk of grand juries could be significant. When a witness testifies under oath before the grand jury, no one else is permitted to be present other than the prosecutor and the grand jurors. The witness is not even allowed to have a lawyer present, and the normal rules of evidence that limit questioning in a trial do not apply. For that reason, when witnesses receive a grand jury subpoena, their lawyer often asks the prosecutor to agree to permit the witness to be interviewed by the prosecutor and an FBI agent with the lawyer present. The FBI agent\u2019s presence would make it a crime to lie during the interview\u2014creating the risk of Trump or one of his associates committing a crime through their words\u2014but the lawyer would be present and could assist the witness.\u000a\u000aThat said, interviews are not typically transcribed, even though the FBI agent prepares a report memorializing the interview. For that reason, when it is important for a prosecutor to pin down a witness\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor will insist that the witness testify under oath before the grand jury. For example, President Bill Clinton testified before a grand jury in the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2014who later accused Clinton of providing \u201cperjurious, false and misleading testimony,\u201d leading to his impeachment by the Republican-led House of Representatives.\u000a\u000aAs for Trump, we\u2019re probably a long way from learning whether he\u2019s broken any laws, although he very well may be in Mueller\u2019s sights. The fact that a grand jury has been impaneled does not affect whether Mueller will be fired, as the president has threatened to do, and it does not in any way restrict the bounds of his investigation.\u000a\u000aThat said, as a practical matter, the existence of a grand jury investigation confirms that Mueller is conducting a criminal investigation, not merely a counterintelligence investigation. It\u2019s possible that the existence of a federal criminal investigation might increase the political cost of firing Mueller. Republican senators have already warned there will be \u201chell to pay\u201d if Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia investigation has enraged and frustrated the president, so that he can hire a more pliant attorney general.\u000a\u000aThat said, Thursday\u2019s news is not surprising. Mueller has already hired 16 prosecutors\u2014some of the most accomplished investigators ever assembled on one team. These are people with deep skills and experience in prosecuting cases on money laundering, campaign finance violations and foreign bribery, as well as a sophisticated understanding of how to handle sprawling, complex investigations like this one. If any crimes were committed, they\u2019re likely to find out.\u000a\u000aThe evidence in the public domain was already enough to warrant an investigation, which is why Mueller was appointed in the first place. Now, the existence of a grand jury confirms what many of us presumed, which is that Mueller is conducting a wide-ranging criminal investigation. What we don\u2019t know is what, if anything, it will uncover.\u000a\u000aRenato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor who handled many obstruction cases. He is now a partner at Thompson Coburn LLP.

aVThe closure of many Northern European poultry farms is a blow to the industry after last year's avian flu crisis | Robin van Lonkhuijsen/AFP via Getty Images Are Europe\u2019s eggs safe to eat? The toxic chemical fipronil may end up on breakfast platters.\u000a\u000aAuthorities across Northern Europe shut hundreds of poultry farms this week and stopped the sale of millions of eggs as safety inspectors warned that many batches contained a toxic insecticide: fipronil.\u000a\u000aSupermarkets took precautionary measures by withdrawing some cartons, and Aldi in Germany even stopped selling eggs outright. The chemical is completely banned for use on farm animals: Researchers link fipronil to a range of human health problems and point to a particular danger for children.\u000a\u000aChristian Meyer, agriculture minister from Germany\u2019s farm powerhouse of Lower Saxony, warned that the crisis had not reached its peak and told NDR radio that the federal government was downplaying the risks to children.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe German federal minister is denying the health threats and speaks of an average German consumption,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIf a child only eats as many eggs as Germans eat on average per month, then that would not be dangerous. But if the child eats \u2026 one egg a day, then there\u2019s already a breach of the acute threat level for children regarding that poison \u2014 so you see I believe we have to state clearly that there is a possible threat to children\u2019s health.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe full scale of the problem is still unclear as results of Belgian and German tests are expected in the coming days. It also remains to be seen whether the scandal is limited to eggs, or whether fipronil will transpire to be a risk in cakes and pasta too, as well as chicken itself.\u000a\u000aIn Belgium and the Netherlands, criminal investigations are under way. Investigators suspect a small company in Flanders called Poultry Vision concocted an illegal fipronil detergent to treat mite-infested chickens, unintentionally sparking an international food safety scandal.\u000a\u000aThe scandal comes as yet another hammer blow to Europe\u2019s poultry sector, which was hit by a devastating bout of avian influenza last year that meant many farmers lost the ability to sell their eggs as free-range.\u000a\u000aThis is what we know so far about the potential risks from the egg crisis:\u000a\u000aHow did this all start?\u000a\u000aOn July 22, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it placed seven poultry companies under investigation after finding fipronil in a batch of eggs. It said at the time that there was \u201cno immediate danger to public health.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe issue exploded into a major scandal this week. The NVWA closed 180 farms \u2014 which together produce some 40 million eggs a week \u2014 and said it had found one farm producing such high levels of fipronil that they posed an \u201cacute danger to public health.\u201d The Netherlands warned on Thursday that eggs from 59 producers should not be served to children.\u000a\u000aHow do Belgium and Germany evaluate the risk?\u000a\u000aBelgian health authorities are investigating their own poultry sector and blocked sales from a number of suspect farms. Kathy Brison, spokesperson for the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, said early tests suggested the levels of fipronil in Belgian eggs were much lower than those in the Netherlands. Full results, however, are still pending.\u000a\u000aGermany is far less sanguine. German officials said they are frustrated by the lack of information they received from Belgium and the Netherlands but are testing imports from both countries. Full Belgian results are still pending, but illegal levels of fipronil were detected in German and Dutch eggs.\u000a\u000aContrary to the Belgian position that there was no danger, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) said the highest level measured in Belgian eggs had a fipronil count of 1.2mg/kg. It cautioned that above 0.72mg/kg, there could be health risks for children.\u000a\u000aWilhelm Deitermann, spokesperson for North-Rhine-Westphalia\u2019s agriculture and consumer protection ministry, said Belgian authorities were \u201cnot giving us any information whatsoever\u201d on which farms had been tested or on test results. He doubted the Belgians were \u201cup to the job.\u201d\u000a\u000aLower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said it was likely that more than 10 million eggs containing fipronil were sold in Germany.\u000a\u000aWho\u2019s to blame?\u000a\u000aA senior Belgian food safety official told POLITICO that a Belgian company called Poultry Vision near Antwerp was the prime suspect. It allegedly supplied a Dutch coop-cleaning business with its own signature delousing detergent. The official said the company started using fipronil from January.\u000a\u000aAuthorities in the Netherlands also said they were investigating another Dutch company. De Volkskrant, a Dutch newspaper, named the cleaning business using the fipronil product as ChickFriend.\u000a\u000aPoultry Vision did not respond to requests for comment. However, a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity told POLITICO that he thought use of the insecticide was a simple error of judgment. \u201cI think they just did tests to see if it [the fipronil] worked and it did and then carefully tested if the animals would be harmed when spraying,\u201d the person said.\u000a\u000aChickFriend could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aDutch authorities are under fire at home for taking so long to react after they were originally tipped off about the problem on June 19. Paula de Jonge, an NVWA spokesperson, said it was in the process of finding out the background: \u201cNVWA is currently working on a timeline to place all events in chronological order. We want to establish exactly how we were informed by the Belgians.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow dangerous is fipronil?\u000a\u000aFipronil is highly toxic to bees, mice, rabbits and some birds. It acts on the central nervous system, but the effects are reversible in adults, according to BfR. NVWA says that exposure to fipronil can cause \u201cnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and epileptic seizures,\u201d but adds that, in general, these symptoms disappear. It can affect the thyroid and liver.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no evidence that the fipronil from Belgium has harmed anyone.\u000a\u000aWhat about chicken meat?\u000a\u000aThe poultry industry generally separates so-called meat birds from laying hens. These egg hens are still often slaughtered for their meat but butchering differences lower the risk of eating them.\u000a\u000aThe NVWA says that laying hens tend to be used for processed chicken meat, while fillets, for example, come from specially fattened birds. \u201cBy processing in small pieces, exposure to fipronil is likely to be very limited,\u201d the agency said.\u000a\u000aChristian Meyer, Lower Saxony\u2019s health minister, said German laboratories were testing meat. Germany\u2019s BfR had data from Belgian meat but the fipronil levels were low.\u000a\u000aWhat are retailers doing?\u000a\u000aPrivate businesses aren\u2019t waiting and pulling eggs from their shelves. German supermarket Aldi on Thursday withdrew all of its eggs, citing fipronil fears, while Lidl said it would only sell eggs they could prove were unaffected. Penny and REWE stopped selling any eggs of Dutch origin.\u000a\u000aDutch retailer Albert Heijn also removed 14 different types of eggs from its shelves.\u000a\u000aWould I be alright if I bought organic eggs?\u000a\u000aNot necessarily. The detergent illegally boosted with fipronil was originally authorized for organic farming as it was fortified only with additives such as eucalyptus and menthol. Fipronil has been found in organic eggs.\u000a\u000aCan I still eat cakes and noodles?\u000a\u000aThere are growing fears that fipronil eggs may have lingered in the food chain for months, and ended up in processed products that rely heavily on eggs. Lower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said that his state authorities would begin testing these kinds of foods. Dutch authorities are already doing so.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot rule out that poisoned eggs have also landed in cakes or pasta,\u201d Lower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said in an interview with local media.\u000a\u000aCynthia Kroet and Simon Marks contributed reporting.

aVRep. Jared Polis takes questions during a news conference about fracking as Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper stands at left inside the Capitol in Denver on Aug. 4, 2014. | Brennan Linsley/AP Photo Chance to be governor lures members from House\u000a\u000aFully half of the 18 members leaving the House next year jumped in order to run for governor in their states, looking to trade in legislative gridlock for executive orders \u2014 and the chance to play a dominating role in redrawing their colleagues\u2019 districts in four years.\u000a\u000aOne House member, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), has since dropped out of the governor\u2019s race in his state. Even so, already, more representatives are seeking governorships than the seven who ran in 2010, the last time there were as many open gubernatorial races as there will be next year. A handful of others are mulling runs of their own.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut most of the aspiring governors are vacating the comfy confines of safe congressional districts for what, historically, has been a bad bet. The last time this many sitting representatives ran for governor, in 2006, twice as many lost as won.\u000a\u000aLawmakers are motivated partly by the quest for more power \u2014 being one in a village of 435, especially in the Democratic minority, gets you only so far. They are also seeking the chance to assist or resist the Trump administration, depending on their party, in implementing new policy throughout the states.\u000a\u000aFor Democrats in particular, the choice between another term in the House minority or the chance to lead their home states can be an easy one.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a good partnership to have folks who have federal experience, have relationships here but can be the governor of their states so they don\u2019t execute some of these federal changes in a way that harms their citizens,\u201d said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), who announced in December that she would run for governor in 2018. \u201cAnd you would be in charge of redistricting.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the GOP side, members watched Republican governors make political gains and pass major policy initiatives throughout the Obama administration, and they want in on the action.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Diane Black, a four-term Republican from a safe GOP seat in Tennessee, last week became the latest lawmaker to launch a gubernatorial campaign. The current House Budget chairwoman joins eight other lawmakers, as well as a handful of others who are considering runs.\u000a\u000aThree other House Democrats are in governor\u2019s races in their states: Lujan Grisham, Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz and Colorado\u2019s Jared Polis. (Perlmutter, also of Colorado, has since dropped out of the race but won't seek reelection in the House.) Two former Democratic members, Gwen Graham of Florida and Betty Sutton of Ohio, are also running.\u000a\u000aOn the Republican side, Black and Reps. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Jim Renacci of Ohio and Raúl Labrador of Idaho are all running. Rep. Bruce Poliquin could run in Maine, especially if Sen. Susan Collins decides against a gubernatorial bid.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve made in elected office,\u201d Pearce told the Albuquerque Journal this summer. \u201cWe could have pretty well cruised in the 2nd District, but at the end of the day, if New Mexico fails while we are getting some successes in D.C. then that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost of the members running start off at least as strong contenders, if not favorites, for their party\u2019s nomination. Labrador will face Lt. Gov. Brad Little and self-funding businessman Tommy Ahlquist in solidly red Idaho, and Noem is set to battle Attorney General Marty Jackley in similarly crimson South Dakota.\u000a\u000aRenacci has tied himself to Trump ahead of a Republican primary against three statewide officials in Ohio, while Freedom Caucus member Pearce is a primary front-runner in blue-tinted New Mexico.\u000a\u000aGraham, a moderate Democrat, is the only woman in a crowded Florida Democratic field, and Grisham\u2019s path to the governorship got easier when New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas opted not to run. Walz, who represents a blue-collar district won by Trump, is one of at least six serious Democratic candidates in Minnesota, while Polis\u2019 personal wealth has him as an early favorite to at least secure the Democratic nomination in Colorado.\u000a\u000aColm O'Comartun, a former executive director of the Democratic Governors Association who is now a partner at 50 State, said House members bring positives (established fundraising networks, campaign experience) and negatives (ties to an unpopular Washington) to a gubernatorial campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can put a picture of the member with Nancy Pelosi or Barack Obama and say they represent everything wrong with Washington,\u201d he said, paraphrasing a regular GOP campaign strategy over the past eight years. But he also said the No. 1 challenge any campaign faces is gathering enough resources. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who\u2019s better equipped to raise the money than a member of Congress,\u201d O\u2019Comartun said.\u000a\u000aFor some lawmakers, the partisanship that sells well in a district back home may not translate to a statewide race where the ability to cross the aisle appeals more to voters.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the folks who end up sometimes making the best governors are folks who are pragmatic, are centrists, who just want to get things done,\u201d said Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who successfully jumped from the House to the governorship in the 1990s \u2014 though he notes he had already been elected statewide, since Delaware has one House seat.\u000a\u000aBoth Pearce and Labrador are members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. Labrador has often sparred with the only other member of the Idaho congressional delegation, moderate GOP Rep. Mike Simpson. And Pearce\u2019s hard-line politics may not play so well in a state that trends blue.\u000a\u000a\u201cSometimes the people who end up as U.S. representatives in the House are well left of center or well right of center. And those folks don\u2019t always make the best governor or the best candidate for governor,\u201d Carper added.\u000a\u000aEven in some states with one party firmly in control, the House has never been a solid steppingstone to the governorship.\u000a\u000aIn New Mexico, Colorado and South Dakota, no sitting representative has ever won the governorship, according to Eric Ostermeier, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota who tracks political trends for Smart Politics.\u000a\u000aA Democratic House member hasn\u2019t won Minnesota\u2019s governorship in more than a century. In Idaho, only one House lawmaker \u2014 outgoing Gov. Butch Otter \u2014 has ever won a gubernatorial campaign.\u000a\u000aThe aspiring governors in Ohio and Tennessee have slightly better historical records to fall back on. Both states have seen three sitting lawmakers elected governor since the turn of the 20th century. But the most recent in Ohio was Democrat Ted Strickland in 2006, and in Tennessee, and it\u2019s been nearly a quarter-century since Republican Don Sundquist won, Ostermeier said.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVLONDON \u2014 When do peaceful \u2014 if extremist \u2014 opinions become an incitement to violence? That\u2019s the question British security services are struggling with after a spate of deadly attacks, in which previously nonviolent groups inspired radicalized youth to commit acts of terror.\u000a\u000aAt the center of the debate is al-Muhajiroun, a fundamentalist Islamist network that was formally shut down by the government in 2004 but has continued to live in a series of successor organizations.\u000a\u000aThe perpetrators of at least half of all domestic terrorist attacks in recent years \u2014 including the 2005 London tube bombings and the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in 2012 \u2014 had links to the al-Muhajiroun network, according to a study by Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. And around a third of all European Muslims who went to Syria to fight on behalf of the Islamic State had ties to the group.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an organization that has been sending people abroad to fight for decades, whether it\u2019s going to Chechnya, Syria, Iraq, even Africa,\u201d said Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at the anti-extremism watchdog Hope Not Hate and author of a major report on al-Muhajiroun. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a terror attack in the U.K., one of the first things we do is see if there\u2019s links to al-Muhajiroun because it\u2019s become so regular.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd yet, for the most part, the organization has been allowed to operate in plain sight. Its activities have been so public that a January 2016 Channel 4 documentary showed members of the group unfolding a black Islamic State flag in London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Park.\u000a\u000aA few weeks before the show aired, one of its main characters, Abu Ramaysah, appeared in a video of a beheading carried out by the Islamic State in Syria. Over a year later, another man who appeared in the documentary, Khuram Butt, went on a murderous rampage on London Bridge, killing seven people.\u000a\u000aThe group has made a point of calling attention to itself, with extremist publicity stunts, such as a \u201cmarch against alcohol\u201d in London\u2019s East End, and demonstrations protesting the repatriation of soldiers killed overseas. In 2010, Islamists affiliated with the group set fire to poppies outside London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall and chanted \u201cBritish soldiers burn in hell.\u201d\u000a\u000aAl-Muhajiroun \u201cpreaches a very aggressive exclusionist rhetoric,\u201d said Pantucci, who is also the author of \u201cWe Love Death As You Love Life: Britain\u2019s Suburban Terrorists.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re nonviolent in what they say but the reality is they are very much pushing and agitating a violent direction.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor years, one of al-Muhajiroun\u2019s founders, Anjem Choudary, was a regular fixture on British news shows, as an extremist rent-a-quote who could always be relied on to say something incendiary. \u201cFor a long time, they were laughable,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cThey did these outrageous stunts that were so extreme they were almost funny. The press found them amusing but didn\u2019t take them seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe stunts \u2014 and the heavy press coverage \u2014 helped the network appeal to new young recruits.\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw Choudary on TV talking about how Muslims are mistreated and \u2026 it appealed to me at the time,\u201d said Hasan (not his real name), a London-based youth worker who was briefly drawn to the group in 2008. \u201cI was angry, I was lost, I was seeing atrocities overseas, I didn\u2019t have anywhere to put that anger.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a sense of community that I didn\u2019t feel I had before because I was lonely and doing badly at my studies,\u201d he added. Hasan did not stay long in the group, as he began feeling alienated by some of its darker rhetoric.\u000a\u000a\u201cPublicly, it was all anti-violence, but as I spent more time [with the group], I just had this feeling that something isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m glad I got out when I did or I dread to think where I could be now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group\u2019s vocal appearances in the media have been a source of deep frustration for British Muslims, who have long feared that the small extremist network is conveying a false narrative of the community as a whole.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur sensationalist and irresponsible media has, in fact, been deeply complicit in the rise of this fanatic [Choudary], devoting quite disproportionate and counterproductive coverage to his various rantings,\u201d wrote prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan in 2010. A Facebook group named \u201cMuslims Against Anjem Choudary\u201d has nearly 4,000 members.\u000a\u000aFor much of the past decade, al-Muhajiroun has managed to remain just on the right side of various laws prohibiting incitement to violence. And when the authorities would shut down one organization, its members would simply found another, nearly identical group.\u000a\u000aFor example, Islam4UK \u2014 a major recruitment network for the Islamic State \u2014 was banned in 2010, but was replaced the following year by Muslims Against Crusades, which in turn was also banned. Muslims Against Crusades is \u201csimply another name for an organization already proscribed under a number of names,\u201d said then Home Secretary Theresa May, who made the decision to impose the ban in November 2011.\u000a\u000aMore recently, however, as the group\u2019s ties to foreign fighters have become impossible to ignore, the government has started to crack down. In September 2016, Choudary and a co-defendant, Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, were found guilty of providing support to a terrorist organization, the Islamic State. Both men were sentenced to five years and six months in prison.\u000a\u000aThe convictions have left the group weakened, but still potentially dangerous.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that people that are left are still organizing but they don\u2019t seem to have the structures they once did,\u201d said Mulhall.\u000a\u000aThe government crackdown has taken its toll, as has the fact that hundreds of its followers have left for Syria. \u201cBut the legacy of that group still exists, the way they radicalized and indoctrinated people,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we saw [with the attack on London Bridge], it\u2019s a continuing threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aSamira Shackle is a freelance journalist based in London.

He is still in touch with May but does not advise her on policy, he said.\u000a\u000aAccording to Timothy, the prime minister remains intent on negotiating a Brexit deal that includes the \u201cfundamental things that the country voted for,\u201d including leaving the EU, taking control of immigration policy, freeing the country of the European Court of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction and ending membership fees. \u201cI\u2019m confident those things will end,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aTimothy also dismissed talk of the U.K. becoming a partial member of the European Economic Area.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intention of the government has been clear from the beginning \u2014 that if you seek a partial relationship the danger is that you will be in the worst of all worlds, where you will be a rule-taker with none of the advantages of being in, but you will also sacrifice some of the advantages of being out,\u201d Timothy said.\u000a\u000aMay\u2019s Cabinet will stick to the strategy she set out in January, to have a transition period before the U.K. leaves the EU and its structures, he added.\u000a\u000aHowever, former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King warned on Saturday that the U.K. needs a \u201cbackup\u201d plan in case it fails to reach a trade deal with the EU.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to be able to say if we can\u2019t reach an agreement we will nevertheless leave and we can make it work,\u201d King, now a member of the House of Lords, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Program.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a doable proposition if we start now. We\u2019ve probably wasted a year, but we need to be much further along the road to make it a credible fallback position.\u201d

aVAfter the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, the CIA appeared eager, even desperate, to embrace the version of events being offered by the FBI, the Secret Service and other parts of the government. The official story: that a delusional misfit and self-proclaimed Marxist named Lee Harvey Oswald killed the president in Dallas with his $21 mail-order rifle and there was no evidence of a conspiracy, foreign or domestic. Certainly, the CIA\u2019s leaders told the Warren Commission, the independent panel that investigated the murder, there was no evidence of a conspiracy that the spy agency could have foiled.\u000a\u000aBut thousands of pages of long-secret, assassination-related documentsreleased by the National Archives last week show that, within a few years of Kennedy\u2019s murder, some in the CIA began to worry internally that the official story was wrong\u2014an alarm the agency never sounded publicly.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, key CIA officials were concerned by the mid-1970s that the agency, the FBI, the Secret Service and the White House commission led by Chief Justice Earl Warren had never followed up on important clues about Oswald\u2019s contact with foreign agents, including diplomats and spies for the Communist governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union, who might have been aware of his plans to kill Kennedy and even encouraged the plot. (There is no credible evidence cited in the documents released so far that Cuban leader Fidel Castro or other foreign leaders had any personal role in ordering Kennedy\u2019s murder.)\u000a\u000aThe CIA documents also offer tantalizing speculation about the chain of events in late 1963 that explained Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy, which have previously never been established with certainty\u2014how he may have become enraged after reading a detailed article in his hometown newspaper in New Orleans in September suggesting that his hero Castro had been targeted for assassination by the Kennedy administration. According to that theory, Oswald, who had rifle training in the Marine Corps, then set out to seek vengeance on Castro\u2019s behalf\u2014to kill Kennedy before the American president managed to kill the Cuban leader.\u000a\u000aThat 27-page memo, which does not identify its author, is among the most intriguing of the documents in last week\u2019s batch unsealed by the National Archives.\u000a\u000aIf that proved true, it would have raised a terrible question for the CIA: Was it possible that JFK\u2019s assassination was, directly or indirectly, blowback for the spy agency\u2019s plots to kill Castro? It would eventually be acknowledged the CIA had, in fact, repeatedly tried to assassinate Castro, sometimes in collusion with the Mafia, throughout Kennedy\u2019s presidency. The CIA\u2019s arsenal of weapons against Castro included a fungus-infected scuba suit, a poison-filled hypodermic needle hidden in a pen\u2014and even an exploding cigar. The Warren Commission, never told about the CIA\u2019s Castro plots, mostly ducked the question of Oswald\u2019s motives, other than saying in its final report that he had expressed a \u201chatred for American society.\u201d\u000a\u000aJFK historians and the nation\u2019s large army of private assassination researchers are still scrambling to make sense of the latest batch of tens of thousands of pages of previously secret CIA and FBI documents that were unsealed last week by the National Archives. The documents\u2014441 files that had previously been withheld entirely, along with 3,369 other documents that had been previously released only in part\u2014were made public under terms of a 1992 law that requires the unsealing of all JFK assassination-related documents by October, the law\u2019s 25-year deadline.\u000a\u000aSince the release last week, researchers do not appear to have identified any single document that could be labeled a bombshell or that rewrites the history of the assassination in any significant way. Many of the documents, which were made public only online, are duplicates of files that had been released years earlier. Other documents are totally illegible or refer to CIA and FBI code names and pseudonyms that even experienced researchers will take months to decipher. Several documents are written in foreign languages.\u000a\u000aStill, the newly released documents may offer an intriguing glimpse of what comes next. The National Archives is required to unseal a final batch of about 3,100 never-before-seen JFK-assassination files by the October deadline, assuming the move is not blocked by President Donald Trump. Under the 1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, the president is the only person empowered to stop the release. (Congressional and other government officials have told us in confidence that at least two federal agencies\u2014likely the CIA and FBI\u2014are expected to appeal to Trump to block the unsealing of at least some of the documents. Even after 54 years, some government officials apparently still want to keep secrets about this seminal event in U.S. history. The CIA and FBI acknowledged earlier this year they are conducting a final review of the documents, but have been unwilling to say if they will ask the president to block some from being released.)\u000a\u000aNone of the files released last week undermines the Warren Commission\u2019s finding that Oswald killed Kennedy with shots fired from his perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza\u2014a conclusion supported by 21st century forensic analysis\u2014and that there was no credible evidence of a second gunman.\u000a\u000aBut the new documents do revive the question of why the CIA, so skeptical internally of many of the commission\u2019s other findings by the 1970s, never acknowledged those suspicions to later government investigators\u2014or to the public. Documents released decades ago show that CIA and FBI officials repeatedly misled\u2014and often lied outright\u2014to Chief Justice Warren and his commission, probably to hide evidence of the agencies\u2019 bungling in their surveillance of Oswald before the president\u2019s murder. The CIA appears also to have been determined to block the commission from stumbling on to evidence that might reveal the agency\u2019s assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the CIA\u2019s in-house historian concluded that the spy agency had conducted a \u201cbenign cover-up\u201d during the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation in 1963 and 1964 in hopes of keeping the commission focused on \u201cwhat the Agency believed was the \u2018best truth\u2019 \u2014 that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut what if the \u201cbest truth\u201d was wrong? According to documents made public last week, the CIA was alarmed by the mid-1970s to realize that no one had properly followed up on clues about an especially mysterious chapter in Oswald\u2019s life\u2014a six-day, apparently self-financed trip to Mexico City beginning in late September 1963, two months before the assassination. The reason for the trip has never been determined with certainty, although he told his wife, Marina, that he went there to obtain a visa that would allow him to defect to Cuba, much as he had once attempted to defect to the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aThe CIA acknowledged long ago that the agency\u2019s Mexico City station had Oswald under surveillance during the trip, and that he met there with Cuban and Soviet diplomats and spies. The CIA station chief said later he was convinced that Oswald had a brief sexual relationship with a Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate. Although there is no credible evidence of Soviet involvement in the assassination, Oswald\u2019s other contacts in Mexico included\u2014shockingly enough\u2014a KGB assassinations expert who doubled as an accredited Soviet diplomat. A top-secret June 1964 FBI report, made public in the 1990s but apparently never seen by key investigators for the Warren Commission, suggests that Oswald was overheard threatening to kill Kennedy during his visits to the Cuban diplomatic compound in Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe files released last week also show that the CIA and other agencies failed to pursue clues that Oswald, who publicly championed Castro\u2019s revolution even while serving in the Marine Corps, had been in contact with Cuban diplomats years before the Mexico trip\u2014possibly as early as 1959, when he was deployed to a military base in Southern California. The information initially came to the FBI and the Warren Commission from a fellow Marine who recalled how Oswald boasted about his contacts with Cuban diplomats in Los Angeles, where Castro\u2019s government then had an office.\u000a\u000aThe account from the fellow Marine was of \u201ca lot more possible operational significance\u201d than was realized in the months after the assassination but was never \u201crun down or developed by investigation,\u201d according to a 1975 CIA internal memo released last week. \u201cThe record of the beginning of OSWALD\u2019s relationship with the Cubans starts with a question mark.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat 27-page memo, which does not identify its author, is among the most intriguing of the documents in last week\u2019s batch unsealed by the National Archives. Copies of the document were found inside larger CIA files released last week, including thick agency files labeled HELMS HEARING DUPLICATE. That seems to suggest the memo was given to former Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms, who led the agency from 1966 to 1973, when he was later summoned to testify secretly to Congress about his involvement in the CIA assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders. Similar documents about the Kennedy assassination and Oswald were written in the 1970s by a senior CIA counterintelligence official, Raymond Rocca, who had served as the agency\u2019s chief liaison to the Warren Commission.\u000a\u000aLabeled \u201cSECRET\u201d and stamped \u201cREPRODUCTION PROHIBITED\u201d on each page, the 1975 memo lists several important clues about Oswald that went unexplored in the months and years after Kennedy\u2019s death. (Versions of the same CIA memo were part of the flood of millions of pages of documents released after the 1992 law, although it has never attracted detailed attention outside a small circle of assassination researchers. Brian Latell, a respected former CIA analyst on Cuban intelligence, cited a version of the document in his 2012 book Castro\u2019s Secrets, which suggested much closer links between Oswald and Cuba than had previously been known.)\u000a\u000aThe 1975 document noted the failure of the CIA, FBI and the Warren Commission to interview a key witness in Mexico City\u2014Silvia Duran, the Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate and was reported to have had the affair with Oswald. She is the \u201csole live witness on the record regarding Oswald\u2019s activities,\u201d yet her testimony \u201cwas taken and presented, solely, by the Mexican governmental authorities,\u201d the CIA memo said. Duran, who is still alive, has repeatedly insisted she had no sexual relationship with Oswald, although she readily acknowledges that she helped him with his unsuccessful visa application for Cuba.\u000a\u000aIt was that same CIA memo that offered a detailed theory of the chain of events that led Oswald to kill Kennedy\u2014how Oswald, who lived in his hometown of New Orleans for much of 1963, may have been inspired to assassinate the president if, as seemed probable, he read an article on Monday, September 9, in the local newspaper, that suggested Castro was targeted for murder by the United States.\u000a\u000aThe article, written by a reporter for The Associated Press in Havana and then published prominently in the Times-Picayune, was an account of an AP interview with Castro two days earlier, in which the Cuban strongman angrily warned the Kennedy administration that he was aware of U.S. assassination plots aimed at Cuban leaders, presumably including him, and was prepared to retaliate. The article quoted Castro as saying: \u201cU.S. leaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to do away with leaders of Cuba.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe CIA memo suggested that if Oswald, who was known to be an \u201cavid reader\u201d of the Times-Picayune, saw the article, it might have put the idea in his head to kill Kennedy as retaliation for the threat the United States posed to Castro\u2014an idea that would have been in his mind as he left for his trip to Mexico that month. The possibility that Oswald read the article \u201cmust be considered of great significance in light of the pathological evolution of Oswald\u2019s passive/aggressive makeup\u201d and \u201chis identification with Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution,\u201d the CIA memo said.\u000a\u000aImmediately after the assassination, the CIA\u2019s Mexico City station warned CIA headquarters that the AP article might contain a vital clue about Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy\u2014and even about possible Cuban involvement. But according to the 1975 analysis, \u201cThere is no evidence in the files on the Kennedy assassination that the Castro interview was considered in following up leads or in dealing with the Warren Commission, although Mexico Station specifically directed headquarters to the AP story very shortly after the Dallas killing.\u201d\u000a\u000aPreviously released internal documents from the Warren Commission show that one of the commission\u2019s most aggressive staff lawyers believed that Castro\u2019s remarks to the AP\u2014and the possibility that Oswald read the article\u2014might be of great significance in explaining Oswald\u2019s motives. But the internal files show that more senior staff members decided against any reference to the AP article in the commission\u2019s final report for fear of feeding conspiracy theories about a possible Cuban link to Kennedy\u2019s death. It does not reflect well on the legacy of either the CIA or the commission that, half a century after those gunshots rang out in Dealey Plaza, the newly released documents suggest that at least some of those conspiracy theories might be true.\u000a\u000aPhilip Shenon, a former Washington and foreign correspondent for the New York Times, is the author of A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination.\u000a\u000aLarry J.

aVKellyanne Conway\u2019s office has a different vibe than other corners of the West Wing.\u000a\u000aUnlike some of the drab work spaces belonging to her male counterparts, whose offices look as impersonal as the day they moved in, Conway\u2019s office is decorated with colorfully framed, oversize family photos mounted on the walls and a copy of Ivanka Trump\u2019s book \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d prominently on display.\u000a\u000aThe comfy digs are a sign that Conway, the White House counselor who recently has been keeping a lower profile, is planning on being here for the long haul \u2014 even though some of her colleagues, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and recently departed chief of staff Reince Priebus, have at times tried to cut her out of the information loop.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, former colleagues like Priebus, Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer, Michael Flynn, Michael Dubke, Michael Short and Boris Epshteyn have been fired, or simply resigned to save themselves. Even Bannon, according to multiple people close to President Donald Trump, has been the target of the president\u2019s recent frustrations and anger, and he has been trying to lower his genius-behind-the-throne profile in order to avoid sharing Priebus\u2019 unhappy fate.\u000a\u000aConway, however, is not alone in surviving the snakepit. The quiet endurers of Trump\u2019s tumultuous White House, by and large, are the women who serve in his administration. That fact that may seem ironic in an administration run by a man who has launched sexist attacks on everyone from morning show host Mika Brzezinski to his former campaign opponent Hillary Clinton \u2014 and who in the past has been accused by more than a dozen women of groping or kissing them against their will.\u000a\u000aBut the women of the West Wing, at least so far, have had the more stable ride. Former Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell has risen in the ranks to become deputy national security adviser. She was also on the final shortlist of people Trump was considering for the chief of staff job given to retired General John Kelly, according to two White House officials.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s no different to women than he is to men\u201d \u2014 Barbara Res, a former top construction executive at the Trump Organization\u000a\u000aIt was Powell, alongside U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who was invited to ride in Trump\u2019s car, known as \u201cThe Beast,\u201d from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base last Friday, hours before the president unceremoniously fired Priebus in the rain.\u000a\u000aCommunications adviser Hope Hicks maintains an unassailable position as a surrogate family member and loyal aide by the president\u2019s side, where she has stood since before there was even a campaign.\u000a\u000aSarah Huckabee Sanders has risen to the position of press secretary, after Spicer resigned because he was not given the full control of the communications department that he demanded.\u000a\u000aDuring Scaramucci\u2019s brief attempt at cleansing the West Wing of former Republican National Committee staffers, he managed to oust press aide Short, but not another RNC alum, Lindsay Walters, who was also brought on board by Priebus.\u000a\u000aTrump adviser Omarosa Manigault, famous for playing a villain on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d has so far been leading a surprisingly drama-free, if not particularly visible, work life in the White House.\u000a\u000aAnd Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and a senior adviser, has skated past the FBI\u2019s ongoing Russia investigation, which has entangled both her husband and her older brother, Donald Trump Jr.\u000a\u000aSo far, only two women have been moved out of Trump\u2019s West Wing. Former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator, was seen as collateral damage in Flynn\u2019s firing and was given a cushy landing as ambassador to Singapore. Katie Walsh, Priebus\u2019 former deputy, who had no real personal relationship with the president, never overcame her internal reputation as a Priebus henchwoman.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear exactly why women have had more stable runs, at least so far, in Trump\u2019s West Wing, a place that has proposed policies deeply threatening to traditional women\u2019s interests, such as the defunding of Planned Parenthood and the rolling back of Obama-era regulations on equal pay.\u000a\u000aInterviews with former staffers, current White House officials and political observers give most of the credit to women being better equipped to navigate Trump\u2019s short-fused personality, as well as his inability to cope with anyone getting more attention than him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s no different to women than he is to men,\u201d said Barbara Res, a former top construction executive at the Trump Organization who worked directly under Trump and said he hasn\u2019t changed his playbook in 30 years. \u201cHe\u2019s not any more solicitous of women. He likes to have everyone on edge, people competing with each other, he likes to divide and conquer, he likes everyone to think they work directly for him, men and women alike.\u201d\u000a\u000aRes said she doesn\u2019t think Trump views his direct reports in terms of gender. \u201cHe never thought of me as a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought I was a real estate animal, he loved my killer instincts. That\u2019s what he wanted. The ones he saw as women were the secretaries.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat sentiment was echoed by McFarland in an interview earlier this year with Business Insider. \u201cI don\u2019t think he cares two hoots whether I was male or female,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just thought I could get the job done.\u201d\u000a\u000aA White House official said: \u201cThe president has employed women at the highest levels of his company, his campaign and now his administration, and their successes are a testament in part to his leadership, but as he would be the first to tell you, more importantly their capabilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Res said women may have an easier time navigating the competitive work atmosphere that Trump likes to foster because they are naturally more self-protective. \u201cIt would be rare to find a female Scaramucci,\u201d she said, noting it was unlikely that a woman would unload the profane tirade against White House officials that ultimately cost Scaramucci his job.\u000a\u000aA White House official said: \u201cThe President has employed women at the highest levels of his company, his campaign and now his administration and their successes are a testament in part to his leadership, but as he would be the first to tell you, more importantly their capabilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdded Alexandra De Luca, press secretary to EMILY\u2019s List: \u201cWomen who are successful in their careers have usually had to deal with misogynistic jerks along the way. This White House is about as toxic as it gets \u2014 but women have learned how to manage, and ignore, Trump\u2019s particular brand of egomania in a way that their male counterparts just haven\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThose women are being work horses, not show horses\u201d \u2014 Alyssa Mastromonaco, a former top official in Obama\u2019s White House\u000a\u000aIndeed, some of the women who have succeeded in Trump\u2019s circle are those who gamely play along with the role the president casts them in. On the evening after his inauguration, Trump gave a shout-out to his former campaign manager at a black-tie dinner. \u201cI see my Kellyanne,\u201d Trump said from the stage, beckoning her to join him and then kissing her hand and calling her \u201cbaby.\u201d She smiled and curtsied.\u000a\u000aDuring a joint appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d in 2006, Ivanka Trump smiled along while her dad remarked on her figure and noted while seated next to her on the couch: \u201cIf Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther White House observers had a different theory of why the women are surviving: None of them have occupied the hot seat jobs. With a few exceptions, the women in Trump\u2019s White House have simply not been given enough authority to be targeted for professional assassination.\u000a\u000aOf the 22 staffers who take home the maximum salary of $179,700, just five are women \u2014 Conway, Hicks, Manigault, Powell and Lindsay Reynolds, chief of staff to the first lady. That\u2019s not a phenomenon unique to Trump\u2019s White House: Women in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, during his first term, struggled to have a seat at the table and a voice in policy discussions, and two-thirds of the president\u2019s top aides were men.\u000a\u000aThe lack of top female advisers became an optics problem for Trump in the opening days of his administration, when he would often be surrounded by a gaggle of white men crowding around the Resolute Desk for a photo-op signing of an executive order.\u000a\u000aWhile she has been cut out of many meetings, Conway, people close to her said, sees the upside of the floater role she currently occupies. It allows her to fly under the radar when necessary and stay out of the president\u2019s ever-changing line of fire. White House officials said it remains to be seen how long Sanders will remain in the president\u2019s favor now that she is in the media spotlight on a daily basis.\u000a\u000aBut most White House officials and former campaign staffers interviewed credit the tactics of the female White House officials for knowing how best to manage Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn this White House, most of the drama queens are men,\u201d said Stu Loeser, a former press secretary to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. For example, Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, waged a war against each other for weeks, until Trump told them to work it out. The tension between Bannon and Priebus, in the early days of the administration, became so unmanageable that they took their fake buddy comedy on the road, making a knee-slapping appearance together at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in an attempt to change the narrative.\u000a\u000aOne factor that several White House officials pointed to: the number of senior White House women who have three to six children. One official said that between kids and a demanding day job, \u201cthey just don\u2019t have the same amount of time to stir the pot.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother White House aide added that the female staffers who have succeeded in the administration are the ones who \u201ckeep their heads down\u201d and don\u2019t try to be in the press or push their own agenda. Trump also notices which people generally command the respect of everyone else in the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose women are being work horses, not show horses,\u201d said Alyssa Mastromonaco, a former top official in Obama\u2019s White House, who has experienced the pressure-cooker environment of being one of the few top women in the West Wing. \u201cThey all seem to be genuinely focused on the presidency and not building a personal brand. I may not share Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 politics, but she\u2019s working her ass off and deserves more credit than she gets.\u201d

aVThe National Flood Insurance Program, which offers over $3 trillion in coverage to about 5 million policyholders, is scheduled to expire in September. The program is widely understood to be beset by significant design flaws but has evaded reforms throughout its fifty years of existence. Will anything be different during this year\u2019s reauthorization debate? As of now, the House Financial Services Committee led by Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has put forth reform legislation, but key coastal senators including Marco Rubio Marco RubioSantorum: How to get family policy right for working families Overnight Finance: Trump-Russia probe reportedly expands to possible financial crimes | Cruel September looms for GOP | Senate clears financial nominees | Mulvaney reverses on debt ceiling Florida Dems hosting fundraiser for GOP lawmaker MORE (R-Fla.) and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenFive tough decisions for the GOP on healthcare Warren: 'I am not running for president, I\u2019m doing my work' Senators push federal prisons to expand compassionate release MORE (D-Mass.) seem resistant to meaningful change.\u000a\u000aThere may be a less controversial legislative solution that allows private insurers to make the most of recent advances in catastrophic modeling and financial risk sharing technology. Bolstering the private insurance market should not elicit the same pushback as past attempts to change the program itself.\u000a\u000aADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the NFIP into law in 1968. At the time, policymakers believed that government insurance could do a better job than the private sector of encouraging the right mix of economic development and mitigation in flood prone areas.\u000a\u000aThe track record of the NFIP to date demonstrates that this belief was misguided. The program\u2019s largest problems stem from its irrational and inaccurate pricing method that stokes moral hazard and has led to its accrual of $24 billion in debt. Premiums do not reflect assessments of risk at the property level but are instead based on average historical losses within a property\u2019s risk zone. Risks can vary greatly within a given zone so these averages are of limited use, and the floodplain maps determining the zones are often decades out of date. All in all, premiums are only tangentially related to the risk of flooding.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the inaccuracy, premiums do not include a loading charge to build reserves for especially bad years. About one in five policies receive a 60-65 percent discount off the full risk premium price. These explicit subsidies have nothing to do with financial need, but instead relate to the age of a property.\u000a\u000aCongress could theoretically could fix some of these flaws, but past efforts at reform have been stymied by the homeowners who benefit from the program\u2019s current design. In fact, Congress passed reforms in 2012 that would have introduced loading charges and ended subsidies, only to repeal or pause these measures in 2014 after an intense lobbying effort.\u000a\u000aSo long as some homeowners receive a significant financial benefit from the program, it will be difficult to reform it so that it operates in a sustainable way. This dynamic is compounded by the fact that the NFIP\u2019s beneficiaries are disproportionately wealthy and thereby are more likely to have politicians\u2019 ears. A Congressional Budget Office study found that a NFIP insured home\u2019s median value is double that of a typical American home and that 25 percent of explicitly subsidized properties near coasts are vacation homes.\u000a\u000aThe best steps Congress can take this time around are measures that encourage the growth of a private insurance market. Advances in catastrophic modeling and insurance-linked securities mean that private insurers are interested in flood and can price the risk accurately. Wharton School researchers found that the NFIP\u2019s inaccurate pricing method means that the program overcharges many policyholders, who therefore would save money with private insurance.\u000a\u000aPrivate insurance would better meet the ideal of a sensible balance between development and risk mitigation that motivated the creation of the NFIP in 1968. That\u2019s because market based insurance rates force households and businesses to internalize the true risk of owning property in a flood-prone area. Private insurers reward steps taken to limit risk with lower premiums. The NFIP\u2019s premiums distort these price signals and on the whole lead to overdevelopment in floodplains.\u000a\u000aFull privatization is unlikely to be politically feasible as of now, but policymakers should attempt reforms that allow private insurers to compete with the NFIP on a level playing field. Measures that mandate FEMA to release property level flood insurance data and make it easier for private plans to meet mandatory purchase requirements have passed the House Financial Services Committee. The full House of Representatives is set to vote on these bills by late August.\u000a\u000aOne of the reasons it has been so difficult to reform the NFIP\u2019s premium structure in the past is the influence of Southeast Atlantic Coast senators, who oppose measures that would force their constituents to pay more. Allowing for a private market to operate in tandem with the NFIP might be a more palatable reform option for these lawmakers.\u000a\u000aThe National Flood Insurance Program has avoided significant reform to date despite its perverse effects because of an entrenched group of politically connected beneficiaries. By allowing a private market to flourish, Congress will have laid the groundwork for a more sustainable and fair flood insurance system.\u000a\u000aIke Brannon is a visiting fellow at the Cato Institute and Ari Blask is a research assistant at Cato\u2019s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives.\u000a\u000aThe views expressed by this author are their own and are not the views of The Hill.

aVPosted 07 Aug\u000a\u000aFunction:\u000a\u000aNATO\u2019s Public Diplomacy efforts serve a vital function within the Alliance by communicating its purpose and priorities to audiences worldwide. In fulfilling this role, the Public Diplomacy Division (PDD) actively strengthens NATO\u2019s public image, thereby fostering awareness and understanding of NATO\u2019s policies and activities, and ultimately enhance trust in and support for the Alliance.\u000a\u000aPDD works to promote security cooperation through a variety of programmes in NATO and partner countries and contributes to a continuous process of international security debate and policy creation. The Division also acts as coordinator for strategic communication activities across all NATO civilian and military bodies and harmonises public diplomacy activities undertaken by other Divisions at NATO Headquarters (HQ), as well as by other entities belonging to the NATO structure.\u000a\u000aThe NATO Information Office (NIO) in Moscow assists PDD in its interface with the Russian civil society and in reaching out more widely to Russian audiences through a yearly conference programme, a programme of visits to and from headquarters, a programme of media activities, and the distribution of NATO information material to the Russian public. The NIO is a NATO-asset outside the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) framework. It is also mandated to regularly liaise with the NATO Contact Point Embassy (CPE) (no NATO CPE has been appointed for the current term), with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other Russian civilian and military authorities as appropriate.\u000a\u000aThe Director of the NIO is responsible for promoting understanding of and support for NATO policies and programmes in Russia. He/she, together with local staff and, as appropriate, the support of the Contact Point Embassy, implements North Atlantic Council (NAC) policy and priorities, plans events and evaluates the effectiveness of NATO activities in Russia or with Russian audiences.\u000a\u000aProfile:\u000a\u000aThe ideal candidate will possess a degree from a university (Master\u2019s level or above) or from an institute of recognised standing in a relevant discipline (political or social sciences; international relations; journalism / public relations / public diplomacy; law; etc.) with at least ten year of relevant professional experience. He/She will be fluent in Russian and available to live in Moscow with extensive travel in Russia.\u000a\u000aA strong background in public information work including public and media appearances with several years\u2019 experience in working with and briefing high level groups, would be considered an advantage\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson | Mohd Rasfan/AFP via Getty Images Tillerson: US will respond to Russia\u2019s move to expel diplomats by September 1 Moscow responded to congressional sanctions by turfing out 755 American embassy and consulate staff.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government will respond by the end of this month to the Russian government\u2019s decision to reduce the number of American diplomatic staff in Russia by more than 700, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday morning, according to an Associated Press report.\u000a\u000aTillerson\u2019s promise of a U.S. response followed his Sunday meeting in the Philippines with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, where the secretary of state said he asked his Russian counterpart \u201cseveral clarifying questions.\u201d The U.S. has yet to decide on what retaliatory steps it would take, Tillerson said, only that those steps would be taken by September 1.\u000a\u000aRussia\u2019s move to order a 755-person reduction of U.S. embassy and consulate staff was itself a retaliatory step, retribution for sanctions legislation passed last month by Congress that targets the Russian government, along with the governments of Iran and North Korea. President Donald Trump, accused by critics of being too cozy with Russia, signed the bill last week despite what he described in a signing statement as the bill\u2019s Constitutional flaws.\u000a\u000aTillerson also told reporters that the Russian delegation had shown \u201csome willingness\u201d during their Sunday meeting to begin discussions on ending the ongoing violence in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia\u2019s military has been active since a 2014 revolution that removed pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych.\u000a\u000aThe secretary of state said the U.S. has been purposefully deliberate in its negotiations regarding Ukraine, ensuring that no party feels cut out of the process.\u000a\u000aDeep differences between the U.S. and Russia remain, Tillerson said, although he added that the two nations still have important security issues to discuss. Russia and the U.S. should not \u201cjust cut everything off on one single issue\u201d like Ukraine, Tillerson said.

aVDozens of reporters and a horde of photographers turned out for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 news conference Friday to announce a crackdown on leaks, but the most important target for his message wasn't in the room: President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019 eight-minute broadside against leaks and his stern warning to leakers seemed to be aimed at trying to repair his badly frayed relationship with Trump, who has expressed regret for selecting Sessions and who has specifically complained that he was doing too little to fight the tidal wave of leaks that have swamped the Trump White House.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst, let me say that I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect our country,\u201d Sessions declared. \u201cWe are taking a stand. This culture of leaking must stop. \u2026 Cases will be made, and leakers will be held accountable.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf Sessions\u2019 desire to address the leaks of most concern to Trump wasn\u2019t sufficiently apparent, the attorney general offered unsolicited outrage toward the leak that roiled the West Wing this week: the publication of transcripts of Trump\u2019s confidential conversations with Mexico\u2019s president and Australia\u2019s prime minister earlier this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust yesterday, we saw media reports about conversations the president had with foreign leaders,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cNo one is entitled to surreptitiously fight to advance battles in the media by revealing sensitive government information.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aEven Sessions\u2019 thinly veiled threat toward the press seemed intended to curry favor with the occupant of the Oval Office, who regularly castigates the news media on Twitter over \u201cFAKE NEWS.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe respect the important role that the press plays and we will give them respect, but it is not unlimited,\u201d the attorney general warned. \u201cThey cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance the press\u2019 role with protecting national security and the lives of those who serve in the intelligence community and all law-abiding Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000aSessions also got in two digs at another part of the Washington establishment that Trump seems to be sour on at the moment: Congress. The attorney general suggested, without providing specifics, that lawmakers or their aides are responsible for some of the recent leaks.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019 long-distance missive to the president comes as their relationship seems to be settling into a chilly detente.\u000a\u000aInterventions from Sessions\u2019 Senate friends, his allies in the White House and conservative leaders appear to have stemmed the near-daily taunts that Trump directed toward his attorney general last month.\u000a\u000aTrump has now gone more than a week without publicly attacking Sessions. Trump\u2019s new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, also called Sessions last weekend with reassurances that his job was safe. (Sessions and Trump were face to face at a Cabinet meeting Monday, but there are no signs the men have sorted out their issues.)\u000a\u000aTrump has calmed down on Sessions, several senior administration officials said, after having conversations with a number of people who arranged to see him and defend the attorney general. The president was also distracted by the other problems in his administration and has talked less about Sessions, one aide said.\u000a\u000aKelly has also told the president that it would be a mistake to cut ties with Sessions, and Trump has told others privately he has no plans to make a change, said one person who spoke with the president last weekend.\u000a\u000aThe public silence from Trump has Sessions\u2019 aides and allies breathing a sigh of relief but it is an uneasy peace, marked by concern that the president's ire could surface again at any moment. While Trump is no longer publicly mocking his attorney general, the president has offered no public praise for Sessions nor even any acknowledgment of his work to advance the administration's priorities.\u000a\u000aBut Trump\u2019s anger could be triggered at any point by the ongoing Russia probe, these people said, because he still blames Sessions for those headaches.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they\u2019re going to look into business deals and start looking into his family and this or that, he\u2019s going to blame Sessions,\u201d one adviser said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to associate his problems with Sessions.\u201d\u000a\u000aFriday\u2019s event at Justice Department headquarters was carefully structured to ensure that Sessions\u2019 message reached Trump with the fewest distractions possible. If reporters had the chance to question the attorney general about the Russia investigation, he might have demurred because he has recused from the probe. But with the recusal at the core of Trump's complaints about Sessions, any televised scene of the attorney general broaching the subject could send the president into a blue rage.\u000a\u000aSo, Sessions filed out after he spoke. Cameras were then shut off at Justice officials\u2019 insistence before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein returned to take reporters' questions about the nitty-gritty of the leak crackdown.\u000a\u000aOne question the deputy attorney general got: whether Friday\u2019s press event was arranged at the instigation of the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe answer to that is, everybody in the intelligence community recognizes that we\u2019ve been dealing with an increased number of leaks,\u201d Rosenstein said, not answering directly. \u201cSo, I think we\u2019ve heard that from many senior government representatives. We've also heard it from congressmen and senators.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked whether the Justice Department was out to \u201cappease\u201d the president, Rosenstein replied: \u201cI'm not going to comment on that other than to say \u2026 I think it is appropriate for everyone to be concerned.\u201d\u000a\u000aFriday\u2019s public fusillade against leaks is just the latest example of efforts to use the media to let Trump know Sessions and his department are putting their shoulder to the wheel on issues near and dear to the president, like fighting drugs, gangs and illegal immigration. Last week, a top Justice Department official made an unusual appearance in the White House briefing room \u2014 just feet from the Oval Office \u2014 to talk about the battle against the violent gang MS-13.\u000a\u000aOne challenge for Sessions in trying to win the president over on the leaks issue is that Trump gets much of his information through Fox News.\u000a\u000aWhile the network\u2019s pro-defense, national security bent might ordinarily make it an ally in the war on leaks, Sessions\u2019 talk of making more aggressive efforts toward the media could raise hackles at the network.\u000a\u000aFox and many on the right erupted in anger in 2013 after it was disclosed that during a leak investigation the Justice Department obtained a warrant to search Fox reporter James Rosen\u2019s emails \u2014 and that prosecutors got the warrant by branding Rosen as a co-conspirator in an effort to violate federal law.\u000a\u000aWhile Rosen\u2019s source was indicted and ultimately pleaded guilty, Rosen was never charged with a crime. However, the episode was one of two prominent cases that led President Barack Obama to promise that reporters would not be jailed for doing their jobs. It also prompted Obama\u2019s attorney general, Eric Holder, to make it harder for prosecutors to subpoena reporters or seek their phone or email records \u2014 tightening the very policies that Sessions is now threatening to loosen again.\u000a\u000aRosen declined to comment on Sessions\u2019 proposal. A Fox News spokeswoman had no immediate response to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aAnother topic that seemed to get little attention Friday was the fact that leak prosecutions broke records during the Obama administration. There were some allusions to the fact that the issue has been one the government has tried to crack down on before.\u000a\u000aSessions noted that an \u201cinsider threat\u201d task force was set up in 2011 to address leaks. \u201cProgress has been made, and we intend to reach new levels of effectiveness,\u201d the attorney general said.\u000a\u000aRosenstein did mention that he handled a couple of the cases brought in recent years, including the prosecution of Gen. James \u201cHoss\u201d Cartwright.\u000a\u000aRosenstein acknowledged that the hurdle in getting clearance to proceed with that case was not clearance to probe media communications, but rather the intelligence community\u2019s reluctance to sign off on making details about the case public. (Israel reportedly objected to potential disclosure of its involvement with using the so-called Stuxnet virus against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.)\u000a\u000aCartwright entered a guilty plea last October to a single felony count of lying in the course of the investigation, although prosecutors made clear that they believed he had leaked top secret information to The New York Times and Newsweek.\u000a\u000aIn the off-camera briefing, Rosenstein also passed up a chance to take what could have been an easy shot at Obama. The veteran prosecutor did not note the ultimate outcome of the Cartwright case. Three days before leaving office, Obama granted the Marine general a pardon that wiped out his conviction and eliminated a sentence that could have ranged up to five years in prison.\u000a\u000aJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBERLIN \u2014 Before she fled her home country of Lebanon, Eliana could only find work as an escort. As a trans woman, she faced the constant threat of arrest and torture at Beirut\u2019s notorious Hbeish prison.\u000a\u000aIn Germany, where she applied for asylum in October 2015, Eliana worked at a beauty salon, went to German language classes and wore what she wanted. For the most part, she felt accepted.\u000a\u000aThat feeling of security was shattered earlier this year, when she received a deportation letter from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, known locally by its German acronym, BaMF.\u000a\u000aThe office had rejected her application for asylum on the grounds that Eliana crossed the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece as a man and therefore could not be considered trans, despite reports that women regularly suffer sexual abuse on migrant routes to Europe.\u000a\u000aFor Eliana, who still bears the traces of violence inflicted by family members and acquaintances on her body, the deportation order was a shock. \u201cIt was humiliating,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I had been planning and working on fell apart.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn her Berlin apartment, Eliana rolls down a sock to show me the places where her skin is still stained deep purple. In 2012, Eliana\u2019s brother found out she was trans and gay, and working as an escort. On the first day of Ramadan, he sent his friends to find her. They beat her in the street.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are sending people back for reasons that don\u2019t reflect the reality in their home country\u201d \u2014 Knud Wechterstein, founder of Rainbow Refugees\u000a\u000aScrolling through images she took of her injuries, she shows me an image of her foot, ripped open to reveal slashes of raw flesh. Her ribs and hips still cause her pain, she says.\u000a\u000aSalma Arzouni, a friend who works at Gladt, an organization that supports LGBT asylum seekers, was also surprised by the letter. \u201cHer case was very strong so we didn\u2019t expect this decision at all,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aEliana is one of many LGBT asylum seekers in Germany who have received deportation orders telling them to return to countries considered \u201csafe\u201d by the German government \u2014 but where their lives are still at risk.\u000a\u000aThere are no statistics for the number of LGBT asylum seekers who have received deportation orders, but rights groups report that up to 50 percent of their clients\u2019 applications have been rejected.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s decision-making process does not take into account the specific dangers LGBT people face in their home countries, says Knud Wechterstein, founder of Rainbow Refugees in Frankfurt.\u000a\u000a\u201cBaMF are making a lot of wrong decisions,\u201d he says, leafing through a large binder of letters that explain why his clients \u2014 who come from Iraq, Pakistan, Serbia and Iran \u2014 were refused the right to stay in Germany. A large part of his work involves helping LGBT asylum seekers appeal their deportation orders.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are sending people back for reasons that don\u2019t reflect the reality in their home country.\u201d\u000a\u000aA BaMF spokesperson says the ministry reviews each case individually, considering refugee protection \u201cif the asylum seeker can credibly show that they would be in danger because of their sexual orientation in their country of origin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsylum applications made by Lebanese nationals, for example, are rarely accepted. According to BaMF statistics, in the first half of 2017, under 12 percent of asylum seekers from Lebanon received positive replies. But members of Lebanon\u2019s LGBT community do not feel safe in their country. A 2017 report by Beirut-based equal rights organization Proud Lebanon details incidents of public and police violence, including arrest, torture and prosecutions on the grounds of sexual orientation.\u000a\u000aOfficially, Germany only considers a handful of countries \u2014 EU member countries, the western Balkans, Ghana and Senegal \u2014 as safe. Unofficially, authorities decline to grant asylum to migrants from many other countries, say lawyers and rights groups. And for asylum seekers from Morocco, Pakistan, Russia and Tunisia who are gay or trans, the working assumption that their country is \u201csafe\u201d does not match their own experience of institutional or violent persecution. In Tunisia, for example, same-sex relations are punished by up to three years in prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we see is that LGBT people who don\u2019t come from Syria usually have a lot of difficulties,\u201d says Sabrina Latz, project manager at the Queer Refugees Network based in the east German city of Leipzig. In 2017 so far, over 93 percent of Syrian applicants have been granted asylum, compared to 58 percent of Iraqis and 8 percent of Russians.\u000a\u000aWhen the ministry made a U-turn on an asylum case earlier this year, it became clear to Latz that not all BaMF decisions stand up to public scrutiny.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Lebanon, animals have more rights than trans women\u201d \u2014 Eliana, a trans woman seeking asylum in Germany\u000a\u000aA 29-year-old gay man from Tunisia, who had been forced by police to undergo an anal test \u2014 a practice condemned by the U.N. Committee Against Torture but still used in Tunisia to determine whether a man is gay \u2014 was rejected for asylum in Germany in January. The Queer Refugees Network \u2013 which had supported the man\u2019s case \u2014 made the decision public and drummed up support on social media, prompting BaMF to reopen the case. A month later, it reversed its decision and granted the applicant refugee status.\u000a\u000aThe victory was a rare exception, Latz says, adding that it was not easy to get BaMF to change its mind without consistent public pressure even if the decisions were in large part \u201cnot fair\u201d or \u201chumane.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a recent case, BaMF officials rejected an Iraqi man\u2019s application on the grounds that he is married to a woman and has three children, and that he could therefore not be considered as gay.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe asylum process needs BaMF to be more sensitive towards the topic of LGBTI persecution and the situation inside different countries,\u201d Latz says. \u201cMany of our clients are married because they are not able to live openly as gay men in their home countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to Frankfurt-based migration lawyer Jonathan Leuschner, the gist of German authorities\u2019 argument is often that people are unlikely to face serious persecution in their home countries if they keep their sexual orientation to themselves.\u000a\u000a\u201cYet the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that any such argument poses an infringement on one\u2019s right to the free development of personality,\u201d Leuschner says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI recently received a rejection for an LGBTI applicant from Jamaica \u2014 a country where homosexuality is punished with up to 10 years in jail \u2014 that argued Jamaica does not criminalize homosexuality \u2018as such,\u2019 but \u2018only\u2019 for sexual intercourse and physical intimacy between men,\u201d Leuschner says. \u201cIt is beyond me how one would sustain this differentiation.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aWhile BaMF rejected Eliana\u2019s case on the basis that Lebanon is \u201csafe\u201d for her, she is dreading her return to a country where she has to live in fear.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Lebanon, animals have more rights than trans women,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aEliana chose not to appeal her deportation decision, a process that can take years. \u201cI\u2019ve already lost two years of my life, I can\u2019t wait two more,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aHer friends tried to persuade her to stay, but the deportation order changed her perception of German hospitality. \u201cI would rather live on the street than be humiliated here.\u201d\u000a\u000aMorgan Meaker is a freelance human rights journalist covering minorities in Europe and the Middle East.

aVIf one follows the political debate over a divisive issue for a long time, it is not rare to see ideological advocates switch to making arguments they would never have made years earlier. The political environment changed, and the claims that need to be made to further the ideological objective must change as well.\u000a\u000aMaybe it\u2019s just me because I instinctively read in between the lines whenever I read anything about immigration, but I\u2019m beginning to detect such a seismic shift in the immigration debate. We all know the party line by now: Immigrants do jobs that natives don\u2019t want to do. As a result, natives do not lose jobs, and natives do not see their wages reduced. And anyone who claims otherwise is obviously a racist xenophobic moron. They obviously don\u2019t like immigrants, and they obviously are not educated/credentialed enough to understand and appreciate expert opinion.\u000a\u000aThe flurry of immigration restrictions proposed by the Trump administration demands a switch in tactics\u2013with a corresponding switch in the argument linking immigration and wages. The party line must now be that less immigration is bad. But how can one show that in simple-to-grasp economic terms that can be mass-marketed to the masses? By far the simplest way is to come up with examples that less immigration raises labor costs and makes us miserable because everything becomes more expensive.\u000a\u000aI first noticed the tactical switch back in March when the Washington Post published a story headlined After decades in America, the newly deported return to a Mexico they barely recognize, The point of the story, of course, was to imply that Trump\u2019s deportation initiatives are bad because they are making Mexicans worse off. And how exactly are Mexicans made worse off?\u000a\u000aMore returnees means lower wages for everybody in blue-collar industries such as construction and automobile manufacturing, where competition for jobs is likely to increase, economists say.\u000a\u000aI love the \u201ceconomists say\u201d add-on. Too bad that those economic experts remain unnamed. But don\u2019t be shocked if they are the same exact economic experts who have been claiming the same exact opposite for two or three decades in the context of the American labor market.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s this story in a local New England paper. The goal again is to demonstrate the economic costs created by Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions. The Bangor Daily News article is headlined Amid foreign worker shortage, Bar Harbor businesses turn to local labor. The article starts off by noting that \u201cBusinesses in Maine that rely on summer help are hoping that Congress will come to the rescue.\u201d And what do these businesses have to be rescued from? Higher wages, of course.\u000a\u000aBecause of new limits on the seasonal worker visa program, restaurants, hotels and other tourist-centered operations are scrambling to find seasonal employees. Until Congress opens the door to more H-2B foreign workers\u2026Bar Harbor area employers are enticing workers in other ways. Higher wages are part of the solution.\u000a\u000aThe Dallas Morning News joins in the fun with a story blaming the immigration slowdown for higher housing prices. The story is headlined One Reason for Dallas\u2019 soaring home prices and labor shortage: Immigrants aren\u2019t coming to work:\u000a\u000aDallas home prices are climbing rapidly, and homebuilders are complaining about labor shortages and soaring wages for construction workers.\u000a\u000aDuh! Who could have possibly guessed that fewer construction workers meant higher construction wages?\u000a\u000aFinally, the highly credentialed economic experts at the Federal Reserve are out in force documenting just how costly the immigration-related actions of the Trump administration are. In a recent Bloomberg article headlined Fed Officials Sharpen Concerns Over Trump\u2019s Immigration Policy, those credentialed experts expertly make the point:\u000a\u000aPatrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, became the latest policy maker to call attention to the struggles of companies in finding low-skilled labor\u2026The Chicago Fed said one manufacturing firm raised wages 10 percent to attract better applicants and improve retention of unskilled workers. A freight trucking firm in Cleveland reported granting raises of almost 8 percent in an attempt to retain workers.\u000a\u000aThere is no upper bound to the hypocrisy of experts. It might be a lot of fun to keep track of this over the next few years, watching the dominos fall and all those \u201cimmigration-does-not-affect-wages\u201d experts fall all over themselves as they switch to proving the economic awfulness of Trump\u2019s actions because fewer immigrants mean higher labor costs, higher prices, more inflation.\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t hold your breath for any admission that they were wrong in the past. They will instantly switch to the former party line the minute the Trump immigration restrictions fade into history.

aVVolkswagen fraudulently secured \u20ac400 million in loans from the European Investment Bank to develop the engine at the heart of the Dieselgate scandal, according to officials at the EU anti-fraud watchdog OLAF.\u000a\u000aThe results of the fraud probe are another blow to the reputation of the German car industry, following the Dieselgate revelations in 2015 and reports in the last few weeks that the big five players in the sector colluded secretly to thwart competition. Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the car companies Sunday they had \u201ca damned responsibility to rebuild trust and fix mistakes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe OLAF investigation, concluded in the past few days, delved back into Dieselgate, when VW fitted engines with so-called defeat devices, or software that enabled diesel cars to perform far better in emissions tests in a laboratory than in real driving conditions. VW admitted that 11 million cars had installed the illegal software, enabling them to spew out more poisonous nitrogen oxides (NOx) than tests suggested they would.\u000a\u000aOLAF officials said they opened a case in November 2015 to look into financing granted to VW in 2009 by the EIB, the EU mega-bank largely dedicated to infrastructure and development projects. The loan was supposed to help the world\u2019s biggest carmaker develop an engine that would comply with increasingly stringent emissions rules in the EU and the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe EU investigators concluded, however, that VW secured the loan by \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeception.\u201d\u000a\u000aOLAF\u2019s chief complaint was that the money was channeled toward VW\u2019s EA 189 diesel engine, although senior company employees knew that this model would only meet its emissions targets by using a defeat device. The EU investigators argued that VW failed to disclose this to the lender, and added that the EIB would not have granted the loan if it been fully briefed, according to officials familiar with the probe.\u000a\u000aThe EU investigators did not find, however, that EIB money had been used directly for creating defeat devices \u2014 which had been a subject of press speculation in the past 18 months.\u000a\u000aRecommendation to prosecutors\u000a\u000aOLAF itself cannot take judicial action. Instead, it has sent recommendations to public prosecutors in Braunschweig, who are leading criminal inquiries into VW, asking them to take its findings into consideration.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for the EU watchdog added it had also told the EIB to take \u201cactive steps\u201d in implementing its anti-fraud policy.\u000a\u000aIt did not, however, recommend that any money should be clawed back from VW, because the carmaker had already paid back the loan in 2014, the spokesperson added.\u000a\u000aBraunschweig prosecutors\u2019 office did not respond to requests for comment. The EIB said it was weighing up OLAF\u2019s conclusions \u201cto determine more precise appropriate action.\u201d\u000a\u000aVW did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThe EU watchdog\u2019s case centered on two senior employees, Richard Dorenkamp and Thorsten Duersterdiek, according to the officials briefed on the case.\u000a\u000aThe investigation found that the two men were aware that shortcomings of the EA 189 engine meant that they would need to cheat to meet emissions targets. This information was withheld from the EIB in applying for the loan, and for the whole duration of the financing.\u000a\u000aBefore granting the loan, the EIB specifically requested information from VW about the environmental impact of the project to be funded, and received an email stating how the projects \u201cwere components of VW aspiration to become the most innovative mass car manufacturers with an emphasis on further reduction of emissions and fuel consumption.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn February 2011, once the EIB-funded project was completed, VW even sent material to the lender boasting of how successful it had been in slashing emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe main result, to produce fuel efficient and reliable vehicles as well as complying with new EU legislation to reduce car emissions, has been fulfilled. Therefore, the project was consistent with the Bank\u2019s policy on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe project has been implemented according to the technical description. The results are very satisfactory with carbon dioxide emissions reduction of up to 20 percent, NOx emissions reductions of up to 30 percent and particle emissions reduction superior to 90 percent for the diesel engines,\u201d VW was quoted as saying in the EIB project completion report of December 2011.

aVLISBON \u2014 After the best part of a decade of recession and stagnation, Portugal finally looked to be getting back on its feet. Then it all went wrong.\u000a\u000aIn June, just one day after the country had been freed from eight years of EU-imposed austerity measures, forest fires swept through the country, killing 64 people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Portuguese people have been shaken by the greatest catastrophe of recent decades,\u201d Prime Minister António Costa told parliament in his State of the Nation speech. \u201cIn less than 24 hours we passed from relief to turmoil, from satisfaction to consternation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fires weren\u2019t the only crisis that Costa\u2019s government had to deal with over the summer as the mood turned somber in a country that had been on a roll after being crowned European football champions for the first time last summer, had crooned its way to victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, and got its man placed at the head of the United Nations.\u000a\u000aTwo weeks after the fires, the nation\u2019s self-confidence suffered another blow when thieves broke into a military base northeast of Lisbon.\u000a\u000aTheir haul reportedly included 44 rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons, 150 hand grenades, 264 blocks of plastic explosives, dozens of detonators and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears\u201d \u2014 Opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho\u000a\u000aAs rumors circulated that the weapons were destined for international terrorists or organized crime gangs, the heist was viewed as a national humiliation that undermined the trust of NATO allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis calls into question the prestige of Portugal, the prestige of the armed forces, the authority of the state and the security of the Portuguese people,\u201d Marcelo Rebel de Sousa, Portugal\u2019s figurehead president, said after the theft at the base at Tancos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m demanding a full and complete investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be done no matter who it hurts, and nobody is immune.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta faced demands for cabinet resignations as his Socialist (PS) government and the center-right opposition traded accusations over who was to blame for defense cuts that left the army with unguarded perimeter fences and broken surveillance systems; greed-driven forestry regimes that made the countryside flammable; chaotic civil defense planning; and investments in dysfunctional communication systems that hindered warnings as walls of flame roared toward defenseless villages and crowded highways.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister himself was lambasted for vacationing in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands as security concerns and political tensions rose amid the fallout from the arms heist.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears,\u201d opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho told supporters of his center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD). \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of leadership and a lack of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta resisted calls to fire his interior and defense ministers, but then faced a further blow when three junior ministers resigned as the state prosecutors\u2019 office was poised to formally name them in an investigation into all-expenses-paid trips to last year\u2019s European football championship in France, allegedly offered by Galp Energeia, a power company.\u000a\u000aPopularity persists\u000a\u000aMinisters acknowledge the government is facing its most difficult time since coming to power in November 2015.\u000a\u000aStill, the Socialists have hit back, claiming that problems behind the fires and the robbery lie with the austerity-driven policies of the previous government led by Passos Coelho. The center-right has also been embarrassed by reports that three of its elected officials accepted a junket paid for by Chinese tech company Huawei.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down\u201d \u2014 Political expert André Azevedo Alves\u000a\u000aSo far, the gloom appears to have done little to hurt the government\u2019s popularity.\u000a\u000aCosta remains by far the most popular party leader. He enjoys a 48.9 percent approval rating, according to a poll published Saturday in the weekly Expresso newspaper. With a drop of just 0.6 points over the past two months, he\u2019s way ahead of Passos Coelho on 39.2 percent.\u000a\u000aThe PS has even increased its lead. Saturday\u2019s poll had the party at 40.8 percent, up 0.4 percent on July. The PSD dropped back to 28.1 percent.\u000a\u000aNor is there any sign that voters disaffected by the summer crises are turning to the two far-left parties that shore up Costa\u2019s minority government.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) is on 7.6 percent and the Left Bloc (BE) on 8.4 percent. Both have been steadily losing support since the October 2015 general election that brought Costa to power.\u000a\u000aHowever, analysts say the summer events could still take their toll.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen any really substantial impact on the polls, but this could mark a turning point over the longer term,\u201d said André Azevedo Alves, a political expert at Lisbon\u2019s Catholic University of Portugal and St. Mary\u2019s University, London.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tragic scale of the fires and the manner of the robbery at Tancos reflects on the institutions of state and could have a corrosive effect,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until now everything appeared to be going well under this government, we\u2019d been exceeding expectations, now things are going worse than expected.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeftists flex their muscles\u000a\u000aCosta now faces two crucial mid-term tests: Nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October 1 and the opening on August 21 of negotiations with his far-left partners on next year\u2019s state budget.\u000a\u000aThe leftists are demanding concessions. After two years of waving through budget bills that have won EU plaudits and brought the deficit down to its lowest level since democracy was restored in 1974, they\u2019re demanding a faster roll back of austerity.\u000a\u000aLeft Bloc leader Catarina Martins has been addressing party rallies around the country, cranking up pressure over the budget. Her demands range from tax breaks for the low earners to lowering the retirement age and more money for civil servants, pensions and public services.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a country where a mother who works full time and earns the minimum wage lives in poverty because the wage is so low that she cannot support herself and her child,\u201d Martins told a rally Thursday in Monte Gordo, a popular vacation resort in the southern Algarve region. \u201cNobody should be left behind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe very public demands of both far-left parties will make it harder to strike a deal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down,\u201d said Azevedo Alves. \u201cThere are ways out of this, but it will be more of a challenge than in previous years.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the rosier economic climate, unions are also demanding more.\u000a\u000aWorkers at the Autoeuropa car plant \u2014 the country\u2019s third biggest exporter \u2014 are threatening a strike to interrupt production of Volkswagen\u2019s new T-ROC model. They voted to reject a deal on wages and working time which, the company said, included a 16 percent pay rise for some workers.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.\u000a\u000aVenezuela is another source of tension between the government and its hard-left backers.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communists on Thursday issued a statement denouncing protests against Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro as \u201cdestabilizing, terrorist and putschist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe PCP criticized Costa\u2019s government for signing up to the European Union position not recognizing the violence-marred elections that Maduro organized to boost his powers.\u000a\u000aDespite the strains, however, neither the PCP nor the Left Bloc have much interest in breaking up the governing partnership, which is popularly nicknamed the geringonça, or contraption.\u000a\u000aIf they rock the boat too much, they risk being shunted away from power in new elections, given that polls show the PS within reach of an absolute majority, and voters would likely penalize any party that provokes a crisis by pulling out of the governing deal.\u000a\u000aThat strengthens Costa\u2019s hand in the budget talks.\u000a\u000aThe local elections will choose mayors and councillors for the country\u2019s 308 municipalities and over 3,000 smaller parish councils. Races are often dominated by local issues and personalities, but the vote will be a barometer of national support for the parties and their leaders.\u000a\u000aCosta is hoping the Socialists will increase their current leadership of 150 municipalities, and most of all they want to hang on to Lisbon, where he served as a popular mayor before stepping down in 2015 to run for the premiership.\u000a\u000aFernando Medina, Costa\u2019s successor as mayor, has been riding on a tourism boom, investing in a spate of urban embellishment projects to give the capital a facelift. The party\u2019s national ratings have also been boosted by strong economic data.\u000a\u000aLatest Eurostat numbers released last week showed Portugal\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below the eurozone average for the first time since the crisis; growth, which is predicted at over 2.5 percent this year, will be the \u201cbest this century,\u201d according to Costa; and 2017 is on course to be the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for tourist numbers.\u000a\u000aThe PSD\u2019s challenge hasn\u2019t started well. It\u2019s challenger in the Lisbon mayoral race, Teresa Leal Coelho, made a gaffe-plagued opening to her campaign \u2014 confusing Passos Coelho with a previous party leader; making promises to abolish taxes that are beyond the mayor\u2019s remit; and releasing campaign posters apparently missing their slogans.\u000a\u000aThe party has also suffered a high-profile spat over Passos Coelho\u2019s refusal to disown a candidate running in the commuter town of Loures who spouted pejorative remarks about the local Roma community.\u000a\u000aRivals within the PSD have been sharpening their knives for Passos Coelho ever since he lost the premiership in 2015. A poor showing in October could see the former prime minister ousted.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.

aVLONDON \u2014 The U.K. may be leaving the EU but some British MPs want to adopt the European Parliament\u2019s voting system on their way out the door.\u000a\u000aRelations between government and opposition whips \u2014 backbench MPs tasked with corralling their parties to back their leaders in votes in the House of Commons \u2014 have gone into \u201cdeep freeze\u201d since the June 8 election in which Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority, according to MPs on both sides. Conventions that eased the passing of legislation by enabling MPs to miss votes without disadvantaging their own side have been cast aside now that every vote is on a knife edge.\u000a\u000aVotes in the Commons \u2014 known as divisions \u2014 can take place at almost any time. Whenever a question is put to a vote, the Speaker asks MPs to call out to indicate whether or not they support the motion and if there are cries of \u201cNo!\u201d a formal division is held. MPs must then be physically present to walk through corridors on either side of the chamber to record their vote. Now that the Conservatives no longer have a majority in parliament, Labour hopes to frustrate Tory MPs with the threat of surprise votes.\u000a\u000aMaria Miller, a Tory MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, said the British parliament should reform its \u201coutdated\u201d voting system and switch to a similar process to the one used by the European Parliament, where votes are generally deferred and held around midday during plenary sessions with members sometimes voting on hundreds of amendments at once.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt feels as if we were re-enacting the D-day landings, and trying to adopt guerrilla tactics, which, in my 12 years of being in parliament, have never worked\u201d \u2014 Maria Miller, Tory MP\u000a\u000aMPs should not be forced to sit there to \u201ccounter underhand tactics from the opposition, or indeed any other quarter,\u201d Miller told POLITICO. The move would make parliament more productive, and allow MPs to get on with serving their constituents, she added.\u000a\u000aThe conventional pairing system \u2014 in which whips agree to match MPs with a counterpart from the opposing side when both need to be absent \u2014 was not put in place after the general election in June. A source close to the Labour whipping operation said there was no guarantee they would agree to this kind of arrangement.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not support the idea that a vote at the end of every day, sometimes in the wee small hours of the morning, gives anyone the edge \u2026 It feels as if we were re-enacting the D-day landings, and trying to adopt guerrilla tactics, which, in my 12 years of being in parliament, have never worked,\u201d Miller said in a House of Commons debate in July.\u000a\u000aAmbush\u000a\u000aThe snap general election, which left May eight seats short of a majority in the House of Commons, made it almost impossible for her MPs to miss votes. A deal with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party allowed the prime minister to hang on but only with a working majority of 13, not comfortable enough to risk defeat, even on trivial or procedural matters that wouldn\u2019t topple her government but could frustrate the passage of her legislative program through the House.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is going to be incredibly difficult for ministers to get away at all, let alone backbenchers,\u201d said backbench Tory MP Keith Simpson. \u201cIf this goes on for six months or a year you are going to get some frustration.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo make matters worse, the government is under pressure to pass eight Brexit bills by the time the U.K. leaves the European Union, scheduled for March 2019.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe advantage we have is they [the Tories] don\u2019t know what the battle will be,\u201d a Labour MP said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t vote at the end. Tory MPs will become very disgruntled having to sit there for an hour and a half when there isn\u2019t a vote at the end of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that the objective needn\u2019t always be to defeat the government. Even if the Tories \u201cwon by a big margin\u201d because Labour allowed some of its own MPs to miss a vote it would compound the government\u2019s woes.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom a government whip\u2019s point of view they will get furious people running into their whips office saying \u2018you brought me back from Timbuktu you bastard and we won by 50.\u2019 So actually messing them about isn\u2019t just about winning, or the threat of winning, you can lose decisively and it causes them more problems than it causes us,\u201d the MP said.\u000a\u000aMPs on both sides said, as a result, friendly MPs across the political divide may try to make their own whipping arrangements \u2014 something frowned on by the formal party whips.\u000a\u000aClash of party machines\u000a\u000aLabour\u2019s confidence stems, in part, from the experience of their whipping operation.\u000a\u000aNick Brown \u2014 who replaced Rosie Winterton as chief Labour whip \u2014 served as a whip in the last Labour government. Another senior member of the team, Mark Tami, was a Treasury whip in the last Labour government and has been an opposition whip since 2010.\u000a\u000aThe Tory operation, on the other hand, was weakened by the departure of Anne Milton, who was deputy chief whip before the election. Her promotion to the Department for Education is seen by some in Labour as a tactical error, particularly given her strength at building alliances across the political divide.\u000a\u000aA lack of provision of opposition day debates \u2014 where opposition parties are able to propose a motion and call a vote \u2014 and a dispute over the number of Friday sittings has further soured relations between the two sides, according to the Labour MP.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is all very well them saying they want things back to normal and then they do things like that,\u201d the MP said.

aVNational security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has waged a pitched battle with other senior staff for control over policy and personnel on the National Security Council, is taking advantage of the shield offered by the arrival of his old military colleague John Kelly as White House chief of staff.\u000a\u000aKelly told McMaster this week that he wanted him to remain as national security adviser, said two senior White House aides, and has encouraged him to make any staffing changes he deems necessary. McMaster took that as a green light this week to oust top intelligence aide Ezra Cohen-Watnick \u2014 a Michael Flynn hire who has a warm relationship with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law \u2014 after months of trying.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aKelly's arrival did not lead directly to Cohen-Watnick's dismissal, officials said, but was months in the making.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, a three-star general who was enlisted by Trump to replace Flynn in February, has been an increasingly volatile presence in the West Wing, operating under a cloud of rumors that Trump, with whom he is said to have a testy relationship, was considering reassigning him to another post, possibly sending him to oversee the war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials who have had direct interaction with him, McMaster has bristled at White House aides close to Trump whom he perceives as undercutting his authority. He seethes over every national security leak and lashes out over negative news stories he thinks are spread by his enemies. And McMaster, whose temper is legendary, frequently blows his top in high-level meetings.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe can be very intense,\u201d a McMaster confidant who speaks with him regularly and is a major supporter, told POLITICO Thursday. \u201cSome find that difficult.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster is fiercely at odds with Steve Bannon, the Trump strategist who was removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council in April after McMaster\u2019s appointment. In mid-July, the two sparred openly, in a widely attended policy meeting about Afghanistan, with McMaster advocating greater U.S. involvement and Bannon arguing for a major pullback.\u000a\u000aMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe dispute got so out of hand, according to a pair of senior White House officials, that Secretary of Defense James Mattis had to intervene to get the discussion back on track.\u000a\u000aWhile he has occasionally clashed with Kushner, the influential son-in-law, has a better relationship with him these days, a White House official with direct knowledge said.\u000a\u000aThe officials also said that McMaster fumes that he believes Bannon is responsible for leaking negative information about him to the news media \u2014 including via Breitbart.com, the far-right news site Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign in 2016.\u000a\u000aSeveral of the officials, who like others spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of losing their jobs, said McMaster, who holds a Ph.D. in American history, remains on shaky ground with Trump, who they said wants to keep him -- for now.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for McMaster declined to address questions about McMaster's relationship with key White House officials and his plans in the days ahead.\u000a\u000aMcMaster has steadily changed the complexion of the top White House policy shop in the past six months, going after people brought into the NSC by Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after failing to be truthful to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.\u000a\u000aOfficials say McMaster had a leading role in pushing out K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News analyst and Reagan administration official who served as Flynn's deputy and has been nominated to be ambassador to Singapore. He ousted the top Middle East adviser, an Iran hawk, replacing him with a retired Army colonel and military academic. Another top aide was dismissed after penning a memo that accused globalists, bankers and the \u201cdeep state\u201d of undermining Trump \u2014 somethingMcMaster saw as trafficking in conspiracy theories.\u000a\u000aHis assault on those whom some have derided as \u201cFlynnstones\u201d reached its pinnacle on Wednesday when he removed Cohen-Watnick. He had been trying to push him out at least since March, when it was alleged in some reports that without authorization he shared classified information with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who at the time was leading the House investigation of potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Other reported accounts disputed that Cohen-Watnick shared the information with Nunes.\u000a\u000aYet for at least a few weeks, Kushner and others close to Cohen-Watnick have tried to land him a different job, knowing his days at the NSC were probably numbered.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, several of the officials related, was overruled by Kushner and Bannon when he first sought to fire Cohen-Watnick, and he seethed about his inability to get rid of Cohen-Watnick when an article appeared in The Atlantic last month titled \u201cThe Man McMaster Couldn't Fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster has prevailed in some fierce policy fights \u2014 part of a broader battle between Trump administration officials with a more establishment and internationalist worldview, like Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 to prevail over the more nationalist vision espoused by Bannon and Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka.\u000a\u000aMcMaster has achieved some big victories, like preventing Trump from using the controversial phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d that Flynn insisted upon and getting the president to explicitly endorse the NATO charter\u2019s Article 5 \u2014 which commits the United States to the defend its European allies \u2014 after sending mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to the alliance.\u000a\u000aBut McMaster was excluded from Trump\u2019s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month at the G-20 summit in Germany, has failed to convince Trump to send more troops to Afghanistan, and was barely able to keep the president from ditching the Obama-era deal with Iran to halt its nuclear weapons program.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a split in the White House between the Bannon camp of ideologues and the McMaster-Mattis-Tillerson camp of more centrist intellectuals,\u201d said Pete Mansoor, a retired Army colonel who worked closely with McMaster and now teaches at Ohio State University. \u201cAnd this conflict is playing out in real time as the Trump administration tries to flesh out its foreign policy and national security policy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe centrists appear to be winning the battle,\u201d Mansoor added. \u201cBut not always.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite what he has accomplished, McMaster is clearly still very much under fire.\u000a\u000aHe is accused by his detractors of trying to undercut the president's agenda and has been the subject of a series of negative news stories that he blames on his enemies in the West Wing \u2014 especially Bannon, who people close to him say he believes was behind a recent string of stories on Breitbart that accuse him, among other things, of being anti-Israel.\u000a\u000aBefore his White House arrival, McMaster was a darling of the media. His best-selling 1997 book, an indictment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the early years of the Vietnam War, gained him a reputation as one of the Army's leading thinkers.\u000a\u000aHis later exploits as commander of an armored cavalry regiment near the Syrian border in 2006 formed the building blocks of the counterinsurgency strategy that underpinned the surge of American forces a year later to tamp down a sectarian war \u2014 and earned him public accolades from President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aBut in spite of all that \u2014 or because of it \u2014 he had his share of detractors inside the ranks. As an iconoclast he rubbed many of the top generals, who also saw him as a publicity hound, the wrong way. It is unlikely he would have ever been promoted to general had it not been for a mentor named David Petraeus, the most accomplished general of his generation and another leading "warrior-intellectual."\u000a\u000aIn the White House, McMaster finds the fierce public scrutiny grating, according several of his close supporters, including articles that have suggested he sullied his reputation by agreeing to work for Trump in the first place and for defending him publicly \u2014 particularly when he went to bat for his boss after reports that Trump shared classified information with visiting Russian officials in the Oval Office.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how much of H.R.\u2019s reported troubles are real and how much are just crafted by his enemies inside the White House,\u201d said Douglas Ollivant, a retired Army officer who served with McMaster in Iraq and is now a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank. "It\u2019s difficult to know what reality is.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother salvo was launched at McMaster on Thursday, after the Washington Post published embarrassing transcripts of Trump's calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico, citing the National Security Council.\u000a\u000aA conservative activist group immediately called for his ouster.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are in charge of something and can\u2019t keep control of your own staff, you lose your job,\u201d said Rick Manning, a former official in the Bush administration and now president of the nonpartisan Americans for Limited Government, which blasted out a news release calling on Trump to fire his national security adviser. "He has lost control of the national security apparatus.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut McMaster's supporters are certainly not counting him out yet and said his approach may ultimately win over who counts the most: Trump, who admires his hard-charging but thorough approach.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe does respect those who produce at the end of the day and come in with a well-thought-out plan,\u201d said the confidant. \u201cMcMaster knows how to run a rigorous process. He seriously wants America to achieve its objectives and to provide the president thoroughly developed, integrated policy options.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVMark Zuckerberg insists he's not running for president. But just like your finely tuned privacy settings, things in Facebook Land are never quite what they seem.\u000a\u000aOr so hopes the newly formed super PAC Disrupt for America, whose purpose is to convince the boy king of Silicon Valley not so much to abdicate his throne as to augment it.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the group wants the Zuck to run for president in 2020. Like, really badly. So badly that it has taken upon itself the task of fomenting what has to be the most significantly misguided wave of peer pressure this country has seen in at least six months.\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: No, Mark Zuckerberg isn\u2019t running for office\u2014his tour is much bigger than that\u000a\u000a"We are committed to convincing the American people to convince Mark Zuckerberg to consider a Presidential run in 2020," the groups states on its website, "or at least join the conversation."\u000a\u000aWe had sooooo many questions, and called up the PAC's treasurer as listed on its FEC statement of organization with the hope of getting some answers. The treasurer, Rodney Giles, declined to go on the record but did direct us to Disrupt for America's press arm. Unfortunately, just like Zuckerberg's effort to discover what it's like to be human, that effort went nowhere.\u000a\u000aOur SuperPAC is designed to provide \u2018resistance with a purpose and & plan\u2019 as well as the goal of drafting Mark Zuckerberg #DraftZuck2020 \u2014 Disrupt For America (@Disrupt4America) May 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBut that's OK, because there is a wealth of information on the group's site \u2014 like the fact that Zuckerberg, in many ways, is already presidential. How do we know this? Why, because of all the qualities he shares with our current president Donald J. Trump, of course.\u000a\u000a"In addition to a set of steadfast liberal principals," the website notes, "Mark shares (perhaps more legitimately) many of the qualities of Donald Trump that resonated with everyday Americans \u2013 a wealthy, anti-establishment outsider unbeholden to special interests."\u000a\u000aOh good.\u000a\u000aLike many things in the world of politics, Disrupt for America's goal of drafting Zuckerberg is probably a long shot. Or at least we should all hope it is, because if his blandly apolitical 50-state tour has taught us anything, it's that the man is fundamentally incapable of taking any kind of meaningful stand.\u000a\u000aAnd while that may have suited Zuckerberg in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, it didn't end up working out so well for the rest of us.

aVThe egg pollution scandal has prompted new investigations into chicken meat | Sascha Schuermann/Getty Images Euro-Press Review As egg contamination scandal deepens, Dutch investigate chicken meat French MPs are unusually busy, German politicians call for tighter controls on VW, and Brits worry about slipping border security standards, in today\u2019s European press.\u000a\u000aFrance\u000a\u000aAccording to Le Monde, French President Emmanuel Macron is preparing for an intensive political period when parliament reconvenes after summer, in particular on social and budgetary policies. In Macron\u2019s first 100 days in office, parliament has voted on three laws and pushed through several reforms \u2014 an unprecedented track record in French politics. But, Le Monde writes, Macron wants his MPs to be more upfront with the media about progress made. \u201cYou should be proud of the record that you have to defend,\u201d Macron said.\u000a\u000aLe Figaro had a front page story on the hurdles faced by Brits trying to obtain dual nationality to make sure they can stay in the EU after Brexit. As it turns out, applying for a second citizenship is not that easy \u2014 and in fact not legally possible in nine out of 28 member states.\u000a\u000aGermany\u000a\u000aThe German state of Lower Saxony will elect a new parliament on October 15, three weeks after the federal election in Germany, Die Welt and FAZ reported. The government crisis started when a Green MP decided to switch parties and join the conservative CDU, causing the government to lose its narrow majority. In the meantime, state premier Stephan Weil has come under intense scrutiny for his dealings with Volkswagen. The CDU has called for tighter controls on the carmaker, including regulation of supervisory board seats, German papers reported. And the Free Democrats (FDP), also vying for a chance to lead the regional government in October, said Lower Saxony should give up its stakes in Volkswagen, according to a Zeit report.\u000a\u000aFAZ also wrote that Porsche is investigating whether diesel engines in a new car type could be replaced, possibly drawing on lessons taken from the ongoing diesel emissions scandal.\u000a\u000aThe Netherlands\u000a\u000aThe egg pollution scandal has prompted new investigations into chicken meat, AD reported. Food authority NVWA is investigating whether the chemical fipronil can also be found in other products after it learned that the cleaning company using the prohibited insecticide also worked for a number of meat companies. The poultry industry claims there are no traces of fipronil to be found in meat.\u000a\u000aFD wrote about the French coastal town of Calais, where people are bracing themselves for a new migration crisis. Ten months after the notorious refugee camp, the so-called \u201cJungle,\u201d was cleared, new ones are on the brink of being built. Some 1,000 migrants from Africa, Afghanistan and Iraq are sleeping rough in and around the city.\u000a\u000aUK\u000a\u000aThe Guardian led with a report on a U.S. government appeal to officials to use the term \u201cweather extremes\u201d instead of \u201cclimate change.\u201d The department of agriculture\u2019s natural resources conservation service sent a list of terms that should be avoided by administration staff members, according to the report. \u201cClimate change\u201d is in the \u201cavoid\u201d category. Instead of \u201cclimate change adaption,\u201d staff have been told to use \u201cresilience to weather extremes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Times reported that members of government are worried over Home Office plans to scrap landing cards for millions of visitors from outside Europe arriving at airports and ports in the U.K. \u2014 a move aimed at speeding up passport controls. The government warned Monday night that the plan, set to take effect October 1, could undermine border security. Without landing cards, non-EU passengers will no longer have to reveal where they are staying in Britain, or for how long.

aVNo wonder Belgium is panicking.\u000a\u000aA snowballing health scandal over a poisonous insecticide in eggs has revived the specter of a massive political crisis in 1999 that brought down the government.\u000a\u000aBelgium will convene an emergency session of ministers in parliament Wednesday to determine whether it can still rely on the food safety apparatus created nearly 20 years ago to prevent a rerun of the dioxin crisis, which is now etched into Belgians\u2019 memories.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, toxic dioxins entered the food chain through animal feed via an oil and fat recycling company in Flanders: Vetsmelter Verkest. Health authorities sat on the information for months, leading to accusations from then-opposition leader Guy Verhofstadt of a premeditated cover-up. Ministers resigned, shoppers panicked, demand for dairy products dried up and pigs were slaughtered. Neighboring countries lambasted Belgium\u2019s opacity and France banned a wide range of Belgian food items.\u000a\u000aFast forward two decades, and Belgium is again in the thick of it, and many of the same problems of poor communication are re-emerging, with Germany especially furious about the lack of information it is receiving.\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aThe latest crisis hinges on a poison called fipronil that has contaminated eggs across several EU countries, thanks to an illegal mite-killing detergent for chickens made by a company in Flanders called Poultry Vision. While tests identifying a \u201cserious\u201d risk were first conducted in May and an investigation was opened in June, the public was only informed at the end of July, and then only because of concerns in the Netherlands. Across the EU, hundreds of farms have closed and sales of tens of millions of eggs have been halted.\u000a\u000aFipronil can damage organs ranging from the liver to the thyroid gland, and it\u2019s especially harmful to children.\u000a\u000aBelgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme and Health Minister Maggie De Block will try to explain Belgium\u2019s handling of the crisis to parliamentarians Wednesday. Ducarme has called for a detailed report from Belgium\u2019s Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) and prioritized consumer safety.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission said Monday that seven countries may be affected.\u000a\u000aGermany, which fears it has imported millions of contaminated eggs, is the most vocal critic. Regional officials angrily accused the Belgians of not picking up the phone and of not being \u201cup to the job.\u201d The agriculture ministry in Berlin said Christian Schmidt, Germany\u2019s farm minister, called his Belgian counterpart Monday to demand \u201ca fast and complete clarification of the ongoing situation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTurbid timeline\u000a\u000aMuch of the appraisal of the scandal will hinge on its messy chronology.\u000a\u000aAFSCA said it was informed in early June that traces of fipronil had made it into the food chain via eggs. But the agency failed to notify its partners in Europe of the scandal for nearly two months.\u000a\u000aThe frustration with the Belgian authorities is shaping into the biggest black mark against the country\u2019s administration since its intelligence networks were widely accused, especially by French President François Hollande, of failing to identify the terrorist networks behind attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aAccording to an official notification form filed by the Belgian state, the sampling of the contaminated eggs took place May 15. However it wasn\u2019t until July 20 that Belgium informed its European partners via the EU\u2019s so-called Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Only on August 1 did AFSCA make its first public announcement on the issue.\u000a\u000aKatrien Stragier, a spokesperson AFSCA, said the May 15 date referred to the day that a private egg producer in Belgium conducted its own tests to check for fipronil. It was not until early June that AFSCA was informed.\u000a\u000aThijs Verbeurgt, head of the policy unit for the Flemish Social-Democratic Party, said \u201cThe big question is who knew what when.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been feeling is that they [Belgium\u2019s food safety authority] took a minimalist approach, minimal [communication] and minimal action, while in the Netherlands and Germany they\u2019ve been taking maximal steps,\u201d Verbeurgt said. \u201cThat means destroying eggs and chickens in the interests of the consumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aQuestions about measuring egg safety\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aIn Germany\u2019s view, dangerous eggs have been found in Belgium. According to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany, Belgian eggs have recorded fipronil levels of between 0.0031 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg. Only eggs with a fipronil level of up to 0.72 mg/kg are considered safe for human consumption.\u000a\u000aBut Belgium says there is no danger. On Monday, AFSCA said test results from 21 egg-producing businesses showed a maximum level of fipronil recorded of only 0.096 mg/kg.\u000a\u000aAsked why Belgian authorities had not used the 1.2 mg/kg result, Stragier explained that figure was from the private producer and not from AFSCA\u2019s data. \u201cWe base our analysis on the results that we see in the analysis we have done here in Belgium. We\u2019ve done our own analysis and taken samples of companies which are suspected of having used fipronil, and the results indicate that there is no health risk in Belgium,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGermany also complained that the context of 1.2 mg/kg reading was not properly explained by the Belgian authorities.\u000a\u000aAndreas Tief, spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, said that when Belgium finally did inform other countries, authorities said there was no risk to other nations. They didn\u2019t tell EU countries about Poultry Vision\u2019s tainted DEGA-16 detergent.\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir message was that neighboring countries were not concerned and they did not inform us about DEGA-16,\u201d Tief said.\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater.\u000a\u000aAnd poor communication isn\u2019t helping.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe federal [agriculture] minister has not only spoken publicly about problems in the cooperation. He has also had talks on the highest levels with Belgian counterparts,\u201d Tief said. \u201cThat gives you a sense of how things are going.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater. The Hague declared eggs from 59 producers to be unfit for consumption by children.\u000a\u000aBenno Bruggink, a spokesperson for the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, said that any time fipronil levels rise above 0.72 mg/kg the authorities will issue a public warning.\u000a\u000aAsked if the approach in the Netherlands was of a more precautionary nature when compared to Belgium, he said: \u201cIt would seem so.\u201d

aV\u000a\u000aSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), pictured in May, led a letter from 18 Senate Democrats opposing President Trump\u2019s planned retirement cuts for federal employees. (Photo by Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aOpposition is growing to President Trump\u2019s plan to pick the pockets of federal employees and to his pick for the government\u2019s personnel chief.\u000a\u000aA letter from 18 Senate Democrats says his budget proposal to cut federal employee retirement benefits would \u201csignificantly harm\u201d staffers and hurt government recruitment.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe urge you to oppose any proposal that affects the ability of our federal employees to maintain their financial plans for retirement as well as their standard of living following their service to the government,\u201d said the letter to Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), the chamber\u2019s top Republican and Democrat, respectively.\u000a\u000aThe letter was organized by Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.) and includes signatures from Sens. Tim Kaine (Va.), Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernard Sanders (Vt.) among others.\u000a\u000aThey join 100 House Democrats and 10 Republicans who previously wrote separate letters opposing Trump\u2019s cuts, which include:\u000a\u000aDecreasing retirement benefits by basing them on the average of the high five years of salary instead of the current high three.\u000a\u000aEnding cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) for current and future Federal Employees Retirement System employees (FERS).\u000a\u000aShrinking the COLA for Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) employees by a half percent from what the formula otherwise allowed.\u000a\u000aStopping the supplemental retirement income for FERS employees who retire beginning in 2018.\u000a\u000aRaising employee out-of-pocket FERS payments by 1 percentage point each year until they equal the government\u2019s contribution. This would require up to six years and would result in increased payments from individuals of about 6 percent. Payments from federal law enforcement officers would similarly rise, but would not equal the greater contributions from law enforcement agencies.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Democrats placed the value of these cuts at $149 billion. A spending plan approved by the House Budget Committee would cost employees $163.5 billion over 10 years in the form of \u201cgreater contributions to their own defined benefit retirement plans.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Senate Democrats reminded McConnell and Schumer that federal staffers have already sacrificed billions in the name of deficit reduction.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince 2010, federal workers have been singled out to shoulder more than their fair share of the burden in budget negotiations,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAs the cost of living has risen and outpaced federal salary increases, our federal workers have contributed billions to deficit reduction through several years of pay freezes and increased employee retirement contributions with no additional benefits in return. On top of that, in 2013, over 750,000 federal employees were furloughed due to sequestration, costing over $1 billion in lost wages in that year alone.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnions slam Trump\u2019s pick for personnel chief\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, a broad coalition of labor organizations launched strong opposition Wednesday to Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\u000a\u000aIn a letter to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering the nomination of George Nesterczuk as Office of Personnel Management director, 16 unions said he has a failing record in fostering a federal workplace \u201cfree of discrimination, nepotism and political influence.\u201d\u000a\u000aA main point in their opposition to Nesterczuk, a former Republican OPM official, was his role in developing the Defense Department\u2019s National Security Personnel System (NSPS), which was repealed in 2009 under the weight of harsh criticism from federal unions and congressional Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Nesterczuk was one of the principal architects of NSPS, which turned out to be a discriminatory personnel system created out of extreme ideological disdain for the due process worker protections and merit system principals that define our modern day civil service,\u201d the letter said. It was organized by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and was signed by most of the major unions with federal employee members, including the AFL-CIO, an umbrella labor organization.\u000a\u000aUnion leaders are concerned that if he is confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Nesterczuk \u201cwill again attempt to do a great deal of damage to members of the federal workforce and their due process rights\u201d and continue \u201chis battle to put in place NSPS-like personnel systems throughout the federal government that would lead to even more lawsuits, waste billions more in taxpayer dollars, and result in rampant discrimination in federal workplaces across the nation.\u201d\u000a\u000aReached by phone, Nesterczuk said he did not want to get into the unions\u2019 specific allegations, but he called them \u201cfiction \u2026 made up stuff.\u201d\u000a\u000aHolman Rule hit on Congressional Budget Office fails\u000a\u000aIn other news, supporters of federal employees and honest government scored a victory Wednesday when a proposal to emasculate the Congressional Budget Office was shot down with a 309-116 bipartisan vote.\u000a\u000aUsing an obscure measure known as the Holman Rule, the provision offered by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) would have abolished the office\u2019s budget analysis division, ditching its 89 employees. This was clear retaliation against a nonpartisan agency whose research predicts tens of millions of Americans would not have health insurance under various Republican health-care proposals.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is exactly what we worried about when Republicans reinstated this arcane rule in January,\u201d said a statement from eight Democratic House members from Virginia, Maryland and the District, led by Rep. Don Beyer (Va.). \u201cThe Holman Rule empowers members of Congress to target individual federal employees. The rule is being used to punish an important advisory body for doing its job by providing forecasts which some members now find inconvenient.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe attempt failed this time, but this might not be the last time the Holman Rule appears.\u000a\u000aRead more:\u000a\u000a[Hits on federal retirement advance as bill is introduced to fire feds for \u2018no cause at all\u2019]\u000a\u000a[GOP House members hit Trump plan to break retirement promise to feds on moral, ethical grounds]\u000a\u000a[Democrats hit feds\u2019 long-term care issues and Trump\u2019s planned retirement cuts]

aVLONDON \u2014 This much is clear: If there is a Brexit deal, the U.K. is going to pay for it.\u000a\u000aReports in the British press that London\u2019s opening offer will be £36 billion (\u20ac40 billion) have focused attention on the all-important question of the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations \u2014 one of the three exit issues on which the EU wants to see \u201csufficient progress\u201d by October if Brexit talks are to move on to trade.\u000a\u000aThe specific figure of £36 billion is not recognized by Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman said Monday.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s no surprise, because while the EU wants an estimate of the bill, or at least a methodology, by October, U.K. government officials have long said they don\u2019t want to make a formal estimate until they have something to show for it. To do otherwise would be tantamount to paying tens of billions \u201cfor a conversation\u201d about trade, said one official speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is clearly prepared to pay something. The longstanding government line has been that Britain is a country that meets is legal obligations.\u000a\u000aAn opening offer of £36 billion would be well below the minimum \u20ac65 billion (£59 billion) that the EU will ask for, according to the consensus among officials in Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe debate in Whitehall is not whether the U.K. should pay, but how that payment should be managed \u2014 and how it should be presented to Euroskeptic MPs and a British public that voted for Brexit at least in part based on the false promise of £350 million a week being repatriated from the EU budget, not 100 times that amount going the other way.\u000a\u000aStaggered payment plan\u000a\u000aThe latest thinking is that part of the bill can be paid off as annual contributions to the EU budget, in exchange for market access on something close to existing terms, during a transition period.\u000a\u000aThe Telegraph, citing U.K. officials, reported that £10 billion a year net payments for three years would be proposed. Officials POLITICO spoke to said detailed proposals were not yet finalized, but the \u201cprinciples seemed sensible.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayments for three years after Brexit would end in 2021, by which time the EU\u2019s current budgetary round will have expired, and long-term planning for life without the U.K. could have taken place without any \u201ccliff edge\u201d drop in income.\u000a\u000aCharles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform think tank, said such a proposal had merit and could allow the Brexit talks to progress to the next phase.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a strong feeling among U.K. and EU officials that the best way to present the Brexit bill is as payments during a transition, in return for market access,\u201d he said. \u201cThree years of paying about £10 billion a year would mean the U.K. handing over a large part of what the EU wants \u2014 not all of it, but enough to create goodwill and probably to get the EU to talk about trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrexit Secretary David Davis, speaking back in December, pointedly declined to rule out a Brexit deal that in one shape or other saw the U.K. paying for market access.\u000a\u000aAn opening offer of £36 billion would be well below the minimum \u20ac65 billion (£59 billion) that the EU will ask for, according to the consensus among officials in Brussels.\u000a\u000aHowever, both sides\u2019 projections of the Brexit bill are in part aimed at their hard-liners.\u000a\u000aOn the British side, these are the Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs, some of whom still insist that it\u2019s the EU that should be paying Britain, not the other way round. They matter because, with the balance of power in parliament so precarious, there are enough of them to, in theory, sink the Brexit deal when it comes to a vote.\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, the hard-liners are those nation states that either receive the largest sums from the EU budget, or contribute the most. Both are determined that chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s strategy won\u2019t leave them with a shortfall.\u000a\u000aMP problem\u000a\u000aAmong Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs, the response to reports Britain is prepared to pay £36 billion were mixed.\u000a\u000aJacob Rees-Mogg, a darling of the party\u2019s traditional right wing, said it was \u201cmuch too much,\u201d warning that the U.K. should not fall into the EU \u201ctrap\u201d of conceding a bill early in negotiations. Peter Bone, one of the most hard-line Brexiteers, repeated a favorite argument that as net contributors for many years, Britain should be the one receiving a divorce bill.\u000a\u000aHowever, a more emollient tone was struck by one significant figure. Suella Fernandes chairs the European Research Group group of Brexit-backing backbench Conservative MPs. Its former chair, Steve Baker, left in June after being given a job in the Department for Exiting the European Union. The group has played a pivotal role in mediating between MPs and the government on Brexit strategy, allowing ministers to ensure they were bringing the party with them.\u000a\u000aResponding to the £36 billion reports Monday, Fernandes told POLITICO: \u201cThe U.K. has always paid its legal dues. This reported figure is however pure speculation. There\u2019s no basis for it and we don\u2019t recognize the figure. The government is focused on getting the best deal for the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, she added: \u201cAny agreement must be fair to the EU and the U.K. taxpayer. A bad deal is worse than no deal.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs recently as the spring, members of the European Research Group were arguing that May would never get a Brexit bill through parliament. After Davis\u2019 comments in December, Baker said that paying for market access would not constitute free trade. Fernandes calling for a deal that is \u201cfair\u201d to the EU represents a concession \u2014 holding out hope that May will be able to convince the group to back a Brexit bill of some form.\u000a\u000aThe Boris factor\u000a\u000aOne possible obstacle remains in the way of Tory backbenchers assenting to a Brexit bill in the tens of billions: Boris Johnson.\u000a\u000aThe foreign secretary, who was the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, was closely associated with the £350 million a week promise, so his personal reputation is bound up with the issue. Last month, he invited EU negotiators to \u201cgo whistle\u201d over their demands for a significant exit tab, positioning himself as a possible champion of those hard-liners who have yet to budge.\u000a\u000aLegally, the U.K. could leave the EU without paying a penny if there is no deal, a fact that Brexiteers such as former minister David Jones have noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis presents Boris Johnson and other hard-line ministers with a difficult dilemma: resign and perhaps fatally weaken the government; or accept a substantial budget payment and lose credibility with the Tory right-wingers,\u201d said Grant of the Centre for European Reform.\u000a\u000aJohnson\u2019s team declined to comment on Grant\u2019s suggestion that the foreign secretary might quit rather than accept a big Brexit bill \u2014 but the Brexit hard-liners, looking for a figurehead, will want a clear position from him as soon as MPs return from their summer holidays.\u000a\u000aFor some Brexiteers, however, the focus on what the U.K. owes risks the British side underestimating their negotiating hand.\u000a\u000aDavid Campbell-Bannerman, a Tory MEP and ardent Brexiteer, said: \u201cWe should be going into these negotiations like any sensible negotiator would, being confident \u2026 We have a very strong position. The EU wants access to our market \u2026 [and] to the largest financial center in the world. Let\u2019s not sell ourselves short on this.\u201d

aVFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's hire of Joel Benenson is a signal that he and his wife plan to make their philanthropy more politically focused | Drew Anderer/Getty Images Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg builds political profile, team Benenson will advise the Facebook founder\u2019s philanthropy, but the move comes amid speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama and the chief strategist to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the hire.\u000a\u000aBenenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy. The organization \u2014 whose mission statement, according to its website, is \u201cadvancing human potential and promoting equality\u201d \u2014 is endowed with the couple\u2019s Facebook fortune.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg and Chan have vowed to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares, worth an estimated $45 billion, to charity. Bringing on Benenson is the latest sign that they\u2019re pushing their philanthropic work more heavily into the political and policy world.\u000a\u000aIn January, the couple hired David Plouffe, campaign manager for Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run, as president of policy and advocacy. Plouffe had previously worked at Uber. Ken Mehlman, who ran President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign, also sits on the board.\u000a\u000aAnd earlier this year, the couple also brought on Amy Dudley, a former communications adviser to Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine.\u000a\u000aBenenson\u2019s involvement in the group gives them access to someone who was one of the top lieutenants of Clinton\u2019s doomed campaign and Obama\u2019s longtime pollster, just as speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions is mounting.\u000a\u000aBenenson did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said: \u201cAs a philanthropic organization focused on a number of substantive issues including science, education, housing, and criminal justice reform, any research efforts we undertake is to support that work.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven though he has said he has no interest in running for office, Zuckerberg\u2019s name \u2013 along with just about every other billionaire or elected official with half the name recognition of a second-tier Trump adviser \u2013 has been floated as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg, 33, stirred the speculation in June when he posted pictures of his road trip through Iowa, the first state to caucus in the primaries, as part of the tech entrepreneur\u2019s year-long project to visit every U.S. state. He has also toured a Ford assembly plant outside Detroit, a key city in the critical Rust Belt state that Clinton lost to Trump; and Dayton, Ohio, the state long considered an election bellwether.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of you have asked if this challenge means I\u2019m running for public office,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page last May. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven before his is-he-or-isn\u2019t-he road trip, Zuckerberg had shown an interest in politics and social issues. In 2010, he announced during an appearance on \u201cOprah\u201d that he was donating $100 million to help fix the Newark City public school system. The influx of Facebook cash, however, didn\u2019t generate the desired results, and the gift became a nationally-recognized failure of good intentions.\u000a\u000aBut the hiring of Benenson is sure to fuel speculation that Zuckerberg is getting more serious about how he plays in the political and policy worlds.\u000a\u000aSpeculation, however, may be the beginning and the end of the Zuckerberg for President story.\u000a\u000aThe Benenson Strategy Group does work for many non-profit groups, including AARP, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation.\u000a\u000aOn July 27, for instance, Gaga tweeted a link to a research study on youth mental wellness that she commissioned from Benenson\u2019s company. The survey, according to Gaga\u2019s Twitter post, included \u201cover 3,000 young people between the ages 15-24 and over 1,000 parents, asking questions about mental health and wellness.\u201d

aVThe definition of trust (or perhaps madness) in the EU? Letting a Brit have the keys to the headquarters of the European Commission while (almost) everyone else is on vacation.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what happened last week when Julian King \u2014 who, barring a massive Brexit change of heart, will be the last ever European commissioner from the U.K. \u2014 was on duty while his colleagues topped up their tans and caught up on summer reading. His boss, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, wasn\u2019t on holiday for all of that time \u2014 he left late last week, perhaps having given King the first shift to keep an eye on him.\u000a\u000aThe Brit, who is in charge of the security union portfolio, had some work to do. He signed off on some \u20ac9 million in new money for the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency and on a new method of financing the European Youth Orchestra, among other things.\u000a\u000aBut most importantly, he was in the office.\u000a\u000aJuncker made it clear he wants the Commission to be open for business throughout the summer in a note sent to all staff, according to people who received the memo.\u000a\u000aHe set up a summer rota of duty commissioners who must be at work. King got the first week-long shift, with Malta\u2019s Karmenu Vella taking over at the weekend, followed by Romania\u2019s Corina Cre\u0163u and then Cyprus\u2019 Christos Stylianides who\u2019ll be in charge from August 19 to 27, according to a Commission spokesperson, after which Juncker will be back.\u000a\u000aThe president gave an interview to POLITICO in a rather empty Berlaymont HQ last week, before heading to Austria on holiday.\u000a\u000aHis message then was that the Commission is ready to act \u201cwithin days\u201d if anything happens.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s become a new mantra, used when discussing retaliation against U.S. sanctions on Russia, the legality of Venezuela\u2019s recent election or Poland wielding the ax both against protected trees and the rule of law.\u000a\u000aThe summer rota is part of Juncker\u2019s ambition of leading a \u201cpolitical Commission\u201d and a way of showing other EU institutions, national capitals and even the citizens of Europe, that politics can\u2019t always wait until September.\u000a\u000aParliament\u2019s long pause\u000a\u000aThe European Parliament hasn\u2019t taken the same approach, with President Antonio Tajani sending a letter to Juncker and other EU leaders telling them not to bother getting in touch.\u000a\u000aTajani told \u201cDear Jean-Claude\u201d that the Parliament was taking its summer break and no work should be sent over before early September.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would be grateful if you could suspend, from the date of reception of this letter, the transmission of any notification or request to the budgetary authority [that\u2019s the Parliament],\u201d Tajani wrote in a letter dated July 13 \u2014 although he is keeping himself busy and did pop up last Tuesday, sending angry letters about Venezuela, which POLITICO obtained, to the Council and Commission.\u000a\u000aAccording to EU diplomats, efforts to coordinate the bloc\u2019s position on Venezuela were already underway by Tuesday, and the message was delivered Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe home-alone commissioner isn\u2019t completely on their own. At 9:45 a.m. every weekday, a skeleton staff meets in the Berlaymont, according to participants. Among them are officials from the Cabinets of both the president and that week\u2019s duty commissioner, as well as from the secretariat-general and the spokespersons\u2019 service.\u000a\u000aAt 10:30 a.m. all last week, a smaller group of people more or less directly reporting to Juncker met with the president to discuss the important matters of the day. They were given Juncker\u2019s cell phone number for while he\u2019s away.\u000a\u000aThe College of Commissioners reconvenes at the end of August for a retreat, which could easily be turned into a \u201cfully-fledged\u201d meeting should the need arise, a senior Commission official said.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s midday press briefing also carries on throughout the summer, although it\u2019s been downgraded to a much smaller room.\u000a\u000aTo calm Italy\u2019s fears on migration, Juncker has set up a special telephone hotline and email address that alerts three senior Commission officials, \u201cto ensure a constant chain of communication between Italy and the European Commission,\u201d Juncker wrote to Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in July.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s midday press briefing also carries on throughout the summer, although it\u2019s been downgraded to a much smaller room.\u000a\u000aOf course, some people can\u2019t completely disconnect even when they are supposed to be on holiday. Commissioner V\u011bra Jourová, who oversees consumer protection, has been tweeting away to make sure EU citizens are aware of what the Commission does for them.\u000a\u000a\u201cSummer is coming, and the EU is always on your side,\u201d she said in a video, whether it\u2019s about a late flight (you\u2019ve got rights), a lost passport or diplomatic incident (\u201cyou have the right to consular protection\u201d) or suntan lotion (\u201csafe\u201d if sold on EU soil).\u000a\u000aThe Czech commissioner spoke in English, perhaps to make sure the Brits realize what they\u2019re leaving behind.

Ltd.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThis bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThe United States will not stand for such action. This will require U.S. banks to ensure that the Bank of Dandong does not access the U.S. financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks.\u201d\u000a\u000aMnuchin refused to detail the connection between the Chinese bank and the North Korean government, nor would he say whether or not the Chinese government had been given advance warning of the sanctions. But he took care to note that the sanctions were not directed specifically at the Chinese government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile today's actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAmid a period of ramped-up missile testing and bellicose rhetoric from North Korea last spring, President Donald Trump said he would pursue cooperation from the Chinese government in corralling its southern neighbor. China has long been the North Korean regime\u2019s chief international patron and by far its most lucrative trading partner, and Trump publicly committed to seeking China\u2019s assistance in pressuring North Korea into ending its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

aVMedia bashing has become one of the organizing principles of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. But behind the scenes, the Trump machine is eagerly promoting the nuggets of positive press it receives from the very outlets the president seeks to discredit.\u000a\u000aThe White House director of rapid response, Andy Hemming, 31, spends his days immersed in cable television, Twitter, print and online media to suss out positive stories about Trump, which he blasts back out to his list of more than 1,000 influencers \u2014 mainly reporters, but also television talking heads \u2014 who together craft the overall story of Trump\u2019s presidency.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s nothing new about an administration trying to promote its wins. But in the Trump White House, where Hemming\u2019s job is not to discredit the mainstream media but to celebrate stories the administration likes, it can seem like he is trying to bail out a sinking boat with a teacup.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s a role that feels out of sync with Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the press. Trump spent the first day of his summer break Monday tweetstorming about the country's major cable networks and newspapers. \u201cHard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is installed on his golf course for a two-week vacation.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aHe followed up later on a wet, unconducive-to-golfing afternoon, with a honed Twitter attack launched at his favorite target: \u201cHow much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?\u201d\u000a\u000aA New York Times spokesperson said the business is actually growing in profit, income, revenues and paid subscriptions.\u000a\u000aIn July, Trump posted a video of himself wrestling to the ground a man with a CNN logo obscuring his face \u2014 a post that has since been retweeted more than 370,000 times. But Hemming that same month highlighted clips from the network, including one of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein telling anchor Wolf Blitzer she saw no evidence of collusion between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t always get it wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of mainstream news outlets like The New York Times and CNN. \u201cBut for every one good story we push out, there are probably 150 really bad process stories, or hit pieces, on the administration. We think a lot of times, the stories that we push out have been given very little coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn July 18, for instance, while Trump tweeted about the \u201cFake News story of secret dinner with Putin\u201d \u2014 he called the story \u201csick\u201d \u2014 Hemming was highlighting a story from the allegedly ailing Grey Lady.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe New York Times\u2019 Carl Hulse has a solid explainer on the Senate Democrats\u2019 unprecedented effort to block President Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d Hemming wrote, with a link to the story. Earlier in July, Hemming emailed out a New York Times piece that he called \u201ca good article on how small businesses across the country are cheering President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an important role,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign spokesman who worked closely with Hemming from the 2016 war room in Trump Tower. \u201cThere\u2019s so much good news that\u2019s coming out of this administration, that we have to continue pushing all of these positive messages ourselves to remind people there\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d (Miller is now a paid contributor on CNN.)\u000a\u000aHemming, who is paid $89,000 a year, is a career Republican campaign operative who until he entered Trump\u2019s orbit had worked for establishment GOP figures like Meg Whitman, during her failed run for governor in California; Mitt Romney, during his unsuccessful 2012 bid for president; and Greg Abbott, during his successful run for Texas governor. Last year, he worked for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s campaign before going to the Republican National Committee and being embedded in Trump Tower for the final 100 days of the general election.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s always been a behind-the-scenes operative, associates said, but for the first few weeks of the administration, Hemming was toiling, perhaps for the first time in his life, in total obscurity. Hemming would blast out his carefully curated clips, sometimes multiple times a day, with the goal of driving more positive news coverage.\u000a\u000aBut for weeks, sources inside the White House said, no one informed him that the White House IT system could not handle an email going out to such a big list, and all of his emails were being blocked by a firewall and reaching an audience of zero readers. That glitch has since been corrected, and the administration thinks Hemming is helping to slowly change the course of the coverage it gets.\u000a\u000a\u201cAndy does an incredible job of finding those hidden gems and trying to amplify those positive messages,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s quick, and I would say he has a very good pulse on what\u2019s hot, but also on what wasn\u2019t hot but should be.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe declined to comment for this story.\u000a\u000aThe fact-checker column in the newspaper Trump now refers to disparagingly as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d has been highlighted by Hemming and the rapid response team on multiple occasions, for example, for knocking down misleading statements about Trump\u2019s policies made by lawmakers like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kamala Harris, also a California Democrat.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat makes it so audacious and confusing is that no president has been so outspoken \u2014 and outrageous \u2014 about impeaching mainstream news outlets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, who is also a paid CNN analyst. \u201cIf these outlets are \u2018fake,\u2019 then why should we believe that their positive reporting about the president and the administration is real? It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment that, despite the president\u2019s calculated and persistent assaults, these news sources are very credible.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso undercutting Trump\u2019s constant assaults, Axelrod noted, is how Trump frequently participates in interviews with reporters representing the very news organization he rails against.\u000a\u000aOthers warned that to take Trump literally is to misunderstand the president. \u201cUnderstanding Trump means you have to have a healthy dose of humor and skepticism about the spoken word,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aOf the White House\u2019s efforts to promote stories from the same organizations the president discredits, Fleischer pointed to a moment last March, when former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the monthly jobs numbers produced by the labor department that Trump had previously discredited \u201cmay have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you square it?\u201d asked Fleischer. \u201cYou square it with a smile.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBritish Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis and European Union Chief Negotiator in charge of Brexit Michel Barnier | Thierry Charlier/AFP via Getty Images Both sides want to speed up Brexit talks by meeting more frequently There are fears that there will not be \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 on exit issues by the EU\u2019s October deadline.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. and EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiators David Davis and Michel Barnier both want to quicken the pace of Brexit negotiations by holding more frequent talks over the summer and fall, according to individuals familiar with the position in both camps.\u000a\u000aBarnier, the European Commission\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told a meeting of Brussels diplomats Wednesday that the chances of the talks progressing to the next stage by October were diminishing and that negotiations would have to \u201cintensify\u201d if enough progress is to be made, according to an EU diplomat present at the meeting. But he said the EU side would only be prepared to speed up if the U.K. brought substantial proposals on its financial settlement with the bloc.\u000a\u000a\u201cBarnier told us that he would be ready to organize a meeting on August 15th if it was necessary [two weeks earlier than currently planned],\u201d another EU ambassador said. \u201cIt all depends on how prepared the U.K side is.\u201d The ambassador said he doubted the talks would have progressed enough before October for them to move onto issues around the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\u000a\u000aThe British are also pushing for an acceleration of the negotiations. According to an individual with high-level knowledge of the talks, U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis has already told Barnier that the two sides should be meeting more frequently than the scheduled monthly talks, held within four-week cycles.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe British have been telling the EU side that one meeting a month is not enough,\u201d the individual said. \u201cDavid Davis has consistently told Barnier that we should be meeting more frequently.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe moves to push the talks forward more quickly reflect rising anxiety at the highest levels on both sides over the shrinking window to get a deal by March 2019 and also the lack of a clear path forward on many issues.\u000a\u000aThe EU side\u2019s disappointment with the limited progress made in last week\u2019s first full round of talks has heightened the sense of urgency in Brussels. Barnier intends to report back to the European Council on the progress of Brexit talks in October. The Council will then take a decision, at their summit on October 19 and 20, on whether \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made to allow the talks to develop from focusing solely on exit issues like the U.K.\u2019s so-called Brexit bill to future relationship issues like trade and customs arrangements.\u000a\u000aThe EU diplomat, who participated in Barnier\u2019s briefing to Brussels diplomats on Wednesday, said: \u201cBarnier told diplomats that if we want to move on, we will have to intensify the pace of negotiations.\u201d The diplomat added that for talks to speed up, the British side would have to present a clearer position on a range of issues. EU negotiators were disappointed last week that the U.K. had made no proposal of a sum, or a methodology for reaching a sum, of the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the EU on Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Brits must show up with a clear plan,\u201d if they wanted to speed up the talks process, the diplomat added.\u000a\u000aAt the briefing, Barnier said that if there was no progress on the Brexit bill by October he would inform the Council and that it would be \u201cout of question to talk about any future relationship,\u201d the diplomat added. Barnier told the group twice that the British did not \u201cseem to bear the consequences of their choice\u201d to leave the EU, the diplomat said.\u000a\u000aA U.K. government official said Davis \u201chas always been clear that we are committed to working hard and at pace and constructively to advance these talks as swiftly as possible \u2026 We will continue to be extremely well prepared for each round of talks.\u201d\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the U.K.\u2019s Department for Exiting the EU said: \u201cNegotiations to leave the EU are underway and we have already made good progress on a number of issues. As the secretary of state said, it is important that both sides demonstrate a dynamic and flexible approach to these negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGovernment officials are working at pace and we are confident we will have made sufficient progress by October to advance the talks to the next phase. On the financial settlement, we have been clear that we recognize the U.K. has obligations to the EU and that the EU also has obligations to the U.K.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 Britain is about to show its hand in Brexit negotiations in plans that reveal the U.K. wants a smooth route out of the European Union.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. will seek a transitional customs agreement with the EU before moving to a new permanent relationship under plans sent to relevant members of Theresa May\u2019s Cabinet for agreement before being published later this month, according to senior government officials.\u000a\u000aThe proposal \u2014 if it is agreed politically \u2014 will be set out in an official \u201cposition paper\u201d that has been penciled in for publication the week of August 14, an official familiar with the content of the paper said. A second position paper, outlining the government\u2019s long-awaited \u201csolution\u201d to the Northern Ireland border issue, which the U.K. considers bound up with its customs relationship with the EU, has been earmarked for publication the same week, officials said.\u000a\u000aThe position papers will form part of what officials described as a \u201cbig push\u201d to counter a perception among the EU27 that the U.K. is underprepared for Brexit. They are the first of up to a dozen U.K. position papers to be published by the government over the next two months, ahead of the crucial October European Council summit, as set out to POLITICO in conversations with five senior U.K. government officials involved in the preparations for Brexit.\u000a\u000aThe plans show the British government wants a smooth exit from the EU that preserves trading relations in a nod to Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s vision of a more gradual divergence from Brussels as opposed to the hard break preferred by more hard-line cabinet ministers such as Trade Secretary Liam Fox. It is not yet clear whether the proposed transitional arrangement would allow the U.K. to strike trade deals with third countries outside the EU.\u000a\u000aThe bulk of the work on the position papers was completed some time ago, but in recent weeks there has been a discernible \u201cpickup of the pace,\u201d one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a cranking up of the machine into another gear. There is an awareness that we have to get to the European Council having shown seriousness,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s performance during the first substantive round of talks last month was criticized in Brussels and in the British press for appearing slapdash, an impression encapsulated by a photo of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his team seated at the negotiating table without notes, while EU negotiators arrived with reams of papers. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, was particularly frustrated by the U.K.\u2019s refusal to put forward a counter-proposal setting out the cost of divorce.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. will make a concerted effort in the next round of talks later this month to agree on a final package on the rights of EU citizens who want to stay in the U.K. and British citizens living elsewhere in the EU, an issue that is also among the EU27\u2019s top 3 priorities. \u201cWe want to put it to bed as soon as possible,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe will exert some pressure to get that one over the line at the next round.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe plans make clear the U.K.\u2019s priorities for the next rounds of talks. They suggest the two sides are aligned on the importance of citizens\u2019 rights and the need for agreement on the Irish border. The EU has insisted \u201csufficient progress\u201d must be made on its top 3 priorities \u2014 citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s financial obligations to the EU and the Irish border \u2014 before talks can consider future relations between Britain and the rest of the bloc.\u000a\u000aBut while the EU is likely to welcome the emerging clarity in London\u2019s position, senior U.K. aides said the government remains determined to hold back on resolving how much the U.K. must pay to settle what the EU sees as its financial liabilities, a move that is likely to infuriate Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is also insistent that the Irish border question must be considered alongside future customs arrangements, something the EU wants to delay until its first three priorities are resolved.\u000a\u000aCustoms arrangements \u2018critical\u2019\u000a\u000aWhile Britain\u2019s future customs agreement with the EU is not on the agenda for this month\u2019s Brexit talks, the U.K. believes the issue is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the Northern Ireland question, which Brussels has demanded progress on. By publishing the two documents together before the talks in Brussels, London hopes to persuade Barnier that the two cannot be dealt with separately.\u000a\u000aUnder the original plan drawn up in Whitehall, with input from No. 10 Downing Street, the position papers were set to be published in two tranches \u2014 one before the August talks in Brussels and the second before the next round in September.\u000a\u000aHowever, the publication dates are now in flux, according to aides familiar with the discussions. Officials have even discussed publishing them all simultaneously this month in a show of force to counter accusations that the British government does not have a plan.\u000a\u000aThe customs paper is regarded by the U.K.\u2019s Brexit team as being of \u201ccritical importance,\u201d according to one senior government official involved in the planning process who asked to remain anonymous.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe one we\u2019re looking at most intently is customs,\u201d the official said. There has been input from HMRC \u2014 the department responsible for tax collection \u2014 from the Treasury and from leaders in Northern Ireland, the official added. \u201cThat\u2019s the paper that\u2019s most critical,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe customs position paper will substantially clarify the government\u2019s proposals on an issue that had been left wide open.\u000a\u000aIn her Lancaster House speech in January, May set out a range of options: a completely new customs arrangement; associate membership of the existing customs union; or the U.K. signing up to \u201csome elements\u201d of the customs union and not others.\u000a\u000aHowever, she also ruled out remaining part of the EU\u2019s common commercial policy and common external tariff \u2014 elements of the customs union that, she said, prevent the U.K. striking its own free-trade agreements with other countries.\u000a\u000aA key question for Cabinet to decide will be whether the U.K.\u2019s proposals reconcile May\u2019s wish for \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade with the EU and avoiding arduous customs checks, with the need to liberate Britain from measures that would restrict future bilateral trade talks, either during any transition period or afterward.\u000a\u000aThe position paper dedicated to Northern Ireland will set out the U.K.\u2019s long-awaited proposals for avoiding a \u201chard border\u201d with the Republic of Ireland.\u000a\u000aFox has indicated he would not support a transition arrangement that prevented him making trade deals. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show in July that such a settlement would disadvantage the U.K. if Britain \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to take full advantage of the freedoms available to us when we leave the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome of his Cabinet colleagues \u2014 most notably Hammond \u2014 have indicated they favor a longer transition. In a speech in June, the chancellor told finance and business leaders in the City of London that Britain will \u201calmost certainly need an implementation period, outside the customs union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running.\u201d He added that such frictionless customs arrangements were needed to keep the Irish land border \u201cfree-flowing.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorthern Ireland proposal\u000a\u000aBoth sides agree Northern Ireland is a priority, though neither has yet put forward a proposal to manage the land border without destabilizing peace in the region once the U.K. leaves the bloc.\u000a\u000aLondon hopes its position paper will break the deadlock on the issue, which is being managed directly by Britain\u2019s leading Brexit official Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union and May\u2019s EU sherpa, and by Barnier\u2019s deputy Sabine Weyand.\u000a\u000aNorthern Ireland is viewed by the EU27 as an exit issue \u2014 and therefore a priority for the initial phases of Brexit talks \u2014 but Britain believes a resolution depends heavily upon issues that the EU considers to be part of the future relationship bucket of issues, namely customs and transition.\u000a\u000aThe position paper dedicated to Northern Ireland will set out the U.K.\u2019s long-awaited proposals for avoiding a \u201chard border\u201d with the Republic of Ireland. While officials declined to share details of the plan, the U.K. government has been considering technical fixes \u2014 such as camera recognition technology and pre-registered cargo \u2014 to minimize the need for physical border check points.\u000a\u000aLondon is not convinced by arguments, made recently by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, that the matter cannot be resolved by such \u201ctechnical solutions.\u201d One of the U.K. officials said Coveney\u2019s comments, to RTÉ in July, had been \u201cpremature.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe British have been \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the more assertive tone of the new Irish administration, under Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the official added. On Friday, Varadkar called on the U.K., if it must leave the EU customs union, to join a new bilateral customs union with the EU similar to Turkey\u2019s.\u000a\u000aWith talks due to resume in the last week of August, both sides in the negotiation will soon find out exactly how far they are apart on key issues.

aVAfter a decade-long run of bad weather that included Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Ike, and a host of other river valley and storm-surge floods, the 45-year-old National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) owes taxpayers about $25 billion that no analyst believes it will ever pay back. Meanwhile, by keeping rates far lower than the private market ever would for some flood-prone properties, the program encourages development in ways that endanger lives and harm the environment.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why it\u2019s disturbing that so many in Congress\u2014including some who stand firm against government meddling in other areas of the economy\u2014have embarked on an effort to undo modest reforms that actually move the program in the right direction. Whether Congress can stay the course on flood-insurance reform is a clear test of its willingness to put its fiscal house in order and govern in the public interest.\u000a\u000aThe reforms in question were enacted last year in the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act, one of the few major pieces of legislation to pass a terribly riven Congress in 2012. At a glance, they seem to offer something for everyone. Environmentalists got better maps of flood zones that reflect rising sea levels, as well as improved protection of nature. Fiscal hawks saw premium subsidies phased out for owners of second homes, business properties, and houses the taxpayers had already rebuilt multiple times, as well as a transition to appropriate rates for people who have been remapped into higher-risk areas.\u000a\u000aPrivate property insurers continue to get payments for servicing policies under the NFIP\u2019s \u201cwrite your own\u201d program. The law also opened the door to privatizing at least part of the NFIP via private reinsurance and catastrophe bonds.\u000a\u000aRealtors, local governments, and developers, who would have preferred the status quo, at least got assurance that the program would continue into the future and that rates wouldn\u2019t rise sharply for most primary residences. More than 90 percent of the program\u2019s 5.5 million policies would see no major changes in rates.\u000a\u000aThe only real losers\u2014people who will no longer get subsidies\u2014are literally members of the \u201c1 percent.\u201d There are 130 million housing units in the country, 1.1 million of which receive subsidized flood insurance through NFIP. And of those 1.1 million, nearly 80 percent are found in counties that rank in the wealthiest quintile. And most of them won\u2019t see their premiums rise sharply anyway.\u000a\u000aBut the reforms\u2019 vast benefits and modest costs may not suffice. A little more than a year after passage, many who once signed off on the reforms have changed their minds. In local briefings around the country, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the NFIP, set off a panic by offering accounts of rates rocketing up to $20,000 and $30,000 per year. When about 350,000 second-homeowners (by definition, not poor) got much higher bills this past January, opposition to the reforms kicked into high gear. The National Association of Realtors, arguably the most powerful trade association in Washington, joined with developers and local governments to call for vast changes and convened a high-level committee to seek measures that would effectively gut the core provisions of Biggert-Waters.\u000a\u000aCongress responded. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who coauthored the reform legislation, did a U-turn, and in June the House passed an amendment to a Homeland Security appropriations bill that suspended the core flood-insurance provisions for a year. Meanwhile, 23 senators have jumped on to a bill sponsored by senators Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) that would delay all rate changes for four years, effectively punting the issue until the NFIP\u2019s next scheduled reauthorization, at which point it\u2019s not inconceivable that the program\u2019s debt to taxpayers could rise as high as $50 billion. While plenty of liberals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have joined the bill, so have conservatives like Sen. David Vitter (R-La.).\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t to say that the reforms have no flaws or couldn\u2019t use some changes. A handful of people of modest means who are unexpectedly remapped into much higher risk areas may be socked with larger bills they can\u2019t afford to pay and should probably get some temporary relief as long as they occupy their homes. More seriously, a longstanding rate-setting practice of ignoring levees that don\u2019t provide protection against 100-year floods has resulted in some people behind \u201cdecertified\u201d or \u201cuncertified\u201d levees being charged much higher rates than they should be. (Developers and others blocked an effort to fix this, because it would have also required more of those behind the levees to purchase coverage.) Other broader changes\u2014even rate freezes for people of modest means who own their own homes\u2014probably should be part of a negotiation.\u000a\u000aBut not every problem has a government solution. Even the truly high rates\u2014which will likely be in the neighborhood of $10,000 rather than the $30,000 figures FEMA has thrown around\u2014may be more an opportunity than anything else. They can be a catalyst for serious discussions about mitigation or buyouts for those who face the enormous risks that justify extremely high rates. Moreover, as higher rates have rolled out, at least a half-dozen companies around the country have announced plans to go into business in competition with the government\u2019s program. While they won\u2019t charge subsidized rates, many of them may be able to underprice the government on unsubsidized coverage.\u000a\u000aOn balance, the reforms under Biggert-Waters are incredibly modest: More than half of the properties most at risk won\u2019t see rate increases even if all of the reforms go into force. The private sector\u2019s role in flood insurance for homeowners will grow only slightly. Anyone looking to privatize flood coverage in a serious way will have to make further reforms when Biggert-Waters expires in 2017.\u000a\u000aStill, each year that subsidies for development in flood-prone areas continue, more people will move into harm\u2019s way. As the backlash to the reforms demonstrates, once they are there, it is beyond difficult to get them out.\u000a\u000aThis has very real human costs: Undoing a modest phaseout of flood insurance subsidies almost surely would mean plucking more people off of roofs with helicopters during the next massive flood or seeing more of them perish. And things appear certain to get worse. Ocean levels have been rising for at least 10,000 years, and climate change may accelerate this process in the future.\u000a\u000aThe real problem, however, isn\u2019t the flood insurance program itself, but rather what it represents. In the context of a $3.5 trillion budget, the NFIP\u2019s $25 billion of unpayable debt isn\u2019t a fiscal calamity. But Congress\u2019s seeming inability to stick with modest reforms\u2014even when they produce far more winners than losers\u2014proves how hard it is for the federal government to do anything that improves the nation\u2019s finances. If members of Congress can\u2019t save flood insurance reform, it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019ll ever be able to fix far larger fiscal ills.\u000a\u000aEli Lehrer is president of the R Street Institute.

aVPARIS \u2014 Here\u2019s a message from the City of Light: Don\u2019t believe the hype about Frankfurt sweeping up all of Brexit\u2019s finance jobs.\u000a\u000aWith 20 banks already signed up to move staff to Frankfurt, the city is widely considered way ahead of Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin and other cities vying to attract the finance sector that will be leaving London due to Brexit.\u000a\u000aLobbyists for the glass-and-steel German city point to the presence of the German and European central banks, an English-speaking regulator and almost a dozen new high-rise buildings as big draws for finance firms seeking a foothold on the Continent.\u000a\u000aWhile the case looks strong, Paris boosters argue that it has also got plenty of holes. Most banks that have promised to move to Frankfurt, they point out, only talk of establishing legal headquarters there, which can be accomplished with minimum staff. That\u2019s not the same as shifting an entire trading room.\u000a\u000aMajor post-Brexit decisions on moving operations are still to come, with estimates of how many jobs will be affected ranging from 30,000 to 230,000 depending on the outcome of negotiations between the U.K. and EU. When banks do shift greater resources, particularly for their trading operations, Paris advocates argue they will pay attention to surrounding financial conditions \u2014 and balk at concerns about the German banking sector.\u000a\u000aThen there is the relative size and prestige of Paris versus Frankfurt. The former has a population of 10 million and the economy of a global metropolis on par with London and New York, while the latter is an up-and-coming seat for central banks with a population of 730,000.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re getting a rather distorted image of Frankfurt as the hands-down winner of this race for Brexit jobs\u201d \u2014 Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace\u000a\u000aGermany may have more attractive tax and labor conditions, but France\u2019s new president, Emmanuel Macron, is charging ahead with plans to make France competitive. He plans to scrap the highest bracket of payroll tax for banks and other firms that don\u2019t pay VAT and to cancel a planned extension of tax on share trading. Macron has also pledged to make sure bonuses are not taken into account when labor courts decide on unfair dismissal compensation.\u000a\u000aThe rub: Don\u2019t count Paris out.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re getting a rather distorted image of Frankfurt as the hands-down winner of this race for Brexit jobs,\u201d said Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace, an organization that promotes the city as a financial center.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut when we start talking about relocating entire trading teams, about big-time staffing decisions, Paris is still very much a contender \u2026 We\u2019re convinced that in the short to medium term, Paris\u2019 advantages will start to shine through in a compelling way, especially compared to Frankfurt,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFrankfurt\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel\u000a\u000aFrankfurt\u2019s strengths on paper have allowed the German city to pull ahead of its French rival in winning commitments to move there from big banks. Its official bid to host the European Banking Authority \u2014 the EU\u2019s banking regulator \u2014 submitted Monday placed great emphasis on the city\u2019s dominance in financial market supervision as well as its growing clientele of banks.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to customer business, Frankfurt is where the clients are,\u201d Michael Horn, a spokesperson for the Hessian minister for European and federal affairs, said in July.\u000a\u000aU.S. bank Citigroup, Britain\u2019s Standard Chartered and Japan\u2019s Nomura are among those that have decided to make Frankfurt their legal base.\u000a\u000aBut Bresson says the devil is in the word \u201clegal.\u201d Many such decisions, he said, may boil down to opening a beachhead office with a handful of staffers in order to have a presence on the Continent, not a bona fide trading hub.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere your legal entity is based is not where your people are based,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in July at a conference in Paris. \u201cThe people could be in Paris, in the Netherlands, or Madrid or anywhere in the EU. We haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong banks committed to Frankfurt, Citibank is relocating an estimated 200 staff. By contrast, HSBC said in January it would move 1,000 trading staff to Paris. Added to commitments to repatriate staff from a slew of French banks including Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, Paris appears only slightly behind Frankfurt on Brexit job moves already announced: The former has clocked 2,500 to the latter\u2019s 2,800, according to calculations by Paris Europlace.\u000a\u000aAnother 30 financial institutions, including large Asian and U.S. banks, are in talks with French regulators about moving to Paris, according to Europlace.\u000a\u000aOverall, the Bruegel think tank estimates some 30,000 jobs could move to the Continent from the City of London if Brexit becomes a reality, while others put the figure much higher. That means that the process is only beginning. When big decisions come, banks will look at a range of factors, notably the health of a country\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aHere, France has the upper hand, Bresson said. \u201cCommerzbank is in a delicate situation, Deutsche Bank has difficulties internationally, and then there are the Landesbanks, which also have issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows there are difficulties within the system, which could create problems down the line for interbank lending for financial firms.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrench banks, four of which are in the European top 10 for size, are not a persistent worry for regulators. Intensive trading activities mean there is deep expertise among regulators. And contrary to some claims from rivals, they are briefing potential clients in English.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe big difference between Paris and Frankfurt in regulation is that Paris has greater expertise in terms of market activity than the German authority,\u201d Bresson said.\u000a\u000aFrance changing\u000a\u000aFor now, Germany has a lower corporate tax rate than France (29.7 percent versus 33.3 percent). But the French rate is set to fall to 28 percent by 2020. On July 7, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe rolled out a series of other measures aimed at Brexiting banks, including scrapping the top bracket of payroll tax for financial sectors workers.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly Paris and its La Défense neighborhood can propose a viable alternative to companies installed in London\u201d \u2014 Marie Celie Guillaume, chief of Defacto\u000a\u000aRigid labor rules have long been a concern for foreign banks considering doing business in France, an issue HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, underscored in July. Planned reforms were \u201cvery positive\u201d but banks wanted to see whether Macron would be able to carry out his agenda and whether he will be able to defend it during a second term, Gulliver said.\u000a\u000aYet Macron is charging ahead with changes to the labor code, with a series of executive decrees due to be published no later than the end of September, according to Philippe. The president, a former Rothschild banker himself, is bent on making France a winner from Brexit and is throwing his weight behind efforts to draw bankers to Paris.\u000a\u000aOne of the main draws of Paris is that it is a more attractive place to live, with a culinary and cultural scene to rival London\u2019s and satisfy large-walleted finance employees. The city also has plenty of space to welcome an influx of bankers, with seven new skyscrapers due to be built in the La Défense Business district by 2021, amounting to 375,000 square meters of new office space.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly Paris and its La Défense neighborhood can propose a viable alternative to companies installed in London, either in terms of economic environment or lifestyle for the workers,\u201d said Marie Celie Guillaume, chief of Defacto, the company that promotes La Défense.

aVRussia won in Syria thanks to President Barack Obama\u2019s inaction. The Middle East unraveling of the past decade is due in no small part to America not listening to her allies in the region. Never mind President Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim-bashing rhetoric, he may just be a better partner.\u000a\u000aFor months, leaders of America's Arab allies in the Mideast have telegraphed this view of the world, and it helps explain why the gilded palaces of the troubled, war-torn region are the few places on the planet \u2014 outside Russia \u2014 where Trump has been more popular than the president he succeeded.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThis is the case Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri laid out in an exclusive interview for The Global Politico at the end of a weeklong visit to Washington. The tone was measured, but taken together his comments amount to a striking and stark indictment of Obama and much recent U.S. policy in the Middle East. \u201cThe unfortunate consequence of not acting\u201d there, Hariri argues, has been Russia\u2019s restoration as a regional heavyweight, the resurrection of Bashar Assad\u2019s bloody regime in Syria and the failure to produce an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cClarity,\u201d the prime minister says, and the hope for a more decisive approach is the reason why he and other Arab leaders prefer Trump, despite the bombast and uncertainty the first six months of his presidency have unleashed. Unstated, but by all accounts just as significant, is the expectation that Trump will take a more hawkish approach toward Syria\u2019s backers in Iran, and Hariri repeatedly brought up concessions Obama made toward Tehran to get his nuclear deal as an example of how the U.S. lost its way in the region.\u000a\u000aGiven the bloody six-year war in next-door Syria that has come close to overwhelming tiny Lebanon, sending a flood of 1.5 million refugees into a fragile nation of just 4.5 million people and putting the terrorist group ISIS right on their border, it\u2019s a case worth listening to \u2014 even if you think it absolves the Arab world of accountability for its own actions.\u000a\u000aMuch of Hariri\u2019s critique of Obama comes down to naivete \u2014 and the big gap between America\u2019s inspirational rhetoric and its actions.\u000a\u000aThe Global Politico Susan B. Glasser\u2019s new weekly podcast takes you backstage in a world disrupted. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aOn Syria, for example, Hariri says that Obama was just taken in by Assad and the Russians when he made a deal with them in 2013 to remove chemical weapons \u2014 and that Obama should have bombed Assad when the Syrian dictator crossed his \u201cred line\u201d by gassing his own people.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know their actions. We know their lies. We know what they do to people. We know how they act with people. So, when Bashar al-Assad says that, you know, he\u2019s going to get rid of the chemical weapons, he\u2019s not,\u201d Hariri says. \u201cAnd if you believe him, it\u2019s your mistake that you\u2019re believing him. And that\u2019s why when the red line was drawn, you could have come to the same deal after your actions. But that message would have, you know, gone down way better in the region and the regime would have understood that America meant business.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, he argues Trump has no choice but to deal with Moscow. \u201cThe main power today in Syria is Russia, so if you want to solve the issue of Syria, you\u2019ve got to talk to the Russians,\u201d Hariri says. \u201cThat was the unfortunate consequence of not acting. And now, since they are there, somebody has to talk to them.\u201d\u000a\u000aHariri also faults Obama for the big gap between the \u201cinspirational\u201d words in his 2009 Cairo speech suggesting a new American approach to the region \u2014 and the \u201cnothing\u201d that came of Obama\u2019s efforts to forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians. And he points out that while Arab leaders opposed President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq, they were also strongly against the 2011 American pullout of Iraq during Obama\u2019s presidency, a withdrawal that many in the region believe left a dangerous vacuum eventually filled by the rise of the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the war started in Iraq,\u201d Hariri tells me, \u201call your allies in the region told you not to go there. And when you withdrew, all your allies in the region told you not to withdraw. And all your allies in the region told you to do something about Syria, but you didn\u2019t. So, I believe that talking to your allies, listening to your allies, they\u2019re there. They know better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIt is, of course, far easier to criticize the United States for its blundering about the Middle East than it is to explain the fiendishly complicated politics of Lebanon today, a generation after a civil war so devastating it killed nearly a quarter-million people and came to define the bloody extremes of sectarian conflict.\u000a\u000aTake Hariri\u2019s own situation. At age 47, he is an accidental prime minister, a politician who never expected to be one as a direct result of the assassination of his father, Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, by a massive car bomb in Beirut 12 years ago. The case is still being investigated by an international tribunal, but the killers are widely believed to have been connected with the Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah and its ally the Assad regime in Syria, as Hariri reminds me in the course of our conversation.\u000a\u000aWhich makes it all the more incredible that Hariri, a Sunni with strong ties to the Saudi royal family, is today prime minister of a government in Lebanon that includes Hezbollah \u2014 a ruling coalition that was put together in December 2016 after three years of gridlock, with the Hezbollah-linked Christian leader Michael Aoun as president and Hariri as prime minister. Hezbollah is easily the strongest armed force in Lebanon, and no deal was possible without it, but it means Hariri must perform an agonizingly complicated political dance every day \u2014 or risk his government falling apart.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked a few smart Mideast political hands what I should ask Hariri before our interview, one responded, \u201cHezbollah, Hezbollah, Hezbollah,\u201d although another pointed out that Hariri could hardly be frank on the subject. \u201cHe cannot say what he thinks about Hezbollah; otherwise there will be no government,\u201d this expert said. \u201cHe is a hostage; the whole country is a hostage.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe awkward dance was on full display during Hariri\u2019s Rose Garden news conference with Trump on Tuesday. Though the headlines were about Trump\u2019s scathing criticism of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, Mideast hands were quick to pick up on an apparent Trump gaffe when the president bragged about Lebanon being \u201con the front lines\u201d fighting Hezbollah \u2014 and seemed not to know that Hezbollah was in fact a part of the government of the man standing next to him.\u000a\u000aIt was a tough trap for Hariri: Acknowledge the screw-up and he\u2019d offend Trump at a moment when the U.S. administration has threatened to cut desperately needed foreign aid or agree with the American president on the need to fight Hezbollah and risk blowing up his own government.\u000a\u000aIn the end, Hariri handled it deftly, brushing off Trump\u2019s mistake and later telling reporters that he was sure from their private meeting that the president had understood the situation correctly. Hariri left Washington not only with his foreign aid intact but a State Department pledge for an additional $140 million to help with Syrian refugees.\u000a\u000aIn our interview, Hariri remained resolutely pragmatic whenever the subject of Hezbollah came up. He\u2019s very clear that the choice was, in effect, to team up with the group tied to his father\u2019s killing or risk another civil war. After three years of Lebanon having no president at all due to its internal gridlock, he argues, what real option did it have?\u000a\u000a\u201cWe saw that if we continue this, we\u2019re going to end up like Syria or we\u2019re going to end up like Iraq,\u201d as he puts it.\u000a\u000aBut every day is a challenge. While he was in Washington, in fact, Hezbollah attacked along Lebanon\u2019s borders with Syria to take back territory held by the Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front and ISIS in Syria, a decision Hariri acknowledges the Lebanese armed forces had nothing to do with. \u201cHezbollah decided unilaterally to \u2026 go into Syria without taking the advice of the government,\u201d he tells me. (Hezbollah, of course, is already in Syria in a major way \u2014 fighting Sunni rebel groups on behalf of the Assad regime and Iran.)\u000a\u000aAs for Washington\u2019s demands for more sanctions against Hezbollah and the growing impatience of Iran hawks in the Trump administration, Hariri makes the case that the United States would be better off focusing not on the Iranian proxy in his government \u2014 but on Iran itself.\u000a\u000aBesides, he acknowledges, that\u2019s a matter for someone other than fragile Lebanon to sort out.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur thought is, you know, Hezbollah is a regional issue. It\u2019s not a Lebanese issue anymore. Hezbollah is in Syria and Iraq and Yemen, so people should not focus on Hezbollah that it\u2019s a Lebanese entity only, but it\u2019s something regional. In order to solve this issue, or to even work around it, it has to be a regional understanding. So, I am the prime minister of Lebanon. I\u2019m not going to enter into that regional conflict. All I want is to \u2026 safeguard my country, because we\u2019ve been through civil war. We\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019ve paid 200,000 people who got killed in the civil war.\u201d\u000a\u000aLebanon, as Hariri reminds me throughout the interview, is a small country in a tough neighborhood. He\u2019s not in Washington to preach, but to ask, and his mission is not to tell the great powers what to do about Syria or Hezbollah or Iran.\u000a\u000a\u201cLebanon is a small country, and we have a saying: \u2018As long as you know your size, you know, just try to protect what you have,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think this is what we\u2019re trying to do. And I believe this policy has saved Lebanon so far.\u201d\u000a\u000aSusan Glasser is POLITICO\u2019s chief international affairs columnist and host of its new weekly podcast, The Global Politico.

aVPresident Donald Trump did not indicate a specific story from the Times that had drawn his ire. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Trump claims his base is 'getting stronger' despite 'fake news'\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump began his 200th day in office on Monday in the same way that he has started so many others since moving into the White House: by attacking the media on Twitter.\u000a\u000a"Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!" he tweeted.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMinutes earlier, the president launched into a multipart Twitter post complaining more generally about the media, lashing out over polls showing his approval ratings at or near historic lows for a president so early in his first term. Those numbers, much like the polls leading up to last November's presidential election that suggested he would lose, are misreading Trump's support among the American people, Trump wrote.\u000a\u000a"The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling).

aVIf, as he has clearly signaled, President Donald Trump chooses in the coming months to hold Iran in noncompliance of the nuclear accord, the impact will be felt in Tehran and the already volatile Middle East.\u000a\u000aBut the more serious casualty could be both more widespread and more distant\u2014thousands of miles away, on the Korean Peninsula. And the Trump administration needs to begin connecting the dots now.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe United States has few options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear challenge, and no good ones. A pre-emptive strike risks an unspeakable catastrophe. Sanctions have not worked, and tightening them further is no more likely to. Diplomatic talks will be difficult for the United States because an agreement would involve a compromise that would allow North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, if the goal is to prevent Pyongyang from developing an accurate nuclear-tipped ICBM, then negotiating with Pyongyang may well be the only way to try to defuse a looming crisis.\u000a\u000aEven under current conditions, such talks would be fraught, the odds tilted against success. But if the U.S. thrusts aside the nuclear deal with Iran\u2014and uses contrived evidence to do so\u2014the message to North Korea and others will be that America\u2019s word is disposable and the U.S. cannot be trusted to honor its commitments. This would deal a possibly fatal blow to any chance of a diplomatic effort to, if not halt or reverse, at a minimum slow down North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u000a\u000aIndeed, walking away from the Iran deal, or contriving circumstances that force Iran to do so, would not only open up a now dormant nuclear crisis with Tehran, it would also close down perhaps the only option that might prevent a far more dangerous crisis with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea already harbors heightened suspicion and mistrust of Washington\u2019s motives, fearing that the U.S.\u2019 real objective is removal of the Kim regime and reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korean leadership. U.S. abandonment, without just cause, of the Iran deal would both validate and exacerbate those beliefs; to Pyongyang, the lesson would be that Washington saw diplomacy merely as a prelude to efforts to isolate, pressure and seek to remove the Iranian regime. Why would Kim Jong Un even begin negotiations if he is convinced that Washington would then look for excuses to unravel an agreement, should one be reached?\u000a\u000aThe message from Washington, of course, would not be heard in Pyongyang alone. The administration\u2019s too-clever-by-half strategy of messing around with the Iranian nuclear accord\u2014doing just enough to tempt Tehran to walk away from the deal after Trump publicly acknowledged that his goal is to undo it\u2014almost certainly would undermine its credibility with nations whose cooperation it desperately needs to deal with the North Korean nuclear challenge. The recent unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea demonstrates two things: first, that a unilateral U.S. approach is impracticable; and second, that China and Russia can be useful partners in pressing Pyongyang on its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. If anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aBut consider China\u2019s reaction should the U.S. treat the nuclear agreement with Iran in a slapdash, dismissive manner. Beijing might well be angered given its interests in buying Iran\u2019s oil and investing in its infrastructure. But it would be positively alarmed at the implications for North Korea, which presents China with a major security headache on its doorstep. China long has maintained that diplomacy with Pyongyang is the only viable answer to the North Korean nuclear problem, and it believes in the six-party format, which, not entirely unlike the seven-party format of the Iran negotiations, includes both China and the U.S. The precedent of the U.S. effectively dismissing an accord negotiated by a team of countries and ratified by the U.N. Security Council would give China considerable pause, raise serious questions in its mind about whether the U.S. can be trusted not to act similarly with North Korea, and make it virtually impossible for Beijing to vouch for Washington\u2019s good faith vis-à-vis Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aAllies also might lose faith. Throughout the long-simmering nuclear crisis with North Korea, the Bush and Obama administrations managed to preserve solidarity with South Korea and Japan. Going forward, any sustainable solution to this crisis will require implementation of a joint U.S.-South Korea strategy backed by Japan. Moon Jae-In, South Korea\u2019s newly elected president, is a strong proponent of engagement with the North, and both Seoul and Tokyo are desperate to contain the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. It\u2019s hardly an exaggeration to suggest that both would be apoplectic if, by repudiating the nuclear accord with Iran, the U.S. effectively cut off the path to a diplomatic solution on the peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently offered the welcome suggestion that the U.S. is open to diplomacy and reassurance to Pyongyang that the U.S. is not intent on regime change. Surely, both he and others in the administration\u2014Generals James Mattis, H.R. McMaster and John Kelly in particular, all of whom reportedly lobbied for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear accord the last time around\u2014understand how hollow those words will ring if, the next time certification is in play, they fail to persuade the president. The least one can hope is that they will see the linkage, because it\u2019s a pretty good bet that this president won\u2019t. And it\u2019s just as good a bet that, by failing to peek just around the corner, he would be creating the prospect of a two-front nuclear crisis that America and the world can ill afford.\u000a\u000aAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aRichard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

aVLISBON \u2014 After the best part of a decade of recession and stagnation, Portugal finally looked to be getting back on its feet. Then it all went wrong.\u000a\u000aIn June, just one day after the country had been freed from eight years of EU-imposed austerity measures, forest fires swept through the country, killing 64 people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Portuguese people have been shaken by the greatest catastrophe of recent decades,\u201d Prime Minister António Costa told parliament in his State of the Nation speech. \u201cIn less than 24 hours we passed from relief to turmoil, from satisfaction to consternation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fires weren\u2019t the only crisis that Costa\u2019s government had to deal with over the summer as the mood turned somber in a country that had been on a roll after being crowned European football champions for the first time last summer, had crooned its way to victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, and got its man placed at the head of the United Nations.\u000a\u000aTwo weeks after the fires, the nation\u2019s self-confidence suffered another blow when thieves broke into a military base northeast of Lisbon.\u000a\u000aTheir haul reportedly included 44 rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons, 150 hand grenades, 264 blocks of plastic explosives, dozens of detonators and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears\u201d \u2014 Opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho\u000a\u000aAs rumors circulated that the weapons were destined for international terrorists or organized crime gangs, the heist was viewed as a national humiliation that undermined the trust of NATO allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis calls into question the prestige of Portugal, the prestige of the armed forces, the authority of the state and the security of the Portuguese people,\u201d Marcelo Rebel de Sousa, Portugal\u2019s figurehead president, said after the theft at the base at Tancos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m demanding a full and complete investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be done no matter who it hurts, and nobody is immune.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta faced demands for cabinet resignations as his Socialist (PS) government and the center-right opposition traded accusations over who was to blame for defense cuts that left the army with unguarded perimeter fences and broken surveillance systems; greed-driven forestry regimes that made the countryside flammable; chaotic civil defense planning; and investments in dysfunctional communication systems that hindered warnings as walls of flame roared toward defenseless villages and crowded highways.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister himself was lambasted for vacationing in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands as security concerns and political tensions rose amid the fallout from the arms heist.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears,\u201d opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho told supporters of his center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD). \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of leadership and a lack of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta resisted calls to fire his interior and defense ministers, but then faced a further blow when three junior ministers resigned as the state prosecutors\u2019 office was poised to formally name them in an investigation into all-expenses-paid trips to last year\u2019s European football championship in France, allegedly offered by Galp Energeia, a power company.\u000a\u000aPopularity persists\u000a\u000aMinisters acknowledge the government is facing its most difficult time since coming to power in November 2015.\u000a\u000aStill, the Socialists have hit back, claiming that problems behind the fires and the robbery lie with the austerity-driven policies of the previous government led by Passos Coelho. The center-right has also been embarrassed by reports that three of its elected officials accepted a junket paid for by Chinese tech company Huawei.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down\u201d \u2014 Political expert André Azevedo Alves\u000a\u000aSo far, the gloom appears to have done little to hurt the government\u2019s popularity.\u000a\u000aCosta remains by far the most popular party leader. He enjoys a 48.9 percent approval rating, according to a poll published Saturday in the weekly Expresso newspaper. With a drop of just 0.6 points over the past two months, he\u2019s way ahead of Passos Coelho on 39.2 percent.\u000a\u000aThe PS has even increased its lead. Saturday\u2019s poll had the party at 40.8 percent, up 0.4 percent on July. The PSD dropped back to 28.1 percent.\u000a\u000aNor is there any sign that voters disaffected by the summer crises are turning to the two far-left parties that shore up Costa\u2019s minority government.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) is on 7.6 percent and the Left Bloc (BE) on 8.4 percent. Both have been steadily losing support since the October 2015 general election that brought Costa to power.\u000a\u000aHowever, analysts say the summer events could still take their toll.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen any really substantial impact on the polls, but this could mark a turning point over the longer term,\u201d said André Azevedo Alves, a political expert at Lisbon\u2019s Catholic University of Portugal and St. Mary\u2019s University, London.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tragic scale of the fires and the manner of the robbery at Tancos reflects on the institutions of state and could have a corrosive effect,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until now everything appeared to be going well under this government, we\u2019d been exceeding expectations, now things are going worse than expected.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeftists flex their muscles\u000a\u000aCosta now faces two crucial mid-term tests: Nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October 1 and the opening on August 21 of negotiations with his far-left partners on next year\u2019s state budget.\u000a\u000aThe leftists are demanding concessions. After two years of waving through budget bills that have won EU plaudits and brought the deficit down to its lowest level since democracy was restored in 1974, they\u2019re demanding a faster roll back of austerity.\u000a\u000aLeft Bloc leader Catarina Martins has been addressing party rallies around the country, cranking up pressure over the budget. Her demands range from tax breaks for the low earners to lowering the retirement age and more money for civil servants, pensions and public services.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a country where a mother who works full time and earns the minimum wage lives in poverty because the wage is so low that she cannot support herself and her child,\u201d Martins told a rally Thursday in Monte Gordo, a popular vacation resort in the southern Algarve region. \u201cNobody should be left behind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe very public demands of both far-left parties will make it harder to strike a deal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down,\u201d said Azevedo Alves. \u201cThere are ways out of this, but it will be more of a challenge than in previous years.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the rosier economic climate, unions are also demanding more.\u000a\u000aWorkers at the Autoeuropa car plant \u2014 the country\u2019s third biggest exporter \u2014 are threatening a strike to interrupt production of Volkswagen\u2019s new T-ROC model. They voted to reject a deal on wages and working time which, the company said, included a 16 percent pay rise for some workers.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.\u000a\u000aVenezuela is another source of tension between the government and its hard-left backers.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communists on Thursday issued a statement denouncing protests against Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro as \u201cdestabilizing, terrorist and putschist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe PCP criticized Costa\u2019s government for signing up to the European Union position not recognizing the violence-marred elections that Maduro organized to boost his powers.\u000a\u000aDespite the strains, however, neither the PCP nor the Left Bloc have much interest in breaking up the governing partnership, which is popularly nicknamed the geringonça, or contraption.\u000a\u000aIf they rock the boat too much, they risk being shunted away from power in new elections, given that polls show the PS within reach of an absolute majority, and voters would likely penalize any party that provokes a crisis by pulling out of the governing deal.\u000a\u000aThat strengthens Costa\u2019s hand in the budget talks.\u000a\u000aThe local elections will choose mayors and councillors for the country\u2019s 308 municipalities and over 3,000 smaller parish councils. Races are often dominated by local issues and personalities, but the vote will be a barometer of national support for the parties and their leaders.\u000a\u000aCosta is hoping the Socialists will increase their current leadership of 150 municipalities, and most of all they want to hang on to Lisbon, where he served as a popular mayor before stepping down in 2015 to run for the premiership.\u000a\u000aFernando Medina, Costa\u2019s successor as mayor, has been riding on a tourism boom, investing in a spate of urban embellishment projects to give the capital a facelift. The party\u2019s national ratings have also been boosted by strong economic data.\u000a\u000aLatest Eurostat numbers released last week showed Portugal\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below the eurozone average for the first time since the crisis; growth, which is predicted at over 2.5 percent this year, will be the \u201cbest this century,\u201d according to Costa; and 2017 is on course to be the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for tourist numbers.\u000a\u000aThe PSD\u2019s challenge hasn\u2019t started well. It\u2019s challenger in the Lisbon mayoral race, Teresa Leal Coelho, made a gaffe-plagued opening to her campaign \u2014 confusing Passos Coelho with a previous party leader; making promises to abolish taxes that are beyond the mayor\u2019s remit; and releasing campaign posters apparently missing their slogans.\u000a\u000aThe party has also suffered a high-profile spat over Passos Coelho\u2019s refusal to disown a candidate running in the commuter town of Loures who spouted pejorative remarks about the local Roma community.\u000a\u000aRivals within the PSD have been sharpening their knives for Passos Coelho ever since he lost the premiership in 2015. A poor showing in October could see the former prime minister ousted.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.

aVWASHINGTON \u2014 Media bashing has become one of the organizing principles of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. But behind the scenes, the Trump machine is eagerly promoting the nuggets of positive press it receives from the very outlets the president seeks to discredit.\u000a\u000aThe White House director of rapid response, Andy Hemming, 31, spends his days immersed in cable television, Twitter, print and online media to suss out positive stories about Trump, which he blasts back out to his list of more than 1,000 influencers \u2014 mainly reporters, but also television talking heads \u2014 who together craft the overall story of Trump\u2019s presidency.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s nothing new about an administration trying to promote its wins. But in the Trump White House, where Hemming\u2019s job is not to discredit the mainstream media but to celebrate stories the administration likes, it can seem like he is trying to bail out a sinking boat with a teacup.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s a role that feels out of sync with Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the press. Trump spent the first day of his summer break Monday tweetstorming about the country\u2019s major cable networks and newspapers. \u201cHard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is installed on his golf course for a two-week vacation.\u000a\u000aHe followed up later on a wet, unconducive-to-golfing afternoon, with a honed Twitter attack launched at his favorite target: \u201cHow much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat makes it so audacious and confusing is that no president has been so outspoken \u2014 and outrageous \u2014 about impeaching mainstream news outlets\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama\u000a\u000aA New York Times spokesperson said the business is actually growing in profit, income, revenues and paid subscriptions.\u000a\u000aIn July, Trump posted a video of himself wrestling to the ground a man with a CNN logo obscuring his face \u2014 a post that has since been retweeted more than 370,000 times. But Hemming that same month highlighted clips from the network, including one of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein telling anchor Wolf Blitzer she saw no evidence of collusion between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t always get it wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of mainstream news outlets like The New York Times and CNN. \u201cBut for every one good story we push out, there are probably 150 really bad process stories, or hit pieces, on the administration. We think a lot of times, the stories that we push out have been given very little coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn July 18, for instance, while Trump tweeted about the \u201cFake News story of secret dinner with Putin\u201d \u2014 he called the story \u201csick\u201d \u2014 Hemming was highlighting a story from the allegedly ailing Grey Lady.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe New York Times\u2019 Carl Hulse has a solid explainer on the Senate Democrats\u2019 unprecedented effort to block President Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d Hemming wrote, with a link to the story. Earlier in July, Hemming emailed out a New York Times piece that he called \u201ca good article on how small businesses across the country are cheering President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an important role,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign spokesman who worked closely with Hemming from the 2016 war room in Trump Tower. \u201cThere\u2019s so much good news that\u2019s coming out of this administration, that we have to continue pushing all of these positive messages ourselves to remind people there\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d (Miller is now a paid contributor on CNN.)\u000a\u000aHemming, who is paid $89,000 a year, is a career Republican campaign operative who until he entered Trump\u2019s orbit had worked for establishment GOP figures like Meg Whitman, during her failed run for governor in California; Mitt Romney, during his unsuccessful 2012 bid for president; and Greg Abbott, during his successful run for Texas governor. Last year, he worked for former Texas Governor Rick Perry\u2019s campaign before going to the Republican National Committee and being embedded in Trump Tower for the final 100 days of the general election.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s always been a behind-the-scenes operative, associates said, but for the first few weeks of the administration, Hemming was toiling, perhaps for the first time in his life, in total obscurity. Hemming would blast out his carefully curated clips, sometimes multiple times a day, with the goal of driving more positive news coverage.\u000a\u000aBut for weeks, sources inside the White House said, no one informed him that the White House IT system could not handle an email going out to such a big list, and all of his emails were being blocked by a firewall and reaching an audience of zero readers. That glitch has since been corrected, and the administration thinks Hemming is helping to slowly change the course of the coverage it gets.\u000a\u000a\u201cAndy does an incredible job of finding those hidden gems and trying to amplify those positive messages,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s quick, and I would say he has a very good pulse on what\u2019s hot, but also on what wasn\u2019t hot but should be.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe declined to comment for this story.\u000a\u000aThe fact-checker column in the newspaper Trump now refers to disparagingly as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d has been highlighted by Hemming and the rapid response team on multiple occasions, for example, for knocking down misleading statements about Trump\u2019s policies made by lawmakers like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Kamala Harris, also a California Democrat.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat makes it so audacious and confusing is that no president has been so outspoken \u2014 and outrageous \u2014 about impeaching mainstream news outlets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, who is also a paid CNN analyst. \u201cIf these outlets are \u2018fake,\u2019 then why should we believe that their positive reporting about the president and the administration is real? It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment that, despite the president\u2019s calculated and persistent assaults, these news sources are very credible.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso undercutting Trump\u2019s constant assaults, Axelrod noted, is how Trump frequently participates in interviews with reporters representing the very news organization he rails against.\u000a\u000aOthers warned that to take Trump literally is to misunderstand the president. \u201cUnderstanding Trump means you have to have a healthy dose of humor and skepticism about the spoken word,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aOf the White House\u2019s efforts to promote stories from the same organizations the president discredits, Fleischer pointed to a moment last March, when former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the monthly jobs numbers produced by the labor department that Trump had previously discredited \u201cmay have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you square it?\u201d asked Fleischer. \u201cYou square it with a smile.\u201d

aVRobert Mueller | Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images Forum Robert Mueller impaneled a grand jury. Here\u2019s what it means. Special Counsel Mueller believes there is sufficient evidence a crime was committed to warrant a criminal investigation.\u000a\u000aThursday\u2019s news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller impaneled a grand jury as part of his ongoing investigation jolted Washington and sent pundits to the airwaves, seeking to explain what this latest twist in the Russia story might tell us about President Trump\u2019s ultimate fate.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no doubt that this move is significant: It means Mueller believes there is sufficient evidence a crime was committed to warrant a criminal investigation. But people are leaping to conclusions that the public evidence doesn\u2019t yet support.\u000a\u000aOnly a grand jury can issue an indictment, which is the only way that someone can be charged with committing a felony pursuant to the U.S. Constitution. Merely impaneling a grand jury does not mean that Mueller will ultimately seek an indictment, although most grand jury investigations do result in someone being indicted. When a prosecutor does seek an indictment, one is almost always returned by the grand jury \u2014 hence the old saying a grand jury would \u201cindict a ham sandwich\u201d if asked.\u000a\u000aA grand jury, which consists of 16 to 23 people, is an important tool that allows prosecutors to issue subpoenas that require people to produce documents and other evidence. Subpoenas can also be used to compel people to testify under oath before the grand jury. You can expect Mueller and his team to issue many subpoenas in the months ahead.\u000a\u000aBecause grand jury subpoenas are an important prosecutorial tool, typically a grand jury is impaneled at the very beginning of an investigation, not at the end. Indictments are usually sought at the very end of an investigation, after all of the witnesses are questioned and all of the documents are obtained. So despite all the punditry on cable news, there\u2019s no suggestion here that Mueller is closing in on any particular target, such as the president. In all likelihood, he\u2019s just getting started.\u000a\u000aIt is possible, though, that as a starting point Mueller will eventually seek an indictment of a lower-level figure in or around Trump\u2019s campaign. Sometimes, when prosecutors are facing obstacles in obtaining evidence, they seek an indictment of one individual or a group of individuals prior to completing their investigation, if they believe that those individuals might cooperate with the government and provide evidence. Otherwise, decisions about who to charge are left to the very end of the investigation.\u000a\u000aThe work that grand juries do is secret, which means that grand jurors \u2014 who are ordinary citizens chosen at random and vetted by the federal district court \u2014 cannot share what is happening before the grand jury. Federal rules also prevent prosecutors from disclosing what happens before the grand jury. But those same rules permit witnesses to disclose what happened, and people who receive grand jury subpoenas are usually not prohibited from disclosing their contents. That means that we will likely continue to hear media reports about witnesses and documents sought by Mueller and his team, as we did on Thursday.\u000a\u000aOne quirk of grand juries could be significant. When a witness testifies under oath before the grand jury, no one else is permitted to be present other than the prosecutor and the grand jurors. The witness is not even allowed to have a lawyer present, and the normal rules of evidence that limit questioning in a trial do not apply. For that reason, when witnesses receive a grand jury subpoena, their lawyer often asks the prosecutor to agree to permit the witness to be interviewed by the prosecutor and a FBI agent with the lawyer present. The FBI agent\u2019s presence would make it a crime to lie during the interview \u2014 creating the risk of Trump or one of his associates committing a crime through their words \u2014 but the lawyer would be present and could assist the witness.\u000a\u000aThat said, interviews are not typically transcribed, even though the FBI agent prepares a report memorializing the interview. For that reason, when it is important for a prosecutor to pin down a witness\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor will insist that the witness testify under oath before the grand jury. For example, President Bill Clinton testified before a grand jury in the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr \u2014 who later accused Clinton of providing \u201cperjurious, false and misleading testimony,\u201d leading to his impeachment by the Republican-led House of Representatives.\u000a\u000aAs for Trump, we\u2019re probably a long way from learning whether he\u2019s broken any laws, although he very well may be in Mueller\u2019s sights. The fact that a grand jury has been impaneled does not impact whether Mueller will be fired, as the president has threatened to do, and it does not in any way restrict the bounds of his investigation.\u000a\u000aThat said, as a practical matter, the existence of a grand jury investigation confirms that Mueller is conducting a criminal investigation, not merely a counterintelligence investigation. It\u2019s possible that the existence of a federal criminal investigation might increase the political cost of firing Mueller. Republican senators have already warned there will be \u201chell to pay\u201d if Trump fires Jeff Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia investigation has enraged and frustrated the president, so that he can hire a more pliant attorney general.\u000a\u000aThat said, Thursday\u2019s news is not surprising. Mueller has already hired 16 prosecutors \u2014 some of the most accomplished investigators ever assembled on one team. These are people with deep skills and experience in prosecuting cases on money laundering, campaign finance violations and foreign bribery, as well as a sophisticated understanding of how to handle sprawling, complex investigations like this one. If any crimes were committed, they\u2019re likely to find out.\u000a\u000aThe evidence in the public domain was already enough to warrant an investigation, which is why Mueller was appointed in the first place. Now, the existence of a grand jury confirms what many of us presumed, which is that Mueller was conducting a wide-ranging criminal investigation. What we don\u2019t know is what, if anything, they will uncover.\u000a\u000aRenato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor who handled many obstruction cases. He is now a partner at Thompson Coburn LLP.

aVTrump endorses bill to halve legal immigration The bill sells itself as a way to raise wages and create jobs \u2014 and it would drastically reduce legal immigration over the next decade.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump came out Wednesday for a bill that would reduce legal immigration by one-half over the next decade.\u000a\u000aTrump joined Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia to present a reworked version of the so-called RAISE Act, S. 354 (115), which the senators introduced in February. Like the original measure, the revised bill would, over 10 years, reduce legal immigration to roughly 500,000 annually, down from the current level of about 1 million.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe bill would favor worker skills over family ties in determining who may immigrate to the U.S., and \u201cwould represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half a century," Trump said. The president appeared to refer to the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, a landmark Great Society law that ended four decades of strict limitations and vastly increased immigration by non-Europeans.\u000a\u000aBut the Cotton-Perdue bill faces steep odds of becoming law, given likely opposition from Democrats and pro-immigration Republicans. In a written statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that while "I've always supported merit-based immigration," the bill's halving of immigration "would be devastating to our state\u2019s economy."\u000a\u000aTrump, along with Cotton and Perdue, stressed that a reduction in legal immigration and a shift to skills-based admissions would boost wages for U.S. workers and promote economic growth. That view conflicts with a near consensus among economists that economic growth will require a large expansion of the U.S. workforce.\u000a\u000aCotton, a strong proponent of lower immigration levels, called the current immigration system \u201can obsolete disaster,\u201d ripe for reform. He said the current annual level of legal immigration equals the population of Montana, and stressed that today most new lawful permanent residents come to the U.S. because of family ties.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Spouses and minor children would still have preference under the measure.\u000a\u000aThe legislation would also eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which makes available 50,000 visas to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the bill would cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000, the level Trump called for in the travel ban executive order that he issued in March.\u000a\u000aTo rank incoming immigrants, the legislation would institute a \u201cpoints system\u201d similar to the admissions processes in Canada and Australia. Among the criteria would be education, English-language ability, prospective salary, age, entrepreneurship and past achievements.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVAfter President Donald Trump took to Twitter last week to announce a militarywide ban on transgender personnel, one former Navy SEAL lobbed a warning at the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou just smacked the hornet\u2019s nest with a baseball bat, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of people who are going to start to come out of the woodwork,\u201d Kristin Beck, a transgender war veteran and Purple Heart recipient, said in the latest episode of \u201cWomen Rule.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBeck, whose past deployments included tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed deeper disappointment in Trump, saying that his ban showed \u201chate\u201d and \u201cbigotry\u201d toward those serving in the armed forces.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re a soldier, they\u2019re serving their country.

aVBy the end of last week, even President Donald Trump had apparently had enough of the self-inflicted chaos swirling around his White House. And the person he turned to to fix it \u2014 instinctively, it seems \u2014 was a retired Marine Corps general.\u000a\u000aJohn Kelly, out of uniform for just a year after retiring as head of U.S. Southern Command, had been running the Department of Homeland Security since January. He\u2019s a straight-talking and sometimes blunt man whose accent suggests his working-class Boston roots, and he enjoys a salty joke. Sources say Trump was already in the habit of asking him for advice on how to make the White House run more smoothly.\u000a\u000aNot since the early days of the Ford administration has a general served as White House chief of staff \u2014 and arguably not since the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, himself a retired general, have senior military officers wielded such influence at the top levels of an administration. Kelly forms a nexus of power with three other generals: Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a retired Marine general; Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Marine general; and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, still a uniformed lieutenant general in the Army \u2014 and a replacement for retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, who was fired after less than a month in the job.\u000a\u000aAs the administration first took shape, the heavy military make-up of the administration\u2019s national security and foreign affairs team \u2014 of its senior leadership, only Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a civilian \u2014 raised serious questions about the militarization of U.S. foreign policy. These concerns were exacerbated in February when Trump bragged his budget contained \u201cone of the largest defense-spending increases in history,\u201d and later when he handed a series of important new wartime authorities to the Pentagon, while proposing to slash the State Department budget by 30 percent.\u000a\u000aThe generals, with Tillerson as something of a junior partner \u2014 nicknamed the \u201caxis of adults\u201d by a number of establishment Republicans and conservative commentators \u2014 have become the reassurers-in-chief to the outside world.\u000a\u000aBut during the first seven months of this administration, the generals have emerged as a fairly coherent bloc of foreign-policy thinkers whose views have put at least the most extreme fears of critics to rest. Through both experience and military education, the generals are pragmatic realists and internationalists, committed to the United States\u2019 leadership role in the world. Internally, they\u2019ve been a strong counterweight to the nationalist/populist faction in the White House led by chief strategist Steve Bannon, which was behind controversial Trump policies like the initial immigration ban, the rejection of the Paris climate change accords, and potential steel tariffs that could yet spark a global trade war.\u000a\u000aTaken as a group, Trump\u2019s generals have tended to see their mission as twofold: The first job is to correct what senior military officers see as the mistakes of the Obama administration, a hesitancy to use force or commit troops that many allies perceived as a retreat from traditional U.S. commitments in the world.\u000a\u000aThe second job \u2014 and the far riskier one \u2014 is to mitigate the damage caused by their boss.\u000a\u000aAn undisciplined and shoot-from-the-lip president, Trump has shown a proclivity for rattling allies with unexpected tweets and bullying phone calls. When he trumpets his \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy, it\u2019s widely interpreted by allies as a fig leaf for isolationism and protectionism. The generals, with Tillerson as something of a junior partner \u2014 nicknamed the \u201caxis of adults\u201d by a number of establishment Republicans and conservative commentators \u2014 have become the reassurers-in-chief to the outside world. They\u2019ve already persuaded Trump to back away from some of his most controversial foreign policy positions, including labeling NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, rescinding the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, and reconsidering the venerable \u201cOne China\u201d policy.\u000a\u000aAnd they\u2019ve won some internal fights. McMaster, in particular, appears to be locked in battle with the nationalist faction: He has recently cleared out a number of senior national-security staffers associated with his predecessor Mike Flynn or seen as allied to Bannon; he\u2019s fired Rich Higgins, the strategi planning director who wrote a conspiracy-laced memo, as well as Intelligence Directorate head Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Bannon ally who earlier this year secretly shared intelligence with Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Representative Devin Nunes. For his troubles, McMaster is now under attack by Bannon\u2019s former website, Breitbart, which is covering his \u201cpurge\u201d with blazing headlines\u2014though he appears to be enjoying some protection from the arrival of Kelly. Which suggests that the more interesting internal fight may be the one Kelly is just beginning, trying to both corral a deeply disjointed White House staff and temper Trump\u2019s erratic day-to-day impulses.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake, in the minds of the generals, is something considerably larger than winning the internal Game of Thrones. In the back of his airplane returning from a recent trip to Asia, General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me that that the international order they were striving to protect was more volatile and unpredictable today than at any moment since World War II. \u201cToday, we\u2019re confronting simultaneous challenges posed by China, North Korea, Russia and Iran, as well as a natural disaster in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said, referring to flooding that had recently displaced hundreds of thousands of people. \u201cSo, as I prepare for posture hearings in Congress, that\u2019s a reminder that this is the world as it is, not the world as we might want it to be.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe world as it is also includes a global Islamist insurgency, U.S. combat operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and growing instability and state failure around the world, from Yemen to South Sudan to Venezuela. The defense of what author Robert Kagan calls \u201cThe World America Made\u201d now depends on the success of Trump\u2019s generals in the twin objectives of shaping a more muscular national security posture, and limiting the international blowback from an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy of naked nationalism and mercantilism \u2014 even as their own commander-in-chief projects that face to the world.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aWhy generals at all? Donald Trump, a flamboyant billionaire and reality-TV star who received multiple deferments from serving in Vietnam, might initially seem an unlikely boss for a clique of buttoned down military officers. But from his days at the New York Military Academy, Trump seems to have retained an innate respect for the uniform, and above all he likes tough guys. All of his top generals distinguished themselves in multiple combat tours, and Trump especially likes reminding Mattis of a former nickname he would just as soon retire, \u201cMad Dog.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor their part, the generals were qualified to step into a Trump administration in a way that few other national-security experts were: Experienced and worldly without being partisan or political, and thus not part of the \u201cWashington swamp\u201d that candidate Trump constantly promised to drain. By training, they innately respect the position of the commander-in-chief and the institution of the presidency, regardless of who holds it. And unlike many of the Republican defense and foreign policy experts in the Republican establishment, they hadn\u2019t put their names on \u201cNever Trump\u201d proclamations during the campaign.\u000a\u000aGiven that the Marine Corps is the smallest of the four major armed services, the Marines that rise to the level of general form an especially tight-knit clique.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s closest relationship was with none of his current generals, but with Flynn, a decorated combat veteran who served as the former intelligence chief for Joint Special Operations Command. The brash businessman and the maverick soldier had something in common: Both felt that America had lost the knack of \u201cwinning,\u201d either in international trade or in the global fight against Islamist extremists. The two bonded on the campaign trail, and Flynn infamously spoke at the Republican National Convention, leading the crowd in chants of \u201cLock Her Up\u201d in reference to Hillary Clinton. Flynn was eventually fired as Trump\u2019s national security adviser for his entanglement with Russia, and is now a target of the FBI\u2019s investigation \u2014 and his fall from grace presents a cautionary tale of the dangers military officers can face in entering the unfamiliar terrain of hyperpartisan politics, and the whirlpool of controversies constantly swirling around Trump.\u000a\u000aFlynn\u2019s replacement was a surprising choice for an ahistorical president who puts a premium on obsequiousness and loyalty in his subordinates: McMaster is a warrior-scholar who distinguished himself in combat, but also wrote a book called \u201cDereliction of Duty,\u201d a critique of generals who didn\u2019t speak honestly enough to their civilian bosses during the Vietnam War. He had made a career out of independent thought and speaking truth to power.\u000a\u000aMattis, similarly, has a scholarly reputation: a noted intellectual and keen student of history, Mattis sprinkles his conversations with references to Thucydides and the Peloponnesian war, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s struggle to prepare the nation for the end of slavery, and the enduring lessons of the post-World War II Marshall Plan, fashioned by his predecessor George C. Marshall, the last retired general to serve as defense secretary. (Kelly reportedly caught the eye of Team Trump for reasons a little closer to the Trump campaign themes: In testimony, he gave before the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015, he argued that a porous southern border was a potentially \u201cexistential\u201d national security threat.)\u000a\u000aGiven that the Marine Corps is the smallest of the four major armed services, the Marines that rise to the level of general form an especially tight-knit clique. Kelly and Joint Chiefs Chairman Joe Dunford served under Mattis multiple times in combat in Iraq, close aides say, and the three talk frequently and meet often at national security meetings and retirement ceremonies. It was General Dunford who personally delivered the heartbreaking news to Kelly that his son, 2nd Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2011.\u000a\u000aAs a group, Trump\u2019s generals are united by bonds of friendship, common experience and wartime sacrifice. By the nature of their military education \u2014 and the U.S. military\u2019s constant overseas deployments of the past two decades\u2014they\u2019re also well steeped in international relations, and deeply committed to the global alliance structure that the U.S. military built and maintained after World War II. Their wartime experiences have also made them sensitive to looming threats, whether from Islamist extremists, a hegemonic Iran, and especially a revanchist Russia that has targeted Western democracies as its enemies.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aThey also have one more thing in common: Serious worries about the Obama Doctrine. Though in the broad sense, the generals are clearly embracing continuity in America\u2019s relationship to the world, almost to a man they had taken positions in public opposition to aspects of Obama\u2019s second-term foreign policy.\u000a\u000aMattis had been eased out as head of U.S. Central Command because of his harsh rhetoric about Iran at a time when the administration was negotiating an agreement to curtail Tehran\u2019s suspected nuclear weapons program. As head of U.S. Southern Command, Kelly got sideways with the Obama White House for calling attention to the threats posed by a porous southern border. McMaster was publicly critical of Obama\u2019s precooked deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. And Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, thought Obama was severely underestimating the threat of Islamic extremism in the Middle East. He believed he was let go early as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency for pushing back on the notion that the threat from Islamist extremism had largely passed with the death of Osama bin Laden.\u000a\u000aSenior uniformed leaders privately blame Obama\u2019s decision to prematurely pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011 for the rise of the Islamic State there, and they felt overly constrained by the White House\u2019s extreme sensitivity to \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in the anti-ISIS campaign. Troop levels have thus been increased in Iraq and Syria under Trump, and the anti-ISIS campaign intensified. The request for additional authorities itself arose out of a widespread belief that Obama\u2019s White House micromanaged military operations by insisting that military commanders constantly ask, \u201cMother, may I?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe influence of their beliefs can be seen in Trump\u2019s sometimes arbitrary-seeming foreign policy decisions. In the Obama administration\u2019s eagerness to reach a deal curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Mattis in particular felt that too little was done to reassure traditional Sunni Arab allies, and push back against Tehran\u2019s support of terrorist proxies throughout the region. Trump thus traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year in one of his initial overseas trips, where he rallied the Sunni Arab states and announced a major weapons sale to Riyadh. After recently certifying that Iran was in compliance with the nuclear accord, the Trump administration nevertheless slapped new sanctions on Tehran for its support for terrorists and its meddling throughout the Middle East.\u000a\u000aIn a recent interview, Mattis referred to this belief that Obama failed to finish the job of destroying Al Qaeda and its offshoots. \u201cI think under the Obama administration, there was a more accelerated campaign against terrorists than perhaps the administration was willing to sustain,\u201d Mattis said in an interview with The Islander, the newspaper of the Mercer Island High School. As for Tehran, Mattis said, \u201cIran is certainly the most destabilizing influence in the Middle East.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. military leaders like McMaster have also publicly faulted Obama for setting an artificial deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, and for setting too steep of a glide path for those withdrawals. The Pentagon and McMaster thus support the deployment of roughly 4,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan to halt recent Taliban gains \u2014 a policy reportedly opposed by Bannon and his allies in the White House. Trump has yet to weigh in decisively on either side.\u000a\u000a\u201cThank God for the generals. \u2026 President Trump\u2019s senior military appointees are taking a leading role and acting as a restraining influence\u201d \u2014 Eric Fehrnstrom\u000a\u000a\u201cWe saw with the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, and the subsequent fall of Mosul, what can happen when you withdraw before making your military gains permanent,\u201d McMaster said at a recent conference hosted by the Center for a New American Security.\u000a\u000aFinally, U.S. military leaders almost uniformly believed it was a mistake for President Obama to draw a rhetorical red line against the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons, and then fail to enforce it with military action when Assad gassed scores of civilians in 2013 with sarin nerve agent. When Assad crossed that line again last April, the Trump national security team responded with what looked like choreographed diplomacy backed by military muscle. Within days Secretary of Defense Mattis directed a missile strike against the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons against civilians, even as Trump held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago about putting increased pressure on North Korea over planned nuclear tests. The missile attack on the murderous Assad regime was applauded by Democrats and Republicans alike. Having generals running U.S. foreign policy still worried plenty of liberals, but more hawkish mainstream commentators began talking of Trump\u2019s generals and Tillerson as a stabilizing force that had finally brought much-needed discipline and strategic coherence to the administration\u2019s national security and foreign policies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe same President Trump who can be gruff and erratic in public tweets is a commander-in-chief who is deferential and attentive when he talks to a star-studded cast of his closest military advisers,\u201d national security reporter Rowan Scarborough wrote at the time in the Washington Times. Chimed in Eric Fehrnstrom, a former Mitt Romney aide, in the Boston Globe: \u201cThank God for the generals. \u2026 President Trump\u2019s senior military appointees are taking a leading role and acting as a restraining influence.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aNowhere is the influence of Trump\u2019s \u201caxis of adults\u201d felt more acutely than overseas, where worried allies look for reassurance that \u201cAmerica first\u201d does not mean a U.S. retreat. With the administration approaching the six-month mark in June, for instance, Secretary of Defense Mattis and Secretary of State Tillerson appeared together at a news conference for the very first time \u2014 not in the US, but in Australia. The briefing at the annual Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) was a chance for a close ally to view Team Trump\u2019s new power dynamic up close, and for American participants and observers to judge how the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy was playing overseas.\u000a\u000aAs partnerships go, the U.S.-Australian alliance is as rock solid as they come \u2013 but there are no more easy alliances for the United States. After Mattis, Tillerson and their Australian counterparts gave prepared remarks extolling their joint commitment to the \u201crules-based international order\u201d \u2014 shorthand for a U.S.-backed system predicated on free trade and freedom from intimidation \u2014 that uneasiness was driven home by questions from the assembled press. Tillerson, who had made few public appearances, took a long, tough question from an American reporter about how the Trump administration has \u201ctossed aside\u201d free trade and climate change pacts, risking being seen as \u201cAmerica the Selfish,\u201d or \u201cAmerica the Boorish.\u201d \u201cDo the president\u2019s words no longer matter in international relations?\u201d the reporter asked. By the end of the harangue Tillerson\u2019s right hand was wagging in tight circles in an unmistakable gesture of wrap it up already.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t have more?\u201d Tillerson asked the reporter sarcastically, before launching into a defense of presidential policies and pronouncements that would be difficult for even the most seasoned diplomat to defend. Mattis took a stab and was equally unpersuasive. For her part, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop offered a defense of her guests that has become increasingly common for bewildered allies, one that attempts to sidestep the president\u2019s preferred bully pulpit: We will react to what the administration does, and not what the president Tweets. \u201cI understand Twitter has a maximum of 140 characters,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we will deal with the president, with his cabinet, and with this administration on what they do, what they achieve, and what their strategies are.\u201d\u000a\u000aJust days earlier in Singapore I had watched as Mattis was similarly cornered at the Shangri-La Dialogue. During a speech to Asian leaders and national security experts, he gave a rousing defense of traditional U.S. leadership, referring to America\u2019s \u201cenduring commitment\u201d to Asian-Pacific allies based on \u201cstrategic interests and on the shared values of free peoples and free markets.\u201d He promised that the United States would continue to defend \u201cthe rules-based international order\u201d constructed by the United States out of the wreckage of World War II.\u000a\u000aThe cognitive dissonance of the Trump administration\u2019s messaging was just as confusing to the political leaders and security experts in Singapore as it was to the press scrum in Australia. In the question-and-answer session after Mattis\u2019 speech, a delegate from Singapore wondered why the United States wasn\u2019t more worried that China was aggressively filling the trade vacuum left by its rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. An Australian delegate questioned whether the administration\u2019s rejection of TPP and the Paris Climate Accord, and its bruising treatment of NATO, meant that Trump really wanted to deconstruct the rules-based international order. A Japanese parliamentarian wondered whether her nation\u2019s security alliance with the United States was still based on common values like free trade, environmental protection and human rights.\u000a\u000aMattis, typically, tried to place the current moment into a historic context, pointing out that there has long been a strain of isolationism in the American body politic, and a reluctance to serve as the world\u2019s policeman. But after witnessing the carnage of tens of millions of people in World War II, Mattis noted, the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d recognized the danger of countries once again retreating back inside their own borders \u2014 implying, without saying outright, that it would prevail over Trumpian \u201cus first\u201d nationalism. \u201cEven for all the frustrations that are felt in America right now and the sense that at times we carry an inordinate burden, that sense of engagement with the world is still deeply rooted in the American psyche,\u201d said Mattis. And then, and not for the last time, he paraphrased Britain\u2019s World War II-era leader and statesman Winston Churchill to explain Washington\u2019s wavering leadership. \u201cBear with us,\u201d he told the Shangri-La Dialogue audience. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfterward, on his aircraft flying home from Asia, Dunford told me that the president\u2019s tweets never came up in the private meetings he and Mattis held with allied leaders. \u201cI know there\u2019s been noise about the United States supposedly walking away from our Asian allies. That narrative is real and it\u2019s out there in the media,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you look at the facts, we have a pretty compelling story to tell. We are devoting 60 percent of our joint forces to U.S. Pacific Command, and we\u2019ve overseen a significant increase in the volume of multilateral military exercises in Asia. We\u2019ve deployed the newest and most capable weapons in the U.S. arsenal to the Pacific. So we\u2019re matching our actions to the message that the United States remains committed to the Asia-Pacific.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe message was meant as reassurance, and from my discussions with nervous Asian allies in Singapore extremely welcome. And yet everyone understands who ultimately calls the shots in the American system. Recently, Trump had gotten into a spat with the new leader of South Korea over who should pay for the deployment of a U.S. antimissile system to that treaty ally, which faces an existential threat from North Korea. Meanwhile, some of Trump\u2019s advisers were pushing a new tariff on steel imports that could spark a global trade war. That reminded me of something else that Mattis had said during the question-and-answer session at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen was the last time you saw a 70-year-old man change for the better?\u201d \u2014 Robert Bear\u000a\u000a\u201cAs for the rules-based order, obviously we have a new president in Washington, D.C. We\u2019re all aware of that,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cAnd there are going to be fresh approaches taken.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aSince it emerged, the flaw in the \u201caxis of adults\u201d narrative is the assumption that Donald Trump himself is willing and able to fundamentally change. If generals like McMaster, Mattis, Dunford and Kelly and the other \u201cadults\u201d among his close advisers could just establish a disciplined decision-making process, the thinking goes, then surely the best arguments will win most of the time.\u000a\u000aIn reality, despite McMaster\u2019s best efforts to instill a more orderly NSC process, knowledgeable sources say decision-making in the Trump White House still remains a much more fluid and informal affair, with competing factions frequently at odds, decisions discussed by Trump in ad hoc klatches over dinner or lunch, and freelance players like Bannon and son-in-law and top advisor Jared Kushner often circumventing the formal chain-of-authority by being the last person in the room to whisper into Trump\u2019s ear.\u000a\u000aThe recent drama surrounding the firing or resignation of White House spokesman Sean Spicer and chief of Staff Reince Preibus suggests that John Kelly will face stiff odds in trying to wring order out of the chaos emanating from the Oval Office. His success in getting rid of 11-days-and-your-fired communications director Anthony Scaramucci, and assurances that he will be given authority to act as the gatekeeper to the Oval Office, were a start. In the end, however, the man inside the office will dictate the administration\u2019s management style.\u000a\u000a\u201cDonald Trump learned about political infighting on \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 where his management technique was to provoke fights between the different candidates and teams, and then decide who prevails by saying \u2018You\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d Robert Bear, a former Middle East case officer for the CIA, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t see him changing that style in the White House. When was the last time you saw a 70-year-old man change for the better?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe longer the disorder continues, the bigger the risk to the generals trying to keep the ship steady. The U.S. military remains by far the most respected institution in America, and current and former generals some of the most respected individuals in society, precisely because of a strict nonpartisan tradition and ability to stay above the political scrum. When the administration\u2019s travel ban targeting people from seven Muslim-majority countries was initially unveiled by Steve Bannon and company with little consultation with Cabinet officials, for instance, then-DHS Director Kelly dutifully appeared before the press to insist he was in the loop in formulating the travel ban, when clearly, he was not.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think General Kelly took a hit for his commander-in-chief that day, but you can only do that once. The second time, you lose credibility,\u201d former Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in an interview. \u201cThe larger point is, whether it\u2019s Kelly, Mattis or McMaster, you can spend a lifetime building credibility, and loose it overnight.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster edged dangerously close to that line in defending Trump\u2019s inexplicable meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, in part because of the bureau\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. When news quickly broke in the Washington Post that Trump had shared highly classified, \u201ccode word\u201d intelligence with the Russians, Trump sent McMaster out to defend the action to the press. As a clearly uncomfortable McMaster dutifully walked out to the White House lawn to issue a brief statement calling the story \u201cfalse,\u201d he unexpectedly ran into a gaggle of reporters in the West Wing.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the last place in the world I wanted to be,\u201d McMaster confessed, and no one had reason to doubt it. The next morning Trump essentially undercut McMaster\u2019s defense that the story was false by insisting in a Tweet that he had every right to share highly classified intelligence with the Russians.\u000a\u000aRetired Army Lt. Col. John Nagl is a counterinsurgency expert and former president of the Center for a New American Security, and he has known McMaster for years. \u201cI believe H.R. McMaster was given a direct order by Trump to go out and try and defend the indefensible, and his doing so is OK with me because I truly believe H.R. may one day be the person who saves the planet when the proverbial crap hits the fan,\u201d Nagl said in an interview, noting that the incident was nevertheless a blow to McMaster\u2019s hard-won reputation for honesty.\u000a\u000aAs for Mattis, who has had his own run-ins with the White House over personnel choices and other issues, knowledgeable sources say he is also increasingly frustrated. Mattis was reportedly \u201cappalled\u201d and surprised by the Trump tweet barring transgender persons from serving in uniform, and he continues to receive unsolicited suggestions from the White House. Recently, Steve Bannon tried to get Mattis to consider an idea hatched by the founder of Blackwater Worldwide to install an \u201cAmerican viceroy\u201d in Afghanistan who would run the war through \u201cprivate military units,\u201d according to a report in the New York Times; Mattis \u201clistened politely,\u201d the story said, but declined to include the idea in his review of Afghanistan policy.\u000a\u000aIn June, McMaster was finally able to persuade President Trump to publicly reaffirm a U.S. commitment to NATO\u2019s foundational Article V commitment, but not before his failure to do so at a NATO Summit the previous month badly rattled America\u2019s closest democratic allies, even prompting Germany\u2019s Prime Minister Angela Merkel to publicly lament that \u201cthe times in which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent, over. \u2026\u201d POLITICO recently reported that McMaster is \u201cincreasingly a national security adviser out of sync with his mercurial president\u201d on issues ranging from Russia, NATO, the Iran deal, and the Afghanistan strategy.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump\u2019s generals keep telling us to look at what they are doing, and not what the president is saying, but the trans-Atlantic boat has been severely rocked and there is a lingering concern in Europe that more waves and surprises are likely to come\u201d \u2014 Wolfgang Ischinger\u000a\u000aBefore moving into his West Wing office, newly minted chief of staff John Kelly had seen his own relations with Congress grow increasingly testy. Those relationships will now be key to resurrecting Trump\u2019s stalled agenda on Capitol Hill, which includes major tax reform and infrastructure initiatives. In late June, Kelly testified on Capitol Hill that he was \u201coffended\u201d by lawmakers who \u201coften threaten me and my officers\u201d for their stepped-up arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. The criticism recalled Kelly\u2019s earlier admonishment that Congress should pass new immigration laws if it didn\u2019t like the way his department was enforcing the current ones, or else just \u201cshut up.\u201d Many lawmakers were not amused.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the frequent disconnect between Trump\u2019s controversial rhetoric and stances and the \u201caxis of adults\u201d involved in clean-up duty was evident in the ongoing crisis with Qatar, home to the major U.S. airbase involved in the anti-Islamic State campaign. Shortly after Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May \u2014 during which he bonded visibly with the Saudi royals and the other monarchs of the Persian Gulf \u2014 Riyadh and the other Gulf Cooperation Council members announced a blockade of Qatar over its alleged financing of terrorism. Trump publicly backed the Saudis, working at direct cross purposes with Tillerson, who was engaged in shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East trying to defuse the crisis.\u000a\u000a\u201cTillerson\u2019s shuttle diplomacy to try and solve the Qatar crisis was a reminder that, in terms of conflict management, there is no simple substitute for U.S. diplomacy, but the crisis erupted in large part because during his visit President Trump seemed to provoke Saudi Arabia to take a hard line with Qatar,\u201d said Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the United States, and currently head of the Munich Security Conference. Similarly, European allies were relieved that McMaster and Mattis finally convinced Trump to publicly embrace Article V, he said, but lasting damage was done by Trump\u2019s unwillingness to do so during the NATO Summit.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump\u2019s hesitancy on Article V and earlier talk of NATO being \u2018obsolete\u2019 have left a lingering sense of uncertainty and unpredictability about the United States\u2019 commitment to the alliance,\u201d said Ischinger. \u201cTrump\u2019s generals keep telling us to look at what they are doing, and not what the president is saying, but the trans-Atlantic boat has been severely rocked and there is a lingering concern in Europe that more waves and surprises are likely to come.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aNo matter how hard they try, Trump\u2019s generals cannot fully mitigate the lasting damage of an \u201cAmerican first\u201d foreign policy that is often interpreted overseas as much loud boasting backed up with a military stick. Even in normal times, the United States\u2019 superpower military threatens to overshadow its soft-power diplomacy, despite the fact that generals stationed overseas are technically outranked by U.S. ambassadors. Trump\u2019s clear preference for the company of generals and his frequent military tough talk, combined with his administration\u2019s steady marginalization of the State Department, sends an even stronger signal, and one that many allies find alarming.\u000a\u000aAs the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u000a\u000aFormer Defense Secretary Robert Gates used to highlight the dangers in that vast dichotomy in funding and influence between the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom by noting that there are more people in military bands than in the entire Foreign Service \u2014 giving voice to the widespread unease among senior military leaders about being front and center in U.S. foreign policy. None of Trump\u2019s generals have forgotten that\u2019s exactly how they ended up isolated and stuck inside a broken Iraq, with little help from the State Department or a diplomatic corps that had been largely shut out of the decision-making surrounding the invasion.\u000a\u000aWhile he conducts a yearlong review to rationalize deep cuts in the State Department budget, however, Tillerson has left whole management layers of undersecretaries and assistant secretaries vacant, and the seventh floor of Foggy Bottom where he works is said by insiders to resemble a \u201cghost town.\u201d The vacancies nearly led the department to cancel the incoming class of Foreign Service officers, knowledgeable sources say, and there is a move by the White House to try and have management of refugee issues taken away from the soft power State Department and given to the hard power Department of Homeland Security.\u000a\u000aNicholas Burns is director of the Future of Diplomacy Project at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, and the former third-ranking official at the State Department. \u201cThere is a real fear in the diplomatic community that the goal of the Bannon faction in the White House is to fundamentally weaken the State Department,\u201d he said in an interview. Proposed draconian cuts in the budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the wholesale failure to fill vacancies in the leadership ranks, and efforts to strip the department of key functions, he said, have all severely undercut morale in the Foreign Service. \u201cMattis, McMaster and Tillerson are all very solid people, but there is not one senior Trump adviser with diplomatic experience, which is a terrible mistake,\u201d Burns said. Aware of the danger of an overly militarized foreign policy, Defense Secretary Mattis has forged a close relationship with Tillerson, walking over to Foggy Bottom from his home on the Navy Annex once a week for breakfast, and speaking by phone two to three times a day with Tillerson. As a commander, Mattis once testified that if Congress was going to cut the budget of the diplomatic corps, then he was going to need to buy more ammunition. Unless Tillerson can somehow reverse the slow-motion strangulation of his State Department, Mattis might want to adjust his ammo budget sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aThe problem, in the end, is that even the most thoughtful generals tend to represent just one instrument in a strategic toolbox that draws its strength from the collective capabilities of the U.S. government. As the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Michele Flournoy is co-founder of the Center for a New American Security, and previously the No. 3 official in the Pentagon, and worries about the lack of a bigger-picture approach. \u201cThere is certainly a danger of the White House becoming too disengaged from operations that put American troops in harm\u2019s way,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly the president and the White House can develop \u2018whole of government\u2019 strategies, coordinate all the tools of U.S. power to include diplomacy, and provide the necessary oversight to achieve successful outcomes. Because whether it\u2019s the war in Afghanistan or the anti-ISIS campaign, none of these issues can be solved on the battlefield alone.\u201d\u000a\u000aJames Kitfield is senior fellow at the Center for the Study of the Presidency & Congress. He is a former senior correspondent for National Journal and has written about defense, national security and foreign policy issues from Washington, D.C., for more than two decades.

aVLONDON \u2014 There is a black hole at the center of the Brexit negotiations \u2014 hard-liners can kick and scream, but it\u2019s sucking everyone into its gravitational pull. Its name is transition, and its shape is Norway.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. rejoining the European Economic Area from outside the European Union \u2014 the so-called Norway model \u2014 is European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s favorite option for a post-Brexit transitional arrangement.\u000a\u000aIt would allow for a smooth exit with minimum disruption for British business \u2014 by maintaining access to the single market \u2014 and give negotiators precious time to work out the details of a future trading arrangement. In Brussels, it is now seen as the only serious proposal that the European Commission is likely to make when it comes to a transitional deal. Five EU diplomats told POLITCO it would be a reasonable solution to the Brexit transition conundrum.\u000a\u000aTwo senior U.K. government figures, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the EU\u2019s stance on this and in recent weeks a succession of British cabinet ministers have come out in favor of a transition period of up to three years after Brexit.\u000a\u000aWhile none are yet explicitly talking about the EEA model, even Brexiteers like Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove now sing from the same hymn sheet as Brexit doves like Chancellor Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Home Secretary Amber Rudd \u2014 all emphasizing the importance of avoiding a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit for British business.\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled.\u000a\u000aThe opposition Labour Party too, appears to be gravitating toward that position. Its leader Jeremy Corbyn had said that leaving the EU also means leaving the single market (which would preclude EEA membership). But Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, told the Guardian on August 1 that the party would try to force a vote on keeping the country in the single market.\u000a\u000aInexorably, under pressure from British business, political opponents and sheer realpolitik, they are all being pushed toward an EEA transition.\u000a\u000aEFTA door is open\u000a\u000aIn the alphabet soup of variations on the fringes of the European Union, the EEA is the organization with the largest membership. It includes all EU member countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Those three states are also members (along with Switzerland) of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), a regional free-trade area that operates alongside the EU. To rejoin the EEA from outside the EU, Britain would have to join EFTA.\u000a\u000aThe bloc\u2019s spokesman Thorfinnur Omarsson confirmed to POLTICO that their door is open. \u201cWe are open to receiving a U.K. membership application,\u201d he said. EFTA has not had an indication that this is what London wants yet, but if it takes that option, then the U.K\u2019s entry into EFTA \u201cshould not be too complicated,\u201d he added. That\u2019s so long as an application comes relatively early in the negotiation process.\u000a\u000aWhile there is broad consensus in the British Cabinet that some kind of transition is required, some aspects of EFTA/EEA membership would be unappealing to Brexiteers, even temporarily. Steve Baker, a junior minister in the Brexit department who was promoted after the election, said last month that staying in the EEA post Brexit would be like \u201cputting blood in the water\u201d \u2014 indicating the soft Brexiteers can expect a fight.\u000a\u000aOne reason is that EFTA/EEA members are subject to freedom of movement. The British government\u2019s public position is still that freedom of movement will end on March 29, 2019, when the U.K. leaves the EU. But seemingly contradictory statements from Hammond, who has said it will be \u201csome time\u201d before full migration controls can be imposed, and Rudd, who has promised businesses no \u201ccliff edge\u201d on migration, suggest the government is heading toward a compromise.\u000a\u000aOne such escape clause was proposed by former chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee Crispin Blunt immediately after the election in a Times article suggesting an EEA transition. He pointed out that it would be possible to invoke powers held by EEA members to restrict freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aArticle 112 of the EEA Agreement allows a party to the agreement to unilaterally take \u201csafeguard measures\u201d to limit freedom of movement in particular regions or sectors.\u000a\u000aStephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, son of former leader Neil Kinnock and partner of former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said that the clause meant an EEA transition met all three of his party\u2019s manifesto pledges on Brexit: that the U.K. must leave the EU, retain the benefits of the single market and reform freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aThe only legal precedent for invoking it comes from Liechtenstein but, Kinnock said, \u201cif that\u2019s a deal that tiny little Liechtenstein could secure, that\u2019s something we could secure given the diplomatic and economic clout of the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s up to Theresa May and David Davis to deliver,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aKinnock is one of a group of Labour MPs seeking to ally with like-minded Conservative backbenchers to force a vote on staying in the EEA during a transition when the government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill comes to the House of Commons in September.\u000a\u000aOne Labour shadow cabinet member said it was now \u201calmost inevitable\u201d that the transition period would be the EEA model, because there is not enough time between now and the close of negotiations, likely to be in fall 2018, to devise a bespoke transition arrangement. Hammond is reported to have made a similar case to business leaders in recent days, calling for an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d transition arrangement.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Labour shadow cabinet member said EEA membership was not a permanent solution. \u201cIf you have any respect for yourself as a 21st-century global power you can\u2019t become Norway,\u201d the shadow cabinet figure said. One major downside of EEA membership outside of the EU is that you must accept the rules of the single market without having any influence over them. By leaving the EU, Britain will lose its representation in the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, as well as it right to nominate a commissioner.\u000a\u000aBrexit bill link\u000a\u000aThe EFTA/EEA option is no silver bullet to a smooth transition.\u000a\u000aIt does not cover customs arrangements and if trade disruption is to be avoided during a transition, a separate agreement would be needed to maintain or replicate the U.K.\u2019s place in the EU customs union.\u000a\u000aOne U.K. government official, meanwhile, said it would not be straightforward to rejoin the EEA, via EFTA, given the reform of the two organizations\u2019 procedures, and structures required to accommodate such a large new member. However, the official did not rule out transition inside the EEA, or \u201csomething novel, but conceptually similar.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled. Martin Selmayr, Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s head of Cabinet, on Thursday retweeted a Times article making this point with the words: \u201cVery true. Good analysis.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Commission views the transition deal as an issue for phase two of the Brexit negotiations. These can only begin if, in the fall, the European Council is satisfied that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in phase one. This judgment is likely to rest on whether the U.K. has made an acceptable proposal on the so-called Brexit bill \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the EU.\u000a\u000aReports in the British press that U.K. officials will propose paying £10 billion a year for three years as part of a transition deal chime with expectations on the EU side.\u000a\u000aTwo EU diplomats said they expected the U.K. to link the Brexit bill to the transition in talks this fall. If the U.K. were to meet its financial obligations under the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework until 2020, the diplomats argued, Brussels could play fair and not make the U.K. pay again as an EEA member to get market access. The Brexit bill could, in this scenario, become the ticket for getting market access under a transitional deal. Norway will have paid \u20ac1.3 billion to the EU between 2014 and 2021, but its gross domestic product (\u20ac313 billion) is much smaller than the U.K.\u2019s (\u20ac2.2 trillion) so the British payments would be much higher.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill\u2019\u201d \u2014 Conservative MP David Jones\u000a\u000aLinking the Brexit bill to EEA membership may suit the U.K., whose negotiators have made clear that it would be \u201cpolitically impossible\u201d for Theresa May to go public with a Brexit bill figure in the tens of billions of euros without having something to show for it.\u000a\u000aGuntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, said an early agreement on an EEA transition \u201cwould take the sting out of the very toxic Brexit bill debate. The discussion can calm down, which could also help advancing in other areas such as negotiating a future trade agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut an EEA transition would not be seen as good value for money by all, and some MPs will want the U.K. to hold out rather than accept that an EFTA/EEA transition is the only option on the table.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe negotiations will obviously require give and take on both sides. We need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill,\u2019\u201d said Conservative MP David Jones, a former Brexit minister who was fired after the election and staunch Brexiteer. \u201cWe want a free-trade agreement that gives the best possible access to the single market.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFurther than that, there will clearly have to be negotiation and I would guess that we are some considerable way off seeing what the final position will be,\u201d Jones said.

aVEU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger says the U.K. must continue to meets its financial obligations to the EU even after leaving the bloc | Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images Günther Oettinger: UK must pay EU until 2020 despite Brexit \u2018Very unlikely\u2019 EU will hand over remainder of promised \u20ac4.3B in aid to Turkey by 2020, commissioner for budget also said.\u000a\u000aBritain will have to continue paying the European Union until 2020 even if it leaves the bloc in 2019, the EU\u2019s budget commissioner reiterated in an interview published Monday in German paper Bild.\u000a\u000aGünther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources, said the U.K. must honor its obligations to fund long-term projects.\u000a\u000a\u201cLondon will have to transfer funds to Brussels at least until 2020,\u201d said Oettinger.\u000a\u000aOettinger said Germany would likely face \u201cmanageable\u201d additional payments in the single-digit billion-euro range to make up for the EU budget black hole left by Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\u000a\u000aOettinger\u2019s comments came as the Telegraph reported the U.K. was willing to pay a \u20ac40 billion Brexit divorce bill. Downing Street denied the reports.\u000a\u000aThe budget commissioner also told Bild it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d the EU would hand over the remainder of a promised \u20ac4.3 billion of EU pre-accession aid to Turkey by the end of 2020.\u000a\u000aThe funds were supposed to \u201cpromote projects that bring Turkey closer to Europe, for example through the training of judges, prosecutors or journalists,\u201d Oettinger said. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the political development in Turkey, I cannot imagine such projects will continue to be promoted.\u201d\u000a\u000aOettinger also discussed the ongoing Dieselgate scandal in Germany. \u201cThe results of the diesel summit must now be implemented quickly,\u201d said the commissioner, referring to last week\u2019s meeting in which Germany\u2019s auto giants pledged to cut harmful emissions by fitting cars with software upgrades.\u000a\u000aIf it isn\u2019t clear within \u201ca few months at the latest\u201d whether the agreed measures are sufficient, carmakers must, if necessary, also refit vehicles with technical modifications to avoid bans, he said. But the commissioner defended diesel fuel.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must not demonize diesel. It is significantly more efficient than a gasoline engine, and it also ejects less carbon dioxide,\u201d Oettinger noted.

aVAs you watch those pictures of houses under assault from Hurricane Isabel, doesn't it make you wonder: Why do people build their homes so close to the water? They must have known a hurricane might do this. Why would they take such a foolish risk?\u000a\u000aCalifornia\u000a\u000aWell, people take the risk, because our government encourages us to take it. I know all about this, because I did it myself.\u000a\u000aIn 1980, I bought some beachfront property on Long Island, N.Y., and built a house there. It was a big investment for me. The down payment took just about all of my savings, and I knew what can happen to people who build on the edges of oceans. But I took the risk because the government made me a promise.\u000a\u000aAn Offer Too Good to Refuse\u000a\u000aThe promise was national flood insurance. It made my house and my neighbors' homes possible. After all, no bank will give you a mortgage unless you have insurance.\u000a\u000aPrivate insurance companies were reluctant to sell insurance to those of us who build on the edges of oceans, and were they to offer it, they'd charge an arm and a leg to cover the risk. But this wasn't a problem for me, because you offered to insure my house. I know you didn't do it personally, but you, as a taxpayer, are the guarantee behind federal flood insurance. Should a big storm wipe out half the coast, you'll cover our losses \u2014 up to a quarter-million dollars. Thanks \u2014 we appreciate it \u2014 but what a dumb policy.\u000a\u000aThe subsidized insurance goes to affluent homeowners on both coasts \u2014 from Malibu Beach, where movie stars live, to Kennebunkport where the Bush family has a vacation home, to Hyannisport, where the Kennedy family has a summer home, to the Hamptons, where I bought my house.\u000a\u000aThe insurance premiums were a bargain. The most I ever paid was a few hundred dollars. Federal actuaries say if the insurance were realistically priced, it would cost thousands of dollars. Why should the government guarantee water's-edge insurance? Why should the government be in this business at all?\u000a\u000aA decade ago I spoke with James Lee Witt, who ran FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for President Clinton. FEMA's current director is busy with this week's hurricane, but his agency's policy hasn't changed much, so let's look again at the discussion I had with Witt.\u000a\u000aWitt told me he thinks the flood insurance saves federal tax dollars. "If this insurance wasn't there, OK, then people would be building in those areas anyway, OK? Then it would cost the American taxpayers more dollars if a disaster hit that community and destroyed it," he said.\u000a\u000aHe said it's cheaper than offering additional disaster relief.\u000a\u000aShould We Subsidize Insurance for Drunk Drivers?\u000a\u000aThat's government logic for you. Since we always spent huge amounts of taxpayer money bailing out people with disaster relief, politicians 35 years ago said, why don't we try to recover some of that money by selling flood insurance?\u000a\u000aAs so often happens, the program had unintended consequences. The cheap insurance encouraged more people to build on the beach, so the insurance risk is now huge. Today, $645 billion in property is guaranteed by Uncle Sam.\u000a\u000aGeologist Orrin Pilkey at Duke University says this policy is simply "stupid." Pilkey has been one of the most persistent critics of the government's policies. He says both disaster relief and federal flood insurance just encourage people to stay in harm's way.\u000a\u000a"We've got to get around this 'sympathy at all costs' for people who are suffering from natural disasters," Pilkey said.\u000a\u000aWitt disagreed. He said, "Should we just walk away and say, 'We're not going to help you'?"\u000a\u000aIf I were a drunken driver who kept wrecking my car, should there be federal car insurance to make sure I have cheap car insurance?\u000a\u000aWashed Away\u000a\u000aWitt pointed out that the government did require me to put my house on stilts. That was a good thing because 16 years ago, most of my beach just washed away. It wasn't even a hurricane, just three days of big surf and suddenly I didn't have waterfront property. I was over the water. Still, the house survived because of the stilts, and what a view I had then.\u000a\u000aUncle Sam didn't even raise my insurance premiums. In fact, he spent millions more of your tax dollars to rebuild my beach. Up and down the coast, the Army Corps of Engineers dumped sand on hundreds of beaches.\u000a\u000aThis seems like a dumb policy too, since a study of replenishment projects found the new sand usually washes away within five years. But the government does it anyway \u2014 and you pay for it.\u000a\u000aI asked Professor Pilkey what he thought of people like me who build houses on beaches? "I think you're a vandal and extremely costly to our society," he said.\u000a\u000aA few years ago, I got a call from a friend. 'Happy New Year,' he said, 'your house is gone.' And it was. During a fairly ordinary storm, the ocean just dug up the sand under the pilings and took the whole house away.\u000a\u000aThere it was the next day on the front page of the newspaper. I'd always wanted to make front page news, but not like this. It was an upsetting loss for me, but financially, I made out fine. National flood insurance paid for the house and its contents. I could rebuild my house, and the government would insure me again \u2014 and again. I didn't rebuild. I'd learned my lesson; I sold what was left of my land. But the outrage is that federal flood insurance exists at all. There is a quarter-million-dollar limit on each payment, and as long as I build my house in accordance with zoning laws and ordinances, there is no limit on how many times the government will pay if a house keeps washing away.\u000a\u000aGive Me a Break.

aVYou\u2019ve road tripped to meet with real Americans in a quest to visit all 50 states. You\u2019ve hired Barack Obama\u2019s pollster along with his first campaign manager to advise your philanthropic fund. You\u2019ve given a flat \u201cno\u201d to the question whether you are planning a run for president, but it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re not thinking about it. And if you are, you have a lot of work to do.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re not the only billionaire looking at Donald Trump and thinking: I\u2019m smarter, I\u2019m richer, I\u2019m more likable, I\u2019m not colluding with Russia. If he can do it, so can I.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut it would be dangerous to assume that America is interested in electing just any ol\u2019 CEO to be commander in chief. Putting aside the fluky nature of his victory sans popular vote, Trump didn\u2019t suddenly emerge from the boardroom. He was in our living rooms for decades, had a well-developed ultraconfident public persona and had long been testing the political waters.\u000a\u000aSo, if you are serious about embarking on the presidential path, here are four things you need to do:\u000a\u000a1. Don\u2019t assume anybody likes you. You begin this quest providing one of the most popular services in the world, used by 2 billion people. But don\u2019t think that means YOU are popular. As a recent poll of a hypothetical 2020 matchup showed you perform worse against Trump\u2014tying him 40-40\u2014compared with established Democratic politicians. Nearly half of Americans don\u2019t have an opinion about you. Of those that do, for slightly more it\u2019s a negative one. That may suggest a need to shed your image of the socially awkward boss trying to look cool in a T-shirt. Or it may reflect the conflicted feelings many people have about Facebook and its effect on privacy, safety and political polarization.\u000a\u000aEven among those 24 percent of Americans with a favorable opinion of you are not clamoring for a presidential run. There is only one #DraftZuck group, Disrupt for America. It has 15 Facebook likes.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no passion behind a Zuckerberg candidacy. At least not yet.\u000a\u000a2. Show you can do more than write checks: Traditional politicians prove their commitment to the public good by passing legislation or administering government programs. As a CEO candidate, you can\u2019t do that. But you need to do something on behalf of the public that exemplifies your values, your leadership ability and your competency.\u000a\u000aBut wait, you say, Trump never did anything like that. Well, maybe not in the traditional sense. However, his \u201cbirther\u201d crusade checked that box. Championing a baseless conspiracy theory, while a racist outrage to many, humiliated Obama, provoked the \u201cliberal\u201d media and proved Trump could troll better than anyone. And in retrospect, that\u2019s the skill conservative voters wanted most.\u000a\u000aThe last big CEO candidate before Trump, independent billionaire Ross Perot, also built a bond with a voter niche well in advance of his 1992 bid. How? By pursuing for decades his own conspiracy theory\u2014that America left behind prisoners of war in Vietnam. He even charged the government with a cover-up during congressional testimony delivered in August of the presidential campaign (after he dropped out in July but before he rejoined in the September).\u000a\u000aBut lest you start to believe only conspiracy-minded CEOs can mount presidential campaigns, Perot also earned political credibility by leading a gubernatorial task force to revamp the Texas education system, and pressuring the state government, successfully, to enact major reform legislation. So there\u2019s a highbrow path available.\u000a\u000aAnd you\u2019re on that path. You\u2019ve launched the philanthropic Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with ambitious long-range goals: \u201cHelping cure, prevent or manage all diseases in our children\u2019s lifetime\u201d and \u201cHelping every child seize opportunities and solve the challenges of a changing world\u201d through advancements in \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese are laudable and important goals. But without any concrete successes before 2020, they will only paint a picture of a rich guy who likes to throw money at problems.\u000a\u000aYou know about that pitfall all too well\u2014having seen your $100 million donation to the Newark, New Jersey, public school system result in the book The Prize, which chronicles how that money got squandered. And the fact that your wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, is doing most of the heavy lifting for the foundation also can feed a perception that you only know how to write checks.\u000a\u000aOne promising project you have is the Primary School\u2014a free preschool that opened in East Palo Alto, California, last year for low-income families that incorporates health care into its curriculum. (Chan, a pediatrician, is the school CEO.) However, while you are planning an expansion into San Francisco, you still aren\u2019t letting reporters visit classrooms. Such opacity won\u2019t fly in a presidential campaign. You not only need good works, your works need to be transparently good.\u000a\u000a3. Own an issue. Mashable\u2019s Jack Morse said, when considering your political prospects, \u201cif his blandly apolitical 50-state tour has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the man is fundamentally incapable of taking any kind of meaningful stand.\u201d That\u2019s fine for being CEO of Facebook, a business that depends on a massive user base and cannot afford to alienate customers on ideological grounds. But running for president in an age of polarization requires taking clear stands and mobilizing devout supporters.\u000a\u000aTrump grabbed on to the immigration issue and never let go. You started FWD.us, in a failed attempt to pass immigration reform under Obama, and seemingly gave up. The group still exists, but you remain behind the scenes.\u000a\u000aNow, immigration is back on the front page, as Trump is proposing a 50 percent cut in the number of legal immigrants America will accept, with an emphasis on skilled, English-speaking workers. FWD.us is opposing the legislation. But your personal Facebook page is silent, when you could be playing a much bigger public role. Since a priority of imported skilled workers is good for Silicon Valley corporations, you would have extra credibility in going against your self-interest, and arguing that a strict emphasis on high-skill labor is economically myopic and antithetical to the American spirit.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ve said your life\u2019s mission is to \u201cconnect the world,\u201d a mantra with great potential as a sharp contrast to the wall-loving Trump. But if immigration is not the specific issue that most motivates you, then figure out what issue related to breaking down global barriers you are passionate about, and act on it.\u000a\u000a4. Take down an opponent. Politics is blood sport. It won\u2019t come easily for you, as you are more accustomed to geeky Facebook live chats. But political neophytes need to show voters they can throw a punch.\u000a\u000aTrump did so with a strategy of sophomoric put-downs, and that\u2019s not your thing. But there is another model from the corporate world for you to emulate: 1940 Republican nominee Wendell Willkie.\u000a\u000aAs president of the utility company Commonwealth & Southern, Willkie engaged in high-profile battles with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over regulation. And he made a huge splash when he jousted with Roosevelt\u2019s top antitrust official, Robert H. Jackson, in a 1938 radio debate heard by 3 million listeners.\u000a\u000aThe program \u201cTown Hall Meeting of the Air\u201d set the debate topic as \u201cHow Can Government and Business Work Together.\u201d Jackson, who came in with a strong reputation as a debater, predictably excoriated big corporations as a scourge. But Willkie\u2019s polish and charm turned the tables, making the New Dealers look small for pillorying CEOs as \u201ceconomic royalists.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs one Willkie biographer recounted: \u201cThe applause of Town Hall amounted to an ovation. Willkie had spoken with dynamic effect, and the audience realized that it had just witnessed the skyrocketing of a man to national fame.\u201d (Jackson, who had his own early buzz for president, saw his political stock fade, though he later made it to the Supreme Court.)\u000a\u000aOf course, there are risks in on-air clashes. Perot permanently ruined his political prospects in 1993 when he debated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Vice President Al Gore on CNN. He had wanted to shift his signature issue from the budget deficit to the trade deficit, but the drubbing Perot took marginalized him and made his second presidential bid a mere historical footnote.\u000a\u000aAs a champion of global connectivity, you have plenty of nationalist targets from which to choose. What Democrat wouldn\u2019t love seeing you take down Rep. Steve King on the subject of immigration? Or challenge a fellow CEO\u2014like the cantankerous, and litigious, coal mogul Bob Murray\u2014on climate change. You\u2019ve indicated you oppose barriers to global trade; a daring move would be a debate with that former CEO presidential candidate, Ross Perot.\u000a\u000aSo pick your issue. Debate a worthy opponent. Prep like hell. And do it with a smile.\u000a\u000aBut if you\u2019re not prepared to \u201ctake any kind of meaningful stand\u201d and fight for it, you can always stick to writing checks.\u000a\u000aBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 There is a black hole at the center of the Brexit negotiations \u2014 hard-liners can kick and scream, but it\u2019s sucking everyone into its gravitational pull. Its name is transition, and its shape is Norway.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. rejoining the European Economic Area from outside the European Union \u2014 the so-called Norway model \u2014 is European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s favorite option for a post-Brexit transitional arrangement.\u000a\u000aIt would allow for a smooth exit with minimum disruption for British business \u2014 by maintaining access to the single market \u2014 and give negotiators precious time to work out the details of a future trading arrangement. In Brussels, it is now seen as the only serious proposal that the European Commission is likely to make when it comes to a transitional deal. Five EU diplomats told POLITCO it would be a reasonable solution to the Brexit transition conundrum.\u000a\u000aTwo senior U.K. government figures, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the EU\u2019s stance on this and in recent weeks a succession of British cabinet ministers have come out in favor of a transition period of up to three years after Brexit.\u000a\u000aWhile none are yet explicitly talking about the EEA model, even Brexiteers like Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove now sing from the same hymn sheet as Brexit doves like Chancellor Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Home Secretary Amber Rudd \u2014 all emphasizing the importance of avoiding a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit for British business.\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled.\u000a\u000aThe opposition Labour Party too, appears to be gravitating toward that position. Its leader Jeremy Corbyn had said that leaving the EU also means leaving the single market (which would preclude EEA membership). But Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, told the Guardian on August 1 that the party would try to force a vote on keeping the country in the single market.\u000a\u000aInexorably, under pressure from British business, political opponents and sheer realpolitik, they are all being pushed toward an EEA transition.\u000a\u000aEFTA door is open\u000a\u000aIn the alphabet soup of variations on the fringes of the European Union, the EEA is the organization with the largest membership. It includes all EU member countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Those three states are also members (along with Switzerland) of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), a regional free-trade area that operates alongside the EU. To rejoin the EEA from outside the EU, Britain would have to join EFTA.\u000a\u000aThe bloc\u2019s spokesman Thorfinnur Omarsson confirmed to POLTICO that their door is open. \u201cWe are open to receiving a U.K. membership application,\u201d he said. EFTA has not had an indication that this is what London wants yet, but if it takes that option, then the U.K\u2019s entry into EFTA \u201cshould not be too complicated,\u201d he added. That\u2019s so long as an application comes relatively early in the negotiation process.\u000a\u000aWhile there is broad consensus in the British Cabinet that some kind of transition is required, some aspects of EFTA/EEA membership would be unappealing to Brexiteers, even temporarily. Steve Baker, a junior minister in the Brexit department who was promoted after the election, said last month that staying in the EEA post Brexit would be like \u201cputting blood in the water\u201d \u2014 indicating the soft Brexiteers can expect a fight.\u000a\u000aOne reason is that EFTA/EEA members are subject to freedom of movement. The British government\u2019s public position is still that freedom of movement will end on March 29, 2019, when the U.K. leaves the EU. But seemingly contradictory statements from Hammond, who has said it will be \u201csome time\u201d before full migration controls can be imposed, and Rudd, who has promised businesses no \u201ccliff edge\u201d on migration, suggest the government is heading toward a compromise.\u000a\u000aOne such escape clause was proposed by former chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee Crispin Blunt immediately after the election in a Times article suggesting an EEA transition. He pointed out that it would be possible to invoke powers held by EEA members to restrict freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aArticle 112 of the EEA Agreement allows a party to the agreement to unilaterally take \u201csafeguard measures\u201d to limit freedom of movement in particular regions or sectors.\u000a\u000aStephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, son of former leader Neil Kinnock and partner of former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said that the clause meant an EEA transition met all three of his party\u2019s manifesto pledges on Brexit: that the U.K. must leave the EU, retain the benefits of the single market and reform freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aThe only legal precedent for invoking it comes from Liechtenstein but, Kinnock said, \u201cif that\u2019s a deal that tiny little Liechtenstein could secure, that\u2019s something we could secure given the diplomatic and economic clout of the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s up to Theresa May and David Davis to deliver,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aKinnock is one of a group of Labour MPs seeking to ally with like-minded Conservative backbenchers to force a vote on staying in the EEA during a transition when the government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill comes to the House of Commons in September.\u000a\u000aOne Labour shadow cabinet member said it was now \u201calmost inevitable\u201d that the transition period would be the EEA model, because there is not enough time between now and the close of negotiations, likely to be in fall 2018, to devise a bespoke transition arrangement. Hammond is reported to have made a similar case to business leaders in recent days, calling for an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d transition arrangement.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Labour shadow cabinet member said EEA membership was not a permanent solution. \u201cIf you have any respect for yourself as a 21st-century global power you can\u2019t become Norway,\u201d the shadow cabinet figure said. One major downside of EEA membership outside of the EU is that you must accept the rules of the single market without having any influence over them. By leaving the EU, Britain will lose its representation in the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, as well as it right to nominate a commissioner.\u000a\u000aBrexit bill link\u000a\u000aThe EFTA/EEA option is no silver bullet to a smooth transition.\u000a\u000aIt does not cover customs arrangements and if trade disruption is to be avoided during a transition, a separate agreement would be needed to maintain or replicate the U.K.\u2019s place in the EU customs union.\u000a\u000aOne U.K. government official, meanwhile, said it would not be straightforward to rejoin the EEA, via EFTA, given the reform of the two organizations\u2019 procedures, and structures required to accommodate such a large new member. However, the official did not rule out transition inside the EEA, or \u201csomething novel, but conceptually similar.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled. Martin Selmayr, Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s head of Cabinet, on Thursday retweeted a Times article making this point with the words: \u201cVery true. Good analysis.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Commission views the transition deal as an issue for phase two of the Brexit negotiations. These can only begin if, in the fall, the European Council is satisfied that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in phase one. This judgment is likely to rest on whether the U.K. has made an acceptable proposal on the so-called Brexit bill \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the EU.\u000a\u000aReports in the British press that U.K. officials will propose paying £10 billion a year for three years as part of a transition deal chime with expectations on the EU side.\u000a\u000aTwo EU diplomats said they expected the U.K. to link the Brexit bill to the transition in talks this fall. If the U.K. were to meet its financial obligations under the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework until 2020, the diplomats argued, Brussels could play fair and not make the U.K. pay again as an EEA member to get market access. The Brexit bill could, in this scenario, become the ticket for getting market access under a transitional deal. Norway will have paid \u20ac1.3 billion to the EU between 2014 and 2021, but its gross domestic product (\u20ac313 billion) is much smaller than the U.K.\u2019s (\u20ac2.2 trillion) so the British payments would be much higher.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill\u2019\u201d \u2014 Conservative MP David Jones\u000a\u000aLinking the Brexit bill to EEA membership may suit the U.K., whose negotiators have made clear that it would be \u201cpolitically impossible\u201d for Theresa May to go public with a Brexit bill figure in the tens of billions of euros without having something to show for it.\u000a\u000aGuntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, said an early agreement on an EEA transition \u201cwould take the sting out of the very toxic Brexit bill debate. The discussion can calm down, which could also help advancing in other areas such as negotiating a future trade agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut an EEA transition would not be seen as good value for money by all, and some MPs will want the U.K. to hold out rather than accept that an EFTA/EEA transition is the only option on the table.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe negotiations will obviously require give and take on both sides. We need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill,\u2019\u201d said Conservative MP David Jones, a former Brexit minister who was fired after the election and staunch Brexiteer. \u201cWe want a free-trade agreement that gives the best possible access to the single market.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFurther than that, there will clearly have to be negotiation and I would guess that we are some considerable way off seeing what the final position will be,\u201d Jones said.

aVCars are stuck in a traffic jam near Munich, Germany | Joerg Koch/AFP via Getty Images Politicians, carmakers fail to put brakes on German diesel debate Carmakers\u2019 plan to cut pollution through software updates alone triggers widespread criticism.\u000a\u000aBERLIN \u2014 The plan was to put the brakes on the great diesel debate. It didn\u2019t work out.\u000a\u000aAcross Germany as well as in Brussels and Vienna, criticism has rained down on a deal announced by three of the country\u2019s powerful auto giants to pay for software updates to cut pollution in more than 5 million diesel cars \u2014 but not to undertake more effective, and much more expensive, changes to hardware.\u000a\u000aThe deal was sealed at a \u201cdiesel summit\u201d between politicians and CEOs of the car companies on Wednesday that Germany\u2019s two main political camps \u2014 which both enjoy close relationships with the car industry \u2014 hoped would take the issue off the agenda ahead of September\u2019s parliamentary election.\u000a\u000aBut the strength of criticism from environmental groups, media commentators and others has forced both conservatives and Social Democrats to issue tough-sounding warnings to the auto giants.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m giving the program that\u2019s been agreed a maximum of three months,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the conservative state premier of Bavaria, where the auto sector employs almost 200,000 people at companies including BMW and Audi, told DPA news agency on Friday.\u000a\u000aHe echoed widespread skepticism over whether the measures announced by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW go far enough and warned that if the carmakers fail to come up with substantial results, bans of diesel cars in inner cities could follow.\u000a\u000aAustrian Transport Minister Jörg Leichtfried issued invitations Friday for his own national diesel summit to try and coax the local branches of Germany\u2019s auto giants to follow up with an offer for his country\u2019s motorists that goes farther than what he called the \u201cmeager\u201d deal reached in Berlin.\u000a\u000aEven one of the big car companies poured cold water on the deal. Ford said it does not believe the software tweak \u201cwill have any material impact on air quality.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe European Commission said it is watching closely to make sure the software fixes offered will cut emissions and that consumers don\u2019t end up footing the bill.\u000a\u000aBrussels-based NGO Transport & Environment said \u201cburning through billions to make old diesel cars less dirty is not the answer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInstead, carmakers should be required to fund more cost-effective, sustainable mobility and clean-air initiatives that can bring down pollution levels quickly,\u201d said Greg Archer, the group\u2019s director for clean vehicles.\u000a\u000aDieselgate damage\u000a\u000aMore than 15 million cars in Germany, a third of all passenger vehicles, run on diesel, and brands such as Volkswagen, BMW and Audi are big exporters with production plants and subsidiaries across Europe.\u000a\u000aFor years, the country\u2019s powerful car lobby promoted diesel as clean technology \u2014 until the Dieselgate scandal two years ago revealed systemic cheating in emission tests by VW, throwing the industry into a crisis.\u000a\u000aWednesday\u2019s deal was widely understood as a triumph for the car industry, allowing the car companies to walk away from the issue while picking up the lowest possible bill.\u000a\u000aSocial Democrat (SPD) leader Martin Schulz, seeking to oust Chancellor Angela Merkel in next month\u2019s election but trailing badly in the polls, was quick to stress in an interview with magazine Der Spiegel Thursday morning that there was a need for further action, calling the summit \u201cobviously just a first step.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said it was \u201ctime to make [the carmakers\u2019] concessions watertight,\u201d and that the \u201cchumminess\u201d between senior politicians and the car industry must stop.\u000a\u000aOn Friday morning, the SPD\u2019s deputy economy minister, Matthias Machnig, added it remains to be seen whether \u201cother technical solutions\u201d \u2014 in other words, hardware changes \u2014 were still necessary on top of the software updates and incentives from the car companies to trade in diesel cars on the road for a decade or more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are talking about what value \u2018Made in Germany\u2019 \u2014 a sign of quality around the world \u2014 has,\u201d Machnig told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.\u000a\u000aThe scandal might nudge the industry and policymakers toward Brussels, with the European Commission keeping up calls for a Europe-wide position on the future of diesel.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s Green Party is trying to capitalize on the issue to boost its faltering election campaign. Earlier this week, it presented a plan for an emissions-free car sector and it is increasingly pushing for the introduction of class action lawsuits so consumers can band together to press claims against the auto industry.\u000a\u000aVolkswagen is already facing consumer action over its emissions cheating, but defended the summit deal as a \u201cdecisive contribution\u201d that will also include millions of euros invested in a fund to cut pollution in urban areas.\u000a\u000aUnlike other politicians, German conservative Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who hosted Wednesday\u2019s summit in Berlin, has been notably silent.\u000a\u000aAhead of the meeting, Dobrindt, from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, had already signaled he would be satisfied with an industry-friendly solution such as the software updates that ended up being announced on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe scandal might nudge the industry and policymakers toward Brussels, with the European Commission keeping up calls for a Europe-wide position on the future of diesel.\u000a\u000aCommissioner for the Internal Market El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska wants countries to communicate on the issue through an obscure working group overseen by her department, according to a letter she sent to EU ministers that sought to encourage politicians and carmakers to follow her lead by raising the specter of diesel bans in city centers.\u000a\u000a\u201cDespite the fact that I am convinced that we should rapidly move towards zero emissions vehicles across Europe, certainly it is not in the interest of political leaders and industry to face a rapid collapse of the European market for diesel vehicles caused by local bans,\u201d Bie\u0144kowska said in the letter, seen by POLITICO.

aVDr. Priscilla Chan, wife of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has been in talks with city and school officials to open a charter or alternative public school in San Francisco for nearly a year, the San Francisco Examiner has learned.\u000a\u000aThe school, modeled after a private school Chan and her husband opened in East Palo Alto last year called The Primary School, would focus on the health and education of at-risk children from before birth through eighth grade and their parents.\u000a\u000aThe school would be the first expansion of The Primary School and mark yet another endeavor into The City for the couple, who donated $75 million to the newly renamed Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe goal of The Primary School has always been to create a holistic system of care for children that can be replicated across the Bay Area and nationally,\u201d a spokesperson for The Primary School said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited The Primary School model is being considered by the San Francisco Unified School District.\u201d\u000a\u000aThrough a public records request, the Examiner obtained emails between The Primary School, city and school officials that detail months of discussion about the project that continued into February.\u000a\u000aChan first inquired about opening a charter school in The City last June. The conversation has since turned into whether to open the school as a charter or Small School by Design.\u000a\u000aCharters offer more flexibility for hiring staff than small schools, which are still governed by school district policy, have low-student enrollment and are focused on student equity.\u000a\u000aBut charters, which have more independence, are not as well received in San Francisco unless they serve particular populations like inmates at County Jail or juvenile offenders.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are at a cross-roads and would like to explore the options of [The Primary School] becoming a Small School by Design within the SFUSD structure, or applying for a jointly designed public charter,\u201d Hydra Mendoza-McDonnell, Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s education advisor, wrote in an email Feb. 2.\u000a\u000aMendoza-McDonnell, who is also vice president of the Board of Education, is supportive of the project and has been leading the conversations since June 2016. At the time, she and then-Superintendent Richard Carranza hoped to have board approval for the school to open as a charter by March 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is also a question about whether you need to be a charter next fall or if we should start with an MOU and convert it into a charter in a couple of years when we actually have students old enough to begin the infant/toddler classroom,\u201d she wrote in June.\u000a\u000aThere was a lull in discussions about The Primary School after Carranza left in September. His permanent replacement, Vincent Matthews, will take the reins next month.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School is meant to help those most likely to fall through the cracks of traditional public school, including recent immigrants, homeless families and teen mothers. Costs for running the school would be split between public funding and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative \u2014 the couple\u2019s philanthropic effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re interested in any approach that might ensure better outcomes for San Francisco\u2019s highest need families and children,\u201d Interim Superintendent Myong Leigh said in an email through a spokesperson.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Primary School model offers something that we aren\u2019t currently doing: starting with when a child is born and providing consistent coordinated services to parents and their children over more than a decade,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is all just exploratory at this time, we haven\u2019t yet gotten into the details with regards to oversight, staffing, finances and location.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith Liu, president and COO of The Primary School, said in an Aug. 21 email that they want the school \u201cto be within walking distance of SFGH but could also look at Bayview/Hunter\u2019s Point or other areas of the city with a concentration of high-need families.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe project could have the potential to compete for space with other priorities the school district has, like building new schools in the Bayview to meet the demand of the development boom or the construction of teacher housing, which both rely on the availability of city- and district-owned property.\u000a\u000aIn an Aug. 23 email, Mendoza-McDonnell said the school will likely need its own campus.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis sounds like a stand-alone space and not a shared space,\u201d Mendoza-McDonnell wrote, adding that she wanted to have further conversation with \u201cThe City\u2019s real estate folks and Office of Economic and Workforce Development for city and private property considerations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe following month, Mendoza-McDonnell said in a Sept. 12 email there were a range of potential sites for the school from \u201csharing a space at Malcolm X Academy in the Bayview,\u201d which is an under-enrolled school, \u201cto a stand-alone site in the Mission just blocks from\u201d SFGH.\u000a\u000aSchool board President Shamann Walton said in an interview Monday he is excited about the potential partnership but would prefer to see it benefit children in the Bayview as a small school rather than a charter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would love for them to infuse their pediatric practices into one of our schools in the southeast sector,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take resources away from the traditional system.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here or scroll down to comment

aVDozens of reporters and a horde of photographers turned out for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 news conference Friday to announce a crackdown on leaks, but the most important target for his message wasn\u2019t in the room: President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019 eight-minute broadside against leaks and his stern warning to leakers seemed to be aimed at trying to repair his badly frayed relationship with Trump, who has expressed regret for selecting Sessions and who has specifically complained that he was doing too little to fight the tidal wave of leaks that have swamped the Trump White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst, let me say that I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect our country,\u201d Sessions declared. \u201cWe are taking a stand. This culture of leaking must stop. \u2026 Cases will be made and leakers will be held accountable.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf Sessions\u2019 desire to address the leaks of most concern to Trump wasn\u2019t sufficiently apparent, the attorney general offered unsolicited outrage toward the leak that roiled the West Wing this week: the publication of transcripts of Trump\u2019s confidential conversations with Mexico\u2019s president and Australia\u2019s prime minister earlier this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust yesterday, we saw media reports about conversations the president had with foreign leaders,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cNo one is entitled to surreptitiously fight to advance battles in the media by revealing sensitive government information.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven Sessions\u2019 thinly veiled threat toward the press seemed intended to curry favor with the occupant of the Oval Office, who regularly castigates the news media on Twitter over \u201cFAKE NEWS.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe respect the important role that the press plays and we will give them respect, but it is not unlimited,\u201d the attorney general warned. \u201cThey cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance the press\u2019s role with protecting national security and the lives of those who serve in the intelligence community and all law-abiding Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000aSessions also got in two digs at another part of the Washington establishment that Trump seems to be sour on at the moment: Congress. The attorney general suggested, without providing specifics, that lawmakers or their aides are responsible for some of the recent leaks.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019 long-distance missive to the president comes as their relationship seems to be settling into a chilly detente.\u000a\u000aInterventions from Sessions\u2019 Senate friends, from his allies in the White House and from conservative leaders appear to have stemmed the near-daily taunts that Trump directed toward his attorney general last month.\u000a\u000aTrump has now gone more than a week without publicly attacking Sessions. Trump\u2019s new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, also called Sessions last weekend with reassurances that his job was safe. (Sessions and Trump were face to face at a Cabinet meeting Monday, but there are no signs the men have sorted out their issues.)\u000a\u000aTrump has calmed down on Sessions, several senior administration officials said, after having conversations with a number of people who arranged to see him and defend the attorney general. The president was also distracted by the other problems in his administration and has talked less about Sessions, one aide said.\u000a\u000aKelly has also told the president that it would be a mistake to cut ties with Sessions, and Trump has told others privately he has no plans to make a change, said one person who spoke with the president last weekend.\u000a\u000aThe public silence from Trump has Sessions\u2019 aides and allies breathing a sigh of relief but it is an uneasy peace, marked by concern that the president\u2019s ire could surface again at any moment. While Trump is no longer publicly mocking his attorney general, the president has offered no public praise for Sessions nor even any acknowledgement of his work to advance the administration\u2019s priorities.\u000a\u000aBut Trump\u2019s anger could be triggered at any point by the ongoing Russia probe, these people said, because he still blames Sessions for those headaches.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they\u2019re going to look into business deals and start looking into his family and this or that, he\u2019s going to blame Sessions,\u201d one adviser said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to associate his problems with Sessions.\u201d\u000a\u000aFriday\u2019s event at Justice Department headquarters was carefully structured to ensure that Sessions\u2019 message reached Trump with the fewest distractions possible. If reporters had the chance to question the attorney general about the Russia investigation, he might have demurred because he has recused from the probe. But with the recusal at the core of Trump\u2019s complaints about Sessions, any televised scene of the attorney general broaching the subject could send the president into a blue rage.\u000a\u000aSo, Sessions filed out after he spoke. Cameras were then shut off at Justice officials\u2019 insistence before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein returned to take reporters\u2019 questions about the nitty-gritty of the leak crackdown.\u000a\u000aOne question the deputy attorney general got: whether Friday\u2019s press event was arranged at the instigation of the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe answer to that is, everybody in the intelligence community recognizes that we\u2019ve been dealing with an increased number of leaks,\u201d Rosenstein said, not answering directly. \u201cSo, I think we\u2019ve heard that from many senior government representatives. We\u2019ve also heard it from congressmen and senators.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked whether the Justice Department was out to \u201cappease\u201d the president, Rosenstein replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that other than to say \u2026 I think it is appropriate for everyone to be concerned.\u201d\u000a\u000aFriday\u2019s public fusillade against leaks is just the latest example of efforts to use the media to let Trump know Sessions and his department are putting their shoulder to the wheel on issues near and dear to the president, like fighting drugs, gangs and illegal immigration. Last week, a top Justice Department official made an unusual appearance in the White House briefing room \u2014 just feet from the Oval Office \u2014 to talk about the battle against the violent gang MS-13.\u000a\u000aOne challenge for Sessions in trying to win the president over on the leaks issue is that Trump gets much of his information through Fox News.\u000a\u000aWhile the network\u2019s pro-defense, national security bent might ordinarily make it an ally in the war on leaks, Sessions\u2019 talk of making more aggressive efforts toward the media could raise hackles at the network.\u000a\u000aFox and many on the right erupted in anger in 2013 after it was disclosed that during a leak investigation the Justice Department obtained a warrant to search Fox reporter James Rosen\u2019s emails \u2014 and that prosecutors got the warrant by branding Rosen as a co-conspirator in an effort to violate federal law.\u000a\u000aWhile Rosen\u2019s source was indicted and ultimately pleaded guilty, Rosen was never charged with a crime. However, the episode was one of two prominent cases that led Obama to promise that reporters would not be jailed for doing their jobs. It also prompted Obama\u2019s attorney general, Eric Holder, to make it harder for prosecutors to subpoena reporters or seek their phone or email records \u2014 tightening the very policies that Sessions is now threatening to loosen again.\u000a\u000aRosen declined to comment on Sessions\u2019 proposal. A Fox News spokeswoman had no immediate response to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aAnother topic that seemed to get little attention Friday was the fact that leak prosecutions broke records during the Obama administration. There were some allusions to the fact that the issue has been one the government has tried to crack down on before.\u000a\u000aSessions noted that an \u201cinsider threat\u201d task force was set up in 2011 to address leaks. \u201cProgress has been made and we intend to reach new levels of effectiveness,\u201d the attorney general said.\u000a\u000aRosenstein did mention that he handled a couple of the cases brought in recent years, including the prosecution of Gen. James \u201cHoss\u201d Cartwright.\u000a\u000aRosenstein acknowledged that the hurdle in getting clearance to proceed with that case was not clearance to probe media communications, but rather the intelligence community\u2019s reluctance to sign off on making details about the case public. (Israel reportedly objected to potential disclosure of its involvement with using the so-called Stuxnet virus against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.)\u000a\u000aCartwright entered a guilty plea last October to a single felony count of lying in the course of the investigation, although prosecutors made clear that they believed he had leaked top secret information to the New York Times and Newsweek.\u000a\u000aIn the off-camera briefing, Rosenstein also passed up a chance to take what could have been an easy shot at Obama. The veteran prosecutor did not note the ultimate outcome of the Cartwright case. Three days before leaving office, Obama granted the Marine general a pardon that wiped out his conviction and eliminated a sentence that could have ranged up to five years in prison.\u000a\u000aJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.

aVBrigitte Macron is unlikely to be put on a par, title-wise, with Melania Trump | Pool photo by Michel Euler/EPA Brigitte Macron: President\u2019s wife, not first lady \u2018Emmanuel Macron has backed down on his position in light of our mobilization these last few days, and we thank him for it,\u2019 says petition organizer.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 Brigitte Macron will not be given the official title of \u201cfirst lady\u201d after an online uproar that roused France from its summer slumber.\u000a\u000aHowever, she will still be widely referred to as the first lady and have access to a small staff to run her office, housed near her husband\u2019s.\u000a\u000aPresident Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push to change his wife\u2019s official status seems to have confused quite a lot of people, including the man who launched the petition that stopped the plan in its tracks.\u000a\u000aNearly 30o,000 people signed the petition set up by artist and activist Thierry Paul Valette, who argued that Brigitte Macron should not be legally recognized as first lady because doing so would give her access to a \u201cbudget\u201d with \u201cpublic funds.\u201d\u000a\u000aValette also said the move would be unfair as the French parliament has backed legislation barring MPs from employing their spouses and relatives \u2014 a direct response to the fake jobs scandal that scuppered conservative François Fillon\u2019s chances of becoming president.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, when the Elysée suggested it would not pursue legislation changing Brigitte Macron\u2019s legal status (and instead would publish a \u201ctransparency charter\u201d with detailed accounts on her activities), Valette took to Facebook to declare a \u201cbeautiful citizens\u2019 victory.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEmmanuel Macron has backed down on his position in light of our mobilization these last few days, and we thank him for it,\u201d wrote Valette.\u000a\u000aThe artist, who campaigned against Macron during the presidential and parliamentary elections, had scored a political point against a president whose approval ratings are in free fall because of budget cuts and controversial reform plans.\u000a\u000aIn doing so he was in step with far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose party criticized Brigitte Macron getting first lady status in parliament last month (despite no legislation on the issue being on the agenda).\u000a\u000aHowever, their main argument against the idea \u2014 that she should not be using taxpayers\u2019 money to pay staff \u2014 seemed to miss the point. Title or no title, Brigitte Macron\u2019s arrangement at the Elysée will be no different than that of every presidential spouse since the time of Valéry Giscard d\u2019Estaing.\u000a\u000aExcept in one important regard: Brigitte Macron will get less money than her predecessor \u2014 François Hollande\u2019s now former partner Valerie Trierweiler \u2014 because of solidarity with budget constraints elsewhere, and her staff resources will be made public for the first time (previously it was wrapped up with the rest of the Elysée\u2019s operating budget).\u000a\u000aMaking the office of the president\u2019s partner more transparent \u2014 and avoiding accusations that she was wasting taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 were precisely the reasons Macron suggested changing her status at the Elysée.\u000a\u000aYet the protesters were not necessarily interested in transparency, they wanted to force the president to back down.\u000a\u000aIn that sense, they have likely succeeded. An Elysée spokesman told POLITICO that a statement to be issued in the coming weeks regarding Brigitte Macron\u2019s status would clarify her role and number of staff, but not dwell on her legal status.\u000a\u000aIn other words, she is unlikely to be put on par, title-wise, with Melania Trump.\u000a\u000aThe former teacher will still be able to run a children\u2019s charity. She just won\u2019t be able to do so in an officially recognized capacity.

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s lengthy planned vacation at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club will test the ingenuity of protesters hoping to disrupt his vacation \u2014 or at least take advantage of his presence to draw attention to their causes.\u000a\u000aPolice say the road and shoulder directly outside the Trump National Golf Club are too narrow for people to safely congregate, forcing sign-bearing protesters to hang out down the road \u2014 and out of earshot \u2014 in a designated \u201cfree speech zone\u201d by the Clarence Dillon Public Library when Trump is in town.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMore creative ideas floated by groups like Indivisible and We the People have had to be tossed \u2014 such as releasing hundreds of orange balloons over the golf course (scrapped because of environmental concerns), spray painting the healthcare vote tally on the road leading up to the entrance (Somerset County fines), or flying a banner over the course (no-fly zone imposed by the Secret Service).\u000a\u000aLocals can still drive past the Bedminster club, so the local chapter of We the People has taken police orders to \u201ckeep moving\u201d literally, forming a motorcade that circles around the lavish course each Saturday, whether Trump is in town or not.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can\u2019t fly things either. I don\u2019t know what else to call it, but [the motorcade] is like one part parade, two parts protest each Saturday.\u201d\u000a\u000aProtesting presidents while they\u2019re on vacation has never been easy. From squeezing onto narrow shoulders in Hawaii to protest President Barack Obama to being cordoned off site to make a statement to President George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas, demonstrators haven\u2019t enjoyed the same latitude given in more traditional venues, including Lafayette Park in front of the White House, where the National Park Service is in charge of issuing protest permits.\u000a\u000aProtesters repeatedly marched over the winter near Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the president spent many weekends after taking office, targeting specific policies like Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order or the decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords.\u000a\u000aAt Bedminster, some activists say they\u2019re driven by more quotidian concerns: the inconveniences that Trump\u2019s weekend getaways create for residents.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Trump should stay in that dump he described in Washington, D.C.\u201d said Peg Schaffer, the chair of the Somerset County Democratic Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s screwing up the traffic in the area.\u201d\u000a\u000aSchaffer \u2014 who has in the past hosted a Democratic Party victory party at Trump\u2019s Bedminster club \u2014 said she also objects to the use of taxpayer dollars to secure Trump Organization properties: \u201cHow many of his properties are the American people supposed to pay for security at?\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

For the president\u2019s vacation, Girvan says he\u2019s organizing more than a hundred cyclists to make loops around the area, which would be only as fast as 10 to 15 miles per hour \u2014 which will slow down traffic.\u000a\u000aThe name for the fresh tactic? The pedal-cade.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a call-out to all liberal cyclists!\u201d said Girvan. He added: \u201cAs long as he\u2019s here, we\u2019ll be here.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVChancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond's confident Brexit talk has softened following a harsh summer for the Tories | Jack Taylor/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight UK\u2019s empty Brexit threats Since the election, tough talking has been replaced with softer language.\u000a\u000aA threat only works if the person on the receiving end believes you have the ability and the desire to carry it out.\u000a\u000aChancellor Philip Hammond appears to have concluded that the Brussels audience for his own threat \u2014 delivered back in January to Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper \u2014 now believes that the United Kingdom has neither.\u000a\u000aIn the heady days of a comfortable (if not generous) House of Commons Tory majority and an opposition in disarray, Hammond said that if the EU gave the U.K. a bad Brexit deal, \u201cwe could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness.\u201d It evoked images of a Singapore-style low regulation, low-tax economy on Europe\u2019s doorstep.\u000a\u000aWhat a difference a few months and a disastrous election campaign have made.\u000a\u000aThe tough talking has been replaced with a far more emollient tone. \u201cI often hear it said that the U.K. is considering participating in unfair competition in regulation and tax,\u201d he told Le Monde, innocently. \u201cThat is neither our plan nor our vision for the future.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would expect us to remain a country with a social, economic and cultural model that is recognizably European,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThe shift was not due to condemnation from Brussels (European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt called it a \u201ccounterproductive negotiating tactic\u201d) but the altered political reality at home.\u000a\u000aThe dream of some Tory Brexiteers of a second Thatcherite big bang to sweep away Brussels-style red tape was quashed by the 40 percent who voted for Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn on June 8.\u000a\u000aAnd the Grenfell Tower disaster, in which more than 80 people died in a social housing tower block fire (the final death toll may not be known for months), has changed the political mood further. Any appetite for the tearing up of red tape dissipated in the wake of the disaster, which appears to have been caused by a catastrophic regulatory failure.\u000a\u000aThe opposition has also landed some punches on Hammond\u2019s Singapore vision. Labour\u2019s position on the EU single market and customs union may be even more confused than that of the government, but Corbyn\u2019s oft repeated claim that the Tory Brexit deal threatens to create a \u201cbargain basement economy\u201d gained traction in the election campaign and spooked his opponents.\u000a\u000aWith public frustration for austerity rising, even Tories are no longer in lock-step behind continuing with government spending cuts.\u000a\u000aRemember the calls from around the Cabinet table for public sector workers to receive a pay rise just weeks ago?\u000a\u000aHammond is the man who has to balance the books. When those demands started to be made, Hammond knew a Singapore Britain was off the table.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2018s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVArnold Schwarzenegger is used to blowing things up: aliens, the T-1000, state budgets.\u000a\u000aNow, the former action hero and ex-California governor is taking on something vastly less cinematic, but no less daunting: redistricting reform.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the movies, you solve this problem very quickly,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cYou go in the room, you break the door down, and you see all these guys mapping out the district lines and all this stuff, fixing the system\u2014you just go blow up the room, burn the maps, throw everyone out the window, and your job is done.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe waited for the laughter, which comes. \u201cBut that\u2019s in the movies.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome days Schwarzenegger, who at 69 still cuts an imposing figure, poses for photos with people who\u2019ve gotten his face tattooed on their arms. Some days, he meets with lawyers and hashes out legal strategy for the Supreme Court case coming in October that could lead to the end of partisan redistricting.\u000a\u000aSome days, those are the same day.\u000a\u000aSchwarzenegger is preparing to throw himself into a public and behind-the-scenes campaign to build momentum around what\u2019s become a defining cause of his post-gubernatorial career. He has a Terminate Gerrymandering Crowdpac that he\u2019s pledged to match dollar-for-dollar. He\u2019ll be appearing at events, meeting with lawyers, having his team jump in to rewrite incomprehensible charts of the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d and other technicalities ahead of Gill v. Whitford, the Wisconsin gerrymandering challenge that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a few hours after he finished speaking, called \u201cthe most important\u201d case of the Supreme Court\u2019s next term at an event at Duke Law School. Redistricting reform advocates think Anthony Kennedy, meanwhile, is looking for a way to be with them, though they\u2019re not sure. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, supports the challenge but isn\u2019t counting on it as central to its own efforts.\u000a\u000aAfter sitting for a short CNN interview, Schwarzenegger was feeling a little cramped. Blowing through the equipment and the TV makeup perched on a chair, he commandeered an empty committee room in the Rayburn building, where most senior House members have their offices.\u000a\u000aHe looked up, impatient for his next interview to get started already. \u201cWhere is your machine?\u201d said the man perhaps most famous for playing a machine from the future. \u201cGo get your machine!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish we could do like John Travolta with Saturday Night Fever, where he starts dancing. He\u2019s disco dancing, and then all of a sudden, within one year, you have a million more discothèques all over the world,\u201d Schwarzenegger told me for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast, once the machine (actually two microphones and a digital recorder) was set up. \u201cYou wish that you could do the same thing with the environmental issues or in the redistricting or good government practice.\u201d\u000a\u000aSchwarzenegger hasn\u2019t been in office for 6 1/2 years, but he\u2019s still self-consciously a post-partisan politician\u2014an ideological chameleon whose skin-changing ways have been compared to Trump\u2019s.\u000a\u000aHe tells the story of how he came to care so deeply about afterschool programs as a Hollywood star in the 1980s: \u201cI learned about issues, and I learned that there is no straight Republican philosophy or Democratic philosophy." His dueling political impulses, he says, are like those movie scenes with a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other, with a Tirolean twist. \u201cSo there\u2019s the Austrian Arnold and the American Arnold. The American Arnold, the Republican, says, \u2018You\u2019ve got to go. Don\u2019t help those kids. The parents should go home and they should do their job,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo then it\u2019s the other Arnold, the Austrian Arnold, that says, \u2018No, no. That's not the way we would do it over there.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey fight all the time. All the time, it\u2019s wild. People think that you argue with other people, but I mostly argue with myself, because I was raised in Austria, so I have that still in my brain, right?\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cAnd in my mind. And then it was recreated over here. That\u2019s why I always say, \u2018Born in Austria, made in America.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here to subscribe for the full episode to hear Schwarzenegger speak on all of this, plus his thoughts on how Hollywood can take on Trump, fears Republicans will lose a generation of young people and how what he saw in the fitness movement informs his sense of the long game in politics.\u000a\u000aSchwarzenegger draws a straight line between the election reforms he oversaw in California\u2014the redistricting commission and the open, top-two \u201cjungle primary\u201d system\u2014and what\u2019s happened since. No better example, he said, than the eight Republicans in Sacramento who voted last week to expand the landmark global warming law he\u2019d originally signed in 2006 with only Democratic support.\u000a\u000aHe has five movies, including the Legend of Conan, at some stage of production, but Schwarzenegger\u2019s committed enough that he flew to Washington to see the California redistricting commission get a Harvard Kennedy School award. For a full two hours on Friday afternoon, surrounded by Hill interns lured by the promise of free sandwiches, he sat in the front row, most of the time trying to look like he was paying attention to a panel discussion that nearly had even the participants nodding off.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s still a little crazy that the man famous for \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not a tumor\u201d was the governor of California for seven years\u2014longer than George W. Bush had the job in Texas.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also a little crazy that he\u2019s gotten used to not knowing whether he\u2019ll wake up in the morning to a new attack from President Donald Trump, whose reality TV show he hosted for one disappointing season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he maybe sees me on the same level, or he feels threatened by that. I could not even tell you,\u201d Schwarzenegger said when I asked him why he seems to get so deeply under Trump\u2019s skin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to support the president, and I wanted to be supportive of him, and then, all of a sudden, he started talking about me at the Prayer Breakfast, about my ratings. Excuse me, right?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe tries to avoid talking about Trump, except when he doesn\u2019t, snapping back at the president on dividing America and cutting afterschool funding, or trolling him on climate change in an off-center iPad selfie video he shot with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris (Schwarzenegger uses only his iPad and makes only FaceTime calls, so anyone he calls gets a screen full of his face). But he also isn\u2019t one of those never-Trumpers making a clean break with the president, whom he still thinks has \u201creally great potential, because I think that people still like him and I think that people want him to do well, especially his constituents.\u201d Trump can win over converts \u201cby just making some adjustments,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFor all their disagreements, he said he won\u2019t let Trump chase him out of the GOP, as happened with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. \u201cRemember, there\u2019s love it and leave or love it and change it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d like to see a third party rise in America but is cautious about pledging support.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would have to see who is involved because a lot of times, you see those independents and those are wacky guys also,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to be careful who you bring to bed with you.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked whether there are any politicians currently in office he respects besides California Governor Jerry Brown, whom he supported on the climate measure, or Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, whom he endorsed for president last year, Schwarzenegger said he doesn\u2019t have anyone to name. But he heaped praise on former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, his frequent partner pushing for action on climate change, laughing that the two of them together looked sort of like a remake of Twins, though \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him that because, otherwise, he feels like he\u2019s the short guy, and Michael Bloomberg doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether it was announcing his run on "The Tonight Show" or fully owning his persona through seven years in office with constant Terminator and \u201cgirly men\u201d references, Schwarzenegger was a groundbreaker in celebrity politics, and it\u2019s not too hard to see the line from the Governator to Trump. Asked about the possibility of Kanye West, Kid Rock and Caitlyn Jenner making good on their threats to run, though, he demurs: \u201cEveryone has their own path. There\u2019s many ways to Rome, as you know.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Schwarzenegger said he\u2019s done running himself. He can\u2019t run for president, though he clearly wishes he could. He can\u2019t run for governor again, \u201cexcept if they would change the Constitution, then I could think about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for the Senate rumors that flare up every few months, he\u2019s not interested. \u201cWhy would I run for Senate?\u201d he said. \u201cTo be one of 100 here? That\u2019s not my style.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVPhilippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images France pledges to improve asylum seekers\u2019 fate, keep economic migrants out New immigration policy will step up fight against \u2018illegal\u2019 immigration, says interior minister.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 France will always remain open to people fleeing \u201cwar and persecution\u201d but will draw the line at migrants entering the country for \u201ceconomic reasons,\u201d French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said in an interview with Journal du Dimanche published Sunday.\u000a\u000aCollomb said that a new immigration law will ensure refugees seeking asylum see their request addressed within six months, while also strengthening the government\u2019s ability to fight \u201cillegal\u201d immigration.\u000a\u000aThe interior minister also vowed to step up the fight against human traffickers who illegally transport migrants across the Mediterranean, but admitted that French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposal to set up \u201chot spots\u201d in Libya is unlikely to see the light of day anytime soon.\u000a\u000aMacron has suggested France set up \u201chot spots\u201d in the war-torn North African country in order to accelerate the process of sorting out who might be entitled to refugee status.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat type of initiative cannot be currently considered in Libya, due to the country\u2019s situation,\u201d Collomb said. Most foreign policy experts had similarly cautioned that the plan wasn\u2019t credible.\u000a\u000aCollomb pledged that the government would try to \u201creconcile efficiency with generosity\u201d in dealing with asylum requests.\u000a\u000aFrance will create 3,500 new accommodation spaces for asylum seekers next year and 4,000 in 2019, taking the country\u2019s global capacity to 88,000 \u2014 double what it was in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe French government has long tried to soothe the concerns of human rights organization by pledging to build a better system to treat asylum requests, while also reassuring voters that it is serious about wanting to clamp down on illegal immigration.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur current standards are not as high as what they should be in France,\u201d Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said as he outlined the government\u2019s plans last month.\u000a\u000aCollomb didn\u2019t specify in his interview with JDD how the government intended to fight illegal immigration, save for a renewed pledge to cooperate with foreign governments to crack down on traffickers.\u000a\u000aThe interior minister also said that about 350 migrants remained in the makeshift camp known as the \u201cjungle\u201d in Calais, in the north of France, where thousands of migrants trying to reach the U.K. lived in precarious conditions until the camp was officially dismantled in October last year.\u000a\u000aThe government intends to build a new refugee center that can accommodate up to 300 people, far from Calais and Dunkirk \u2014 another migrant hub \u2014 in order to relieve the pressure on both towns\u2019 local councils, Collomb said.

aVViewed from Brussels, the U.K. seemed so ill-prepared in the early rounds of Brexit negotiations that some EU countries think it must be a trap.\u000a\u000aWhile the EU\u2019s negotiating team say they are unconcerned and prepared for anything \u2014 and that any disorganization on the London side comes from serious divisions in the British political class \u2014 some EU diplomats are growing alarmed. Trade attachés in particular who know their British colleagues as tough, canny negotiators are suspicious of the seemingly fickle and aimless procrastination from the British government.\u000a\u000aThe Brits\u2019 chaotic early posture in the Brexit talks has left them wondering whether London is pulling some sort of deft ploy \u2014 a strategy of pretending not to have a strategy.\u000a\u000aOn the face of it, that looks unlikely. The inconclusive outcome of the June election and Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s resulting loss of authority muddied London\u2019s stance on Brexit. Cabinet rows over the nature of a post-Brexit transition have played out in public, casting doubt on whether there is a settled government position on key issues such as migration and membership of the customs union.\u000a\u000a\u2018A bluff\u2019\u000a\u000aBut those, by and large, are issues for later in the Brexit talks. The suspicion among some in Brussels is that the lack of clarity at cabinet level is being used as cover during the early negotiating salvos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s tactics: They are playing for time on purpose,\u201d one attaché from a Western EU country said, \u201cunder the pretext of chaos in London.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn September they\u2019re going to swamp us with [position] papers on the fault lines \u2014 exactly the issues where they know we [the EU27 countries] are divided,\u201d he warned.\u000a\u000aHis colleague from a Southern country, asked: \u201cDo they have a strategy? Or are they playing a bluff with the European Union? \u2026 It could be a strategy because the British are always so organized.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat expressed the same skepticism last week: \u201cPeople who say the Brits don\u2019t know what they are doing are wrong,\u201d he told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, \u201cI have lived in Britain, I know the British mentality. A non-prepared British government official simply doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy the end of the year, the tables will have turned\u201d \u2014 a diplomat\u000a\u000aJean-Paul Gauzès, who served as a French MEP from 2004 to 2014 and negotiated frequently with British counterparts as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, said that in his experience, U.K. officials pursued their goals with single-minded determination while keeping others off balance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Brits are pragmatic and very concrete,\u201d Gauzès said, adding: \u201cThe Brits never ask for clarity because the more ambiguous it is, the better it is.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn negotiations on finance directives, Gauzès said: \u201cEverybody would move except the British MEPs who would wait until the end of the process to say: \u2018I will tell you how to say that in proper English.\u2019 Their \u2018proper English\u2019 always meant in favor of British interests.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne EU official said that it was just common sense not to underestimate the British. \u201cHaving seen the movie \u2018Dunkirk\u2018 over the weekend, history might suggest that the British could turn disaster and disorganization around,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aIf the Brits are faking, then among the potential scenarios, officials said, is a stall for time that would leave the EU side feeling pressured to agree to a future trade deal rather than allow a disorderly withdrawal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Ollie Robbins [the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser and chief civil servant in the Brexit department] knows very well what he is doing,\u201d the Western diplomat said. \u201cHe is telling Davis to wait \u2026 By the end of the year, the tables will have turned.\u201d\u000a\u000aContinental fault lines\u000a\u000aAnother strategy that some EU officials fear is an aggressive outreach by the U.K. to corporate executives in the EU27, particularly in countries with businesses that could be hard hit by Brexit. The fear is that the U.K. might win friends with an argument that Brussels has been overly focused on winning the initial negotiating battle over the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill to plug a budget hole, rather than focusing on securing a trade deal that would protect businesses for decades to come.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ll say \u2018we want to talk about trade, but the EU only wants to talk about money,\u201d\u2019 the western diplomat said.\u000a\u000aOthers on the EU side though said that given the clear evidence of real political divisions at the top of the ruling Conservative party in the U.K. such fears were unwarranted, even fantastical.\u000a\u000aA seasoned EU diplomat said that if London had constructed an elaborate ruse to gain the upper hand in Brexit, it had fooled even the British negotiators. If it is indeed a mise en scène, this diplomat said: \u201cIt would be an extremely sophisticated one.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd an EU official directly involved in the Brexit talks dismissed as unjustified \u201cspeculation\u201d the idea that the U.K. is operating a hidden cunning plan. \u201cIt seems to me, based on what I read, there is no clarity on the direction in which they want to move and it\u2019s very difficult to implement a negotiating strategy if you don\u2019t have that clarity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis official did not rule out the possibility that London was preparing some sort of Brexit Trojan horse, but said it seemed highly unlikely. \u201cNobody underestimates the capability of British diplomats. British diplomacy has been admired not only in the EU but globally,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe only ones who know the truth are the Brits themselves. Are they ready or are they trying to dance some very strange ballet that we don\u2019t fully get?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Sitting on our hands\u2019\u000a\u000aIrish Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan summed up the feeling in Brussels when he told Ireland\u2019s RTÉ Radio One Saturday that Britain\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations is beset by \u201cinconsistency and lack of coordination\u201d that \u201cbeggars belief.\u201d Hogan warned that \u201cit seems that the United Kingdom still have to come to terms with their negotiating mandate and this is happening at a time when the clock is ticking.\u201d\u000a\u000aA senior U.K. government official said that any perception of chaos or incompetence was false: \u201cThis idea that we\u2019ve been sitting on our hands for the last year is just bollocks. We have been working extremely hard. What you will start to see over the next couple of months is the government setting out in public what has been happening in private.\u201d\u000a\u000aA second government aide said there would be a number of official position papers published in August before the next round of U.K.-EU negotiations, which are due to take place between August 28 and September 1 in Brussels. The papers will set out the government\u2019s official position on a number of \u201ccore\u201d elements of Brexit, the aide said.\u000a\u000aTom McTague and Maïa de La Baume contributed reporting.

aVThe Trump White House is quietly courting a few dozen House Democrats on tax reform \u2014 eager to avoid the fate of the GOP's straight party-line attempt to jam through a repeal of Obamacare.\u000a\u000aEven as congressional GOP leaders largely embrace a partisan path on taxes, White House officials have been wooing 15 to 20 centrist House Democrats since early summer. The Trump administration is all too aware of congressional Republicans\u2019 struggles to come together on a range of hot-button issues \u2014 from health care to government spending \u2014 and tax reform is littered with political minefields for the party.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSo the president and his staff are opening a line of communication with moderate Democrats in case a Plan B is needed. At a mid-June dinner at the White House with four centrist House Democrats, President Donald Trump expressed interest in a bipartisan package combining tax reform with infrastructure spending, multiple sources said.\u000a\u000aSince then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and top White House staff have huddled with conservative Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d prefer bipartisan support for the tax plan,\u201d Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, said in an interview. \u201cWe still think we can earn the support of [Democrats] on the tax package.\u201d Short acknowledged, however, that Hill Republicans \u201cwill choose the path that they want.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear just last week that Republicans will pursue a partisan bill. The sweeping bipartisan tax overhaul of 1986 is unlikely to be repeated this go-round, McConnell said as he announced plans to use the simple-majority budget reconciliation process to overcome a likely Democratic filibuster.\u000a\u000aMcConnell and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) have argued that Democrats could still get on board, but multiple GOP insiders say the plan for now is to proceed along party lines.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the White House isn't giving up on Democratic buy-in. Short and his staff have kept in touch with Problem Solvers Caucus leaders, including New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the top Democrat in the group who also attended the June meeting with Trump. And White House officials have made a pointed effort to gauge centrists\u2019 priorities for tax reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think there are a lot of practical folks in the House, Senate and the administration who are looking at health care and saying, \u2018That didn\u2019t work. Maybe we should have a backup Plan B \u2014 a coalition of Democrats and Republicans,\u2019\u201d said New York Rep. Tom Reed, the top Republican in the Problem Solvers Caucus.\u000a\u000aMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aSo far, the White House courtship has centered on moderate House Democrats because tax reform will be initiated in the lower chamber. Short said he will begin additional outreach to Senate Democrats soon. In multiple interviews, Blue Dog Democrats sounded eager to work with the White House on a tax bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe door is open, and this should be a bipartisan issue,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.). \u201cI hope they consider us.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore than most other minority members, \u201ccentrist Democrats are more focused on doing what can be done to lower the corporate rates and the rates for [small businesses],\u201d said Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), who is working on a list of Blue Dog tax priorities and red lines that will be made public this fall.\u000a\u000aIn the Senate, three of 48 members of the Democratic caucus declined to endorse a letter outlining their opposition to any bill that would add to the deficit or cut taxes for the top 1 percent of earners. One of those three, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, said he hasn\u2019t heard from the White House recently, but has expressed openness to a tax reform deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018I\u2019m happy to work with you all,'\u201d Manchin said of his discussions with McConnell. But he also warned the Republican leader against racking up more debt, and said using the option-limiting reconciliation maneuver is a mistake.\u000a\u000aAnd other Senate Democrats are hoping that McConnell\u2019s members can dissuade him from using reconciliation to exclude them from the process, a tactic that backfired with Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve heard lots of my Republican colleagues say consistently that, after the health care experience, they\u2019d like to see us try to work bipartisan on tax reform,\u201d Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a fiscally moderate Democrat on the tax-writing Finance panel.\u000a\u000aAsked whether Republicans could win Democratic votes for a tax bill using a fast-track procedure to pass the bill on 51-votes, Warner scoffed: \u201cNo. No.\u201d\u000a\u000aGoing the bipartisan route is hardly a guarantee of success, given the disincentive for leaders on both sides of the aisle to work together ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u000a\u000aRepublicans and Democrats also fundamentally disagree on whose taxes to cut and how any plan would affect the middle class. Republicans prefer reductions for top earners and business owners, which they believe will grow the economy and promote job creation. Democrats, on the other hand, have dubbed that kind of supply-side approach \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d and are more interested in ensuring that wealthier Americans carry a heavier tax burden than the poor and the middle class.\u000a\u000aIn the House, centrist Democrats have asked the White House that any bipartisan tax agreement include an infrastructure package. While Trump and Cohn are said to be receptive to that idea, it's on the back-burner for now. Senior Hill Republicans are wary of pairing the two, and some administration officials worry it's too heavy a lift to clear by year's end.\u000a\u000aEven so, some White House and congressional sources fear that a GOP tax bill could get muddled in the ongoing intra-conference war between conservatives and moderates. Should that happen, Republicans will need to find more votes \u2014 and centrist Democrats could be their only hope for passage.\u000a\u000aRecent precedent gives Republican some cause for optimism that Democrats will get behind tax cuts, even if they resort to reconciliation. President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts passed under reconciliation with Democratic votes in 2001 and 2003, with a dozen Senate Democrats supporting the individual rate reductions and two backing corporate cuts.\u000a\u000aThat's why Senate Republicans like Hatch aren't giving up on red-state Democrats, who are more inclined to work across the aisle. Hatch reminded Democrats last week that \u201cnothing in the rules requires reconciliation to be partisan.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, more administration and Capitol Hill officials are starting to express that sentiment. A repeat of the Bush-era scenario, in which Republicans win the support of just a handful of Democrats, could make all the difference in whether a tax bill becomes law.\u000a\u000aIn the Senate \u2014 the chamber known for more bipartisanship \u2014 talks between the two parties on tax reform have been all but nonexistent so far. McConnell's early embrace of a tax bill that needs 50 rather than 60 votes alienated some moderate Democrats who might have been inclined to engage, such as Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.\u000a\u000aTester, a top target for Republicans in next year's midterms, dismissed McConnell\u2019s claim that Democrats drove him to employ reconciliation as \u201cso much crap.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe did the same thing with health care,\u201d Tester said in an interview. \u201cWe offered to help and he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to run it down your throat.' He\u2019s going to do the same thing with taxes, and it\u2019s bad public policy when you don\u2019t bring people together to have a debate.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVNord Anglia International School Dublin is not even scheduled to open until September 2018, but its slots are already going fast thanks to some of the wealthiest foreigners in the region: American bankers.\u000a\u000aThree U.S. banks operating in London have contacted the school in Ireland about the prospect of enrolling their employees\u2019 children. One bank this month asked for 50 slots \u2014 which go for an average of 20,000 euros, or $23,000, a pop, said project manager David Quigley.\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has left American banks in London scrambling to implement contingency plans to relocate to the Continent so they can continue to serve clients there. Trouble is, many bankers are reluctant to leave what has long been Europe\u2019s uncontested financial capital.\u000a\u000aWhile the Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and EU only began last month, the banks are initiating plans to move thousands of jobs out of London even as they simultaneously fight to preserve the status quo as much as possible in the City of London.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday an official with TheCityUK, a trade group representing U.S. megabanks such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, met with Prime Minister Theresa May to advocate for a business-friendly Brexit. Among the requests: a transition period that would give businesses more time to prepare.\u000a\u000aDublin lacks good primary schools. Paris has stringent labor regulations and taxes. And Frankfurt? Too small and boring.\u000a\u000aBankers are increasingly anxious that Brexit will end badly and force them to carry out their costly relocation plans. \u201cWe are lobbying very hard for an orderly Brexit,\u201d said a London-based banker at an American firm.\u000a\u000aSome 500 U.S.-based financial services firms operate in London. Switzerland is a distant second with one-tenth as many. Of the 222 largest firms with significant operations in Britain, about 27 percent are expecting to move staff out of the U.K or are reviewing their plans, according a report this month by Ernst & Young.\u000a\u000aAt least 22 investment banks have declared their intention to move some staff or operations, with Frankfurt and Dublin tied for first place, followed by Paris.\u000a\u000aJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon visited Dublin and Paris this month. The bank, the biggest in the U.S. by assets, recently bought new offices on Dublin\u2019s River Liffey.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do know other U.S. groups sent in their real estate teams to Dublin,\u201d said Kieran Donoghue, head of international financial services for IDA Ireland, an Irish government agency. \u201cIt is not confined to JPMorgan.\u201d\u000a\u000aIDA\u2019s clients include Bank of New York Mellon, Citi, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, he said.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, Bank of America became the latest big U.S. bank to pick Dublin as the post-Brexit location for some of its employees. The company did not divulge the number of people who might be relocated there and said it will move some employees to other EU locations as well.\u000a\u000aBut while U.S. businesses are listening to the European cities\u2019 sales pitches, most are more interested in staying in London, partly because moving staff is an expensive process.\u000a\u000aAside from the relocation cost, however, some bankers grimace when they talk about the prospect of moving to Europe and rattle off complaints about the City\u2019s suitors: Dublin lacks good primary schools. Paris has stringent labor regulations and taxes. And Frankfurt? Too small and boring.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne banker said to me recently, \u2018There\u2019s only one opera house in Frankfurt,\u2019\u201d said a London-based consultant who is working with financial companies preparing for Brexit moves.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not deterring Citigroup. In an email to staff on Thursday, Citigroup\u2019s head of Europe said the giant U.S. bank will open a second trading hub in Frankfurt. Up to 150 new positions may need to be established in the EU, but London will remain Citi\u2019s regional headquarters, according to the email obtained by POLITICO.\u000a\u000aU.S. companies are assuming that London\u2019s reputation as a financial center will take a hit after Brexit.\u000a\u000aMorgan Stanley is also expected to expand its presence in Frankfurt by about 200 jobs, according to press reports on Wednesday. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.\u000a\u000aParis is fighting for U.S. Brexit business, too.\u000a\u000aIn addition to trumpeting President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposals to ease France\u2019s labor regulations and cut taxes, the city is trying to promote itself as a leading space for financial technology firms such as app developers for banks.\u000a\u000aParis Europlace, a lobbying group for the city whose members include JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, is highlighting a massive new workspace for startups that opened in July called \u201cStation F.\u201d A Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator, Plug and Play, is opening an office there in September, with U.S. FinTech businesses among its clients.\u000a\u000aCharles LaBelle, an associate director of employer engagement at INSEAD, a Fontainebleau-based business school, said students have been asking financial companies about Brexit, but \u201cthe answer is always business-as-usual.\u201d\u000a\u000aRecent INSEAD graduates have gone to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other U.S. firms.\u000a\u000aAnd in what city do they most want to work?\u000a\u000a\u201cLondon is the draw,\u201d LaBelle said. \u201cWhat we hear from students when we survey them coming in, London is always one of the top three destinations where they want to land.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, U.S. companies are assuming that London\u2019s reputation as a financial center will take a hit after Brexit.\u000a\u000aMiles Celic, TheCityUK\u2019s CEO, said his group is going around Europe to plead its case for a favorable Brexit with lawmakers, including one recently with the members of Germany\u2019s legislative finance committee.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is absolutely no sense of complacency,\u201d Celic said.

aVIn 2003, Senator John McCain declared the federal government\u2019s ban on \u201csoft money\u201d\u2014the unlimited cash donors showered on national political parties\u2014a \u201cvictory for the people of America and democracy.\u201d McCain was ecstatic: Legislation he championed to reduce the influence of money in politics had just withstood a Supreme Court challenge. And the Arizona Republican prevailed after enlisting members of both parties in his crusade.\u000a\u000aBut a new Center for Public Integrity analysis of campaign finance data indicates Democrats and Republicans alike are now aggressively trafficking in a new\u2014and perfectly legal\u2014kind of soft money, enabled by a 2014 Supreme Court decision, the latest in a series gutting major parts of McCain\u2019s 2002 law.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe new tactic is also changing political fundamentals.\u000a\u000aIn a fundraising environment that had come to be dominated by super PACs\u2014committees that may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against specific candidates\u2014it\u2019s helping national political parties regain some relevancy after years of declining power. It\u2019s also reviving an era when politicians were able to directly solicit six- and seven-figure checks from donors on behalf of the political parties, raising the specter of corruption and scandals that dogged politicos during the 1990s.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s how this shell game works: Top donors spent the 2016 election cycle legally writing six-figure checks to so-called joint fundraising committees\u2014committees that can dole their contributions out to multiple allies, notably including state political parties. But rather than keep all the cash, the state parties have been quickly steering the money to the national parties, taking advantage of their ability to transfer unlimited cash to their national affiliates.\u000a\u000aThe joint fundraising vehicles aren\u2019t new, but the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision to eliminate some obscure but important campaign contribution limits in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission had the effect of supercharging them. The 2016 election provided a first, full glimpse at what the new legal landscape would mean in reality.\u000a\u000aThe result: Parties are more aggressively and successfully courting a small number of deep-pocketed donors, giving the wealthy another way to exert their ever-growing influence over politics. And the national parties, which had lost their luster as deep-pocketed donors steered their money to other vehicles, are once again flush with burgeoning amounts of cash whose origins can be difficult to divine.\u000a\u000aFoes of McCain\u2019s effort to restrict political giving welcome the changes. But nonpartisan watchdog groups aren\u2019t happy. The situation is \u201ceffectively a form of legalized money laundering and it is something that we\u2019ve seen on both sides,\u201d says Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center.\u000a\u000aWorking the system\u000a\u000aBoth Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took great advantage of this latter-day soft money system as they barreled toward Election Day, the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s review shows.\u000a\u000aWhen, for example, Clinton\u2019s main joint fundraising committee received a contribution, it divvied the money up among Clinton\u2019s campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee and a gaggle of state-level Democratic Party committees.\u000a\u000aState Democratic parties then often shifted the money they received from Clinton\u2019s joint fundraising committee right to the DNC, allowing the national committee to pocket significantly more cash than federal contribution limits would appear to allow.\u000a\u000aRepublicans did the same, an even higher percentage of the time: Republican state parties shifted more than 90 percent of the dollars they received from the Trump Victory committee to the Republican National Committee.\u000a\u000aIn the post-McCutcheon world, this fundraising tactic has vaulted joint fundraising committees out of obscurity and enshrined them as prominent players in federal politics.\u000a\u000aDuring the 2016 election cycle, for example, Clinton\u2019s joint fundraising committee took in over $300 million more than Barack Obama\u2019s did during the 2008 election cycle, when he was the Democratic nominee.\u000a\u000aThe new reality has also pushed national parties to court \u2014 even more assertively than before \u2014 a small cohort of donors who can write them huge checks.\u000a\u000aDuring the 2016 election cycle, at least 1,700 donors each spread $127,000 or more among federal candidates, party committees and political action committees, the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s analysis of campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics found. The $127,000 figure (adjusted to current dollars) is significant because it represents the so-called aggregate cap, or limit on the amount donors could give all federal candidates, political parties and political action committees combined, that was struck down by McCutcheon.\u000a\u000aCombined, that small universe of megadonors injected more than $500 million into federal-level elections in 2016, and slightly more than half of that money was in contributions that would not have been legally permitted before the McCutcheon v. FEC decision, when the aggregate caps were still in place.\u000a\u000aSome donors in previous cycles exceeded the limits, despite the law, but the change has funneled hundreds of millions of additional dollars into federal elections, much of it into party coffers. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, only about $16 million went over the limits.\u000a\u000aThe total includes contributions to new accounts Congress created for the parties in December 2014, after the McCutcheon v. FEC decision. Those accounts can accept six-figure contributions, but the money is earmarked for restricted purposes such as convention costs or recount expenses.\u000a\u000aThe RNC did not respond to requests for comment. The DNC \u201ccomplied with all FEC requirements,\u201d says spokesman Michael Tyler.\u000a\u000aBut in a May 2016 email exchange among top Democratic Party officials and their lawyers, released by WikiLeaks, they acknowledged that any formal agreement between state parties and the national party to transfer the money \u201cwould raise serious legal question for the DNC.\u201d (The email was prompted by media coverage of some transfers.) Instead, the Democrats said, the party should stress there is \u201cdefinitely no formal agreement or obligation\u201d requiring the transfers, even though \u201cin practice\u201d state parties, the DNC and the Clinton campaign would move the money where \u201cit will be the most useful.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow it works\u000a\u000aContributions to Trump\u2019s campaign machine by Julianna Holt, chairwoman of the NBA\u2019s San Antonio Spurs, show how the nation\u2019s new soft money system works \u2014 and how it makes a mockery of campaign finance law.\u000a\u000aHolt wrote checks totaling $499,400 in 2016 to the Trump Victory Committee, Trump\u2019s main joint fundraising committee benefiting his presidential campaign and Republicans writ large. Of Holt\u2019s contribution, Trump\u2019s own campaign received $5,400\u2014the legal maximum for a presidential committee. The RNC, meanwhile, received $284,000, split among its general account and several restricted accounts that fund specific projects, such as national conventions or election recounts. Finally, 20 state Republican parties reported receiving $10,000 each from Holt, via her original contribution to Trump\u2019s joint fundraising committee.\u000a\u000aBut of these 20 state parties, 18 of them held the money only briefly before transferring it to the RNC. The state parties did this by exploiting a law that allows them to transfer unlimited amounts of money to their national party committee cousins.\u000a\u000aIn the end, the transfers from the state parties meant the RNC pulled in an additional $180,000 from Holt. (Holt didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry from the Center for Public Integrity about her contributions and how they were used.)\u000a\u000aHundreds of other Trump Victory Committee donors had their big-dollar donations used in similar fashion. In all, state Republican parties transferred nearly every dollar they received from the Trump Victory Committee to the RNC\u2014more than $27 million from the committee\u2019s formation in May 2016 to the end of that year, according to the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s analysis.\u000a\u000aOne state party chairwoman, Terry Lathan of the Alabama Republican Party, said the RNC made it clear to her that the Trump Victory Fund would be sending her state party committee money\u2014and she knew most of it would go to the RNC.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was perfectly fine,\u201d Lathan said. \u201cWe wanted to be team players to help in a presidential election year.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the Democratic side, donors contributing to the Hillary Victory Fund\u2014and thereby eventually filling the DNC's coffers with bonus cash\u2014included Illinois venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker, media mogul Fred Eychaner and former Dreamworks SKG CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.\u000a\u000aDemocratic state parties pocketed about one-fourth of the money they received from Clinton\u2019s joint fundraising committee. But they sent the other three-fourths\u2014at least $84 million\u2014to the DNC.\u000a\u000aSeth Masket, chairman of the political science department of the University of Denver, notes that political parties have always found innovative ways of adapting their fundraising practices. Often, he says, \u201creforms are designed to kind of limit their ability to transfer around money or spend money on campaigns and usually parties are very skilled at finding new ways at getting that money to candidates who need them in competitive districts.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an unusual move, the Hillary Victory Fund itself spent some proceeds on advertisements designed to boost Clinton\u2019s campaign. This novel use of political money worried watchdogs who said it effectively violated federal campaign contribution limits by shifting Clinton\u2019s own campaign costs onto groups funded by donors writing six- and seven-figure checks. (By law, 2016 presidential campaign committees could accept contributions of up to only $2,700 per election, per person.)\u000a\u000aMore than two dozen Democratic state parties did not respond to a request for comment from the Center for Public Integrity regarding their transfers to the DNC.\u000a\u000a\u2018Like pinball\u2019\u000a\u000aThe 2016 election\u2019s tangled web of soft money transfers makes following political money\u2014often a daunting task even for election lawyers and political reporters\u2014that much more difficult. And that makes it hard for voters to understand what interests are behind the political ads they\u2019re seeing on television, or assess the full influence of a big donor.\u000a\u000aThe dollars given to the joint fundraising committees ricocheted around \u201clike pinball,\u201d says Daniel Weiner, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, which advocates for campaign finance reform.\u000a\u000aBut other campaign finance lawyers noted that the transfers, while confusing, represent fundraising coordination between state and national parties\u2014something that\u2019s perfectly permissible and to be expected during the heat of an election season.\u000a\u000aBesides, as pro-deregulation campaign finance lawyer Jim Bopp notes, the national parties transfer money \u201cto the states that matter\u201d closer to Election Day, and those critical states then use the money locally.\u000a\u000aWhen Congress passed McCain\u2019s 2002 law, it was responding to a public backlash after a series of scandals that showed the growing influence of corporations, labor unions and big donors writing big checks. Now, campaign finance watchdogs say, the pre-2002 system is essentially back as a result of McCutcheon v. FEC, the 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed wealthy Americans to contribute money to as many different federal candidates and political parties as they want. Previously, their overall contributions were capped each election cycle under the \u201caggregate limit\u201d rule.\u000a\u000aThe decision didn\u2019t change the base limits that contributors can give to each candidate or political party, but essentially allows donors to give to more recipients than they could before McCutcheon v. FEC.\u000a\u000aIndividuals had been prohibited from giving more than $48,600 combined to all federal candidates and more than $74,600 combined to all parties and political action committees. That meant that per election cycle, contributors weren\u2019t allowed to give more than $123,200 (though campaign finance data suggest some contributors slipped past that limit).\u000a\u000aCampaign finance watchdogs warned before McCutcheon v. FEC was decided that it would create a loophole allowing donors to circumvent base contribution limits.\u000a\u000aThe amounts of money involved likely will only grow as joint fundraising committees get bigger.\u000a\u000aBut supporters of the aggregate limits said, among other things, that the limits prevented donors from circumventing base campaign contribution limits by giving money to other political committees that then transferred it, or used it to support a particular candidate. The Supreme Court found that argument to be insufficient and struck down the limits.\u000a\u000aChief Justice John Roberts wrote it was \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d to think the resulting river of cash would be funneled to benefit a single candidate. There are enough legal safeguards in place without the aggregate limits, Roberts argued, to ensure that donors don\u2019t violate the base limits. He also said there were strong First Amendment considerations arguing against the aggregate caps, writing, \u201cThe Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat Roberts didn\u2019t predict: The money would flow to the national political parties in amounts not seen since the heyday of soft money, when politicians such as McCain and George W. Bush were fighting over how to address it.\u000a\u000aThere is one key difference between today\u2019s system and the soft-money era, however: Now, the dollars must be used in accordance with federal regulations, as opposed to the nebulous \u201cparty building\u201d activities the old, unlimited soft money contributions could be spent on.\u000a\u000aSupreme disagreement\u000a\u000aIn a blistering dissent that he read from the bench, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Roberts and the majority were making the wrong decision in McCutcheon v. FEC.\u000a\u000aThe McCutcheon v. FEC ruling \u201ccreates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate\u2019s campaign,\u201d he wrote, adding that it \u201ceviscerates our Nation\u2019s campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, campaign finance watchdogs say, events have proven Roberts wrong and Breyer right.\u000a\u000aEven though the transfers are legal, the practice \u201cdrastically undermines the contribution limits, and opens the door wide for corruption to flow from deep-pocketed donors who can write huge checks to the party committees,\u201d says Paul S. Ryan, vice president of Common Cause and formerly of the Campaign Legal Center.\u000a\u000aThe joint fundraising committees will only grow in size in coming election cycles, as more state party committees join up, observers on both sides of the debate agree. Even though they don\u2019t get to keep the money, the state parties have little incentive not to boost the national parties\u2019 efforts. \u201cThe donors are not coming from the state party base,\u201d Ryan points out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost them anything, it gains them favor and it helps their party.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Bopp, a campaign finance lawyer who was part of the legal team involved in bringing the McCutcheon case, says the scenario taking place appears materially different than the one referenced in the McCutcheon v. FEC ruling. That\u2019s because the cash is flowing to national parties, not a candidate.\u000a\u000aThe point of campaign limits is to avoid corruption, he says, and parties aren\u2019t public officials. \u201cWhat is different is a particular donor can give to more state parties than those they were limited to in the past,\u201d he says, which was \u201cthe whole purpose and point of the case.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are some upsides to this brave new money era, political scientists allow\u2014notably the rebuilding of political parties that had atrophied under the old rules. Parties, says Masket, exert \u201ckind of a moderating influence on the system in that they channel most of their funds to the more centrist candidates in the more competitive district,\u201d isolating extremists. Nonetheless, he says, the convoluted path traveled by the money \u201cmeans declining accountability in the campaign finance system, which is problematic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t like these kinds of politics, where money is just circulating in these circuitous ways,\u201d adds Ray La Raja, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\u000a\u000aPolitical operatives see the issue in more practical terms. Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that overturned the limits, says his primary motivation was allowing individual donors to give to as many candidates and political committees as they chose. But if the decision in the case that bears his name helps the political parties raise more money and compete with the super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts, he\u2019s happy about that. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing in my opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cA million in the parties is worth a billion in the super PACs. The people in the parties \u2026 know how to get a lot more out of their money than some of these super PACs.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarrie Levine is a reporter at the Center for Public Integrity.

aVFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharply opposed some of the ideas being promoted by top Republican presidential contenders Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz.\u000a\u000aWithout naming the top two GOP candidates, Zuckerberg blasted the ideas of building a wall, keeping out immigrants, and blocking global trade. Speaking at Facebook's F8 developer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg spent the first 10 minutes of his keynote talk addressing politics instead of programming.\u000a\u000a"I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others, for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and, in some cases around the world, even cutting access to the internet," said Zuckerberg.\u000a\u000aGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\u000a\u000a"You have to be optimistic to think that you can change the world," he continued.\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly said that if elected, he would construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and get Mexico to pay for it. Trump has also proposed imposing stiff tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico. Both Trump and Cruz have pledged to crack down on immigration and deport people already in the United States.\u000a\u000aFor more from Facebook F8, watch :\u000a\u000a"Our lives are connected and whether we're welcoming refugees fleeing wars or an immigrant seeking a new opportunity, whether we're coming together to fight global disease like Ebola or to address climate change, I hope that we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together, not push people apart, to connect more, not less." Zuckerberg concluded. "We are one global community."

aVPolice forensic officers work on the road in between Borough Market and London Bridge in London on June 4 as police continue their investigations following the June 3 terror attack. | Getty Trump fires away on Twitter after London attack On Sunday, he tweeted: 'We must stop being politically correct.'\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump on Sunday called for an end to political correctness, suggesting that terrorism \u201cwill only get worse\u201d if the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cget smart\u201d and reinstate his administration\u2019s travel ban.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\u2019t get smart it will only get worse,\u201d the president warned in a tweet Sunday morning.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s initial response to Saturday\u2019s terror attack in London \u2014 which claimed seven lives, left dozens more hospitalized and ended with police shooting dead three attackers \u2014 urged the courts to reinstate the travel ban.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d the president wrote Saturday night, minutes before assuring London and the United Kingdom that the U.S. will do whatever it can to assist in wake of the attack.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, though, the president took a different tack, stoking fears from his personal Twitter account while also criticizing London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, and noting \u201cwe are not having a gun debate right now \u2026 because they used knives and a truck!\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthorities said a white van mounted the pavement on the London Bridge on Saturday night, hitting a number of pedestrians. The van later drove to Borough Market, a venue with many bars and restaurants on the south side of the river Thames and very close to London Bridge. The attackers jumped out of the van and stabbed a number of people but were shot dead by police within eight minutes of the first emergency call.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

There can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists, and I\u2019m quite clear that we will never let them win, nor will we allow them to cower our city of Londoners,\u201d Khan said.\u000a\u000aHe added that Londoners will see an increased police presence over the next few days but said there\u2019s no reason to be alarmed by that.\u000a\u000aTrump, who drew criticism for promoting a Drudge Report tweet that NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d refused to share because \u201cthe info is unconfirmed,\u201d mischaracterized Khan\u2019s remark Sunday.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d Trump said. His social media director, Dan Scavino, urged Khan to \u201cWAKE UP!!!!\u201d\u000a\u000aKhan criticized Trump during the U.S. presidential campaign, tweeting in May 2016 that his \u201cignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe\u201d and \u201crisks alienating mainstream Muslims.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater Sunday, Trump spoke at Ford's Theatre in Washington. He offered "unwavering support" to the British while reiterating his determination to put an end to such attacks. "We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life," the president said, according to pool reports.\u000a\u000aDuring 2015-16, candidate Trump proposed a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d but his administration has maintained that its executive order is not a ban on Muslims entering the country but rather a national security directive to keep Americans safe.\u000a\u000aAfter a rampage at a casino in Manila, Philippines, early Friday, Trump labeled it a terrorist attack. But authorities said the incident was likely a robbery attempt.\u000a\u000aTrump has often tweeted following terrorist attacks. In April, the president wrote that a shooting on Paris\u2019 Champs Elysées \u201cwill have a big effect on presidential election.\u201d Authorities said the attack was \u201clikely terrorist-related.\u201d And following an attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, Trump called the attacker an \u201cevil loser\u201d during remarks while he was overseas in Bethlehem.\u000a\u000aTrump has asked the Supreme Court to revive his complex and controversial travel ban executive order, which has been repeatedly blocked by lower courts \u2014 even after the administration introduced a revised order in March.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to temporarily lift injunctions barring officials from carrying out Trump\u2019s directive to suspend visa issuance to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries and halt the flow of refugees to the U.S. from across the globe. The high court could review the legality of the travel ban this fall.\u000a\u000aRepublicans in Congress, however, are skeptical about the fate of the ban. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that she disagrees with the president\u2019s view that the travel ban needs to be enacted now.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the travel ban is too broad, and that is why it has been rejected by the courts,\u201d she told "Face the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cThe president is right, however, that we need to do a better job of vetting individuals who are coming from war-torn countries into our nation, but I do believe that the very broad ban that he has proposed is not the right way to go.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d whether the Supreme Court would reinstate Trump\u2019s travel ban, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) couldn\u2019t say.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know what the court will decide,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May by phone on Saturday, according to a readout from the White House, which said the president \u201coffered his condolences\u201d and \u201cpraised the heroic response of police and other first responders.\u201d\u000a\u000aMay said Saturday that the attack was being treated as a \u201cpotential act of terrorism,\u201d which she confirmed on Sunday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face as terrorism breeds terrorism, and perpetrators are inspired to attack not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training \u2014 and not even as lone attackers radicalized online \u2014 but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack,\u201d May said. \u201cWe cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are.\u201d\u000a\u000aJeremy Corbyn, head of the opposition Labour Party, refrained from campaigning for this week's election for part of the day, but came out swinging in the evening. He accused May and her government of trying to protect Britain "on the cheap."\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot protect the public on the cheap," Corbyn said Sunday. "The police and security services must get the resources they need not 20,000 police cutsI"\u000a\u000aThe Anne Frank Center, a nonprofit that focuses on civil and human rights activism, condemned Trump\u2019s first response Saturday, tweeting \u201cSHAME ON YOU \u2026 for dedicating your first Tweet after tonight's #LondonBridge attack to your immoral #MuslimBan.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTerrorism includes violence that destroys people, as well as prejudice that destroys people's souls.

aVFrench President Emmanuel Macron | Robert Hradil/Getty Images Euro-press review Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s CEO French president\u2019s leadership style, Podemos\u2019 profitability and Google complaints on the front pages of the European press.\u000a\u000aGermany\u000a\u000aThe fallout from the Dieselgate scandal continues to dominate German newspapers\u2019 front pages. Die Welt led with the news the premier of Germany\u2019s Lower Saxony region, Stephan Weil, denied allegations his close relationship with Volkswagen led him to soften a speech critical of the carmaker at VW\u2019s request. While Weil rejected the report, FAZ wrote the case has effectively triggered campaigning in the region for the September 24 federal election. The Greens, who supported Weil\u2019s election as premier in 2013, said the cozy relationship between politicians and the car industry have damaged Germany\u2019s reputation.\u000a\u000aFAZ also reported on deportations of refugees from Germany to Greece. A number of asylum seekers will be sent back under Dublin rules, which state people arriving in Europe have to claim asylum in the country in which they arrive.\u000a\u000aUK\u000a\u000aThe Guardian\u2019s front page featured a report on Google apologizing for a memo written by one of its employees, who argued the reason the tech giant has more male than female engineers is because men are better suited for the job. Google said the manifesto did not represent the company\u2019s views. The paper also featured a story on an \u201cIVF postcode lottery,\u201d citing Fertility Network U.K. figures, which indicated areas of England have restricted or halted IVF treatment this year for women struggling to conceive, and others are considering taking similar steps to cut costs.\u000a\u000aThe Times on its front page reported on the trial of convicted terrorists Tahir Aziz, Naweed Ali, Mohibur Rahman and Khobaib Hussain, who shared scores of extremist videos hosted by YouTube that featured Islamist propaganda. The revelations came amidst increasing pressure on technology companies over the accessibility of extremist content. The men were jailed for life last week.\u000a\u000aThe paper also featured a report on record levels of violence and abuse against patients at British mental health trusts. The incidents were reported last year, prompting accusations of \u201cendemic\u201d use of force in the National Health Service. More than 5,000 serious incidents were investigated, including hundreds of suicides, dozens of killings and more than 2,000 cases of self-harm.\u000a\u000aFrance\u000a\u000aLe Figaro\u2019s front page focused on President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s leadership style. Macron manages his cabinet as if it were a company, the paper noted, requiring total availability from his ministers and messaging them about policies in the middle of the night. The paper\u2019s other front page story focuses on the rising euro, which has gained nearly 10 cents against the dollar in three months. That has weakened less competitive economies in Europe such as France, the paper claimed.\u000a\u000aLibération on its front page features a story on the Young Socialist Movement\u2019s loss of trust in the Socialist Party (PS). If there was an internal vote, about \u201c40 percent of its young members would leave the PS,\u201d the paper claimed, citing internal documents. The party lacks a strategy after recent electoral defeats in the presidential and legislative elections, and young socialists aren\u2019t involved in rebuilding it, according to the report.\u000a\u000aSpain\u000a\u000aEl Mundo\u2019s top story focuses on the money-making Podemos. The left-wing party made \u20ac11.6 million profit in 2016, despite contesting national and regional elections. Podemos\u2019 budget surplus was just \u20ac2.2 million in 2015. Compared to established parties \u2014 the conservative Popular Party, the social-democratic Socialist Party, and the liberal Ciudadanos \u2014 Podemos made the most bank.\u000a\u000aEl Pais reported the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party will request on August 16 a parliamentary investigation committee look into reforming the country\u2019s constitution when the Catalan parliament resumes. The debate starts just two months before a Catalan independence referendum on October 1. The committee will be tasked with considering reforms of the country\u2019s current territorial model.

aVJohn Oliver -- and a giant squirrel -- made the king of coal seriously angry.\u000a\u000aRobert Murray, the CEO of one of America's largest coal companies, filed a defamation lawsuit against Oliver on Wednesday. The lawsuit claims the HBO comedian executed a "meticulously planned" and "ruthless character assassination" designed to boost TV ratings and hurt his mining company.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit named Oliver, the show's production company, his senior news producer Charles Wilson, HBO and Time Warner (TWX) (which owns CNN). The complaint alleges that Oliver's "Last Week Tonight" episode on Sunday "incited" viewers to "do harm to Mr. Murray and his companies." It also claims the miner's website was hacked as a result of the segment, and that Oliver's statements constitute "false light invasion of privacy" and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u000a\u000aDuring his June 18 show, Oliver lambasted President Trump over his promises to bring back thousands of coal mining jobs, a pledge the comedian says is a false promise to an industry that's been in a steep decline for decades.\u000a\u000aThe segment, which has been viewed 4.5 million times on YouTube, devoted several minutes to Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, and a vocal champion of the coal industry. Oliver told the audience that Murray had warned him he would sue and bring the case all the way to the Supreme Court if he failed to "cease and desist" any effort to "defame, harass, or otherwise injure Mr. Murray or Murray Energy."\u000a\u000aOliver said on air that he would "proceed with caution," and then he launched into a monologue comparing the 77-year-old coal exec to a "geriatric Dr. Evil." The segment chronicled Murray's career in mining and his handling of a 2007 mine collapse in Utah that left six miners and three rescuers dead.\u000a\u000a"An honest conversation about coal and its miners needs to be had," Oliver said, "and we should neither cease nor desist from having it."\u000a\u000aBut the complaint alleges that Oliver and the show "intentionally, falsely, and outrageously" suggested that Murray had no evidence to support statements that the mine collapse was caused by an earthquake. The lawsuit claims Oliver ignored studies supporting Murray and quoted others out of context.\u000a\u000aRelated: Coal king: It's 'wonderful' Trump ditched Paris deal\u000a\u000aOliver later recounted a story -- that Murray has denied happened -- that the CEO told workers the idea for starting a mine company came to him from a squirrel.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the show, the HBO host trotted a man dressed in a giant squirrel costume onto stage to address Murray directly. "Bob, I just wanted to say if you plan on suing, I do not have a billion dollars, but I do have a check for three acorns and 18 cents," the squirrel said.\u000a\u000a"It's made out to 'Eat sh*t Bob!," the squirrel said, while holding up a giant fake check with "kiss my ass!" scrawled in the memo field.\u000a\u000aOliver acknowledged during the show that Murray is "probably going to sue me." He added, "You know what? I stand by everything I said."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, HBO said: "We have confidence in the staff of Last Week Tonight and do not believe anything in the show this week violated Mr. Murray's or Murray Energy's rights."\u000a\u000aRelated: Coal country's message to Trump: We want jobs of the future\u000a\u000aMurray Energy's complaint referred to Oliver, who is British, as a "foreign national residing in New York." The company, in a separate statement, called Murray a "patriotic American."\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit also described Murray as seriously ill, saying he depends on an oxygen tank, needs a lung transplant and "does not expect to live to see the end of this case."\u000a\u000a"Nothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack," the complaint said, adding it has caused "significant emotional and physical distress."\u000a\u000aMurray Energy said that after the Oliver show, its website was attacked three different times by hackers who attempted to crash it. On the third attempt, Murray Energy said it had to take down its website to implement new security measures.\u000a\u000aMurray Energy also said it received "numerous harassing telephone calls," including from callers who simply said: "Eat Sh*t, Bob."\u000a\u000aThe coal magnate has spoken out publicly to criticize environmental restrictions on the coal industry and has described former President Barack Obama's agenda as "evil."\u000a\u000aMurray also filed a libel suit against the New York Times earlier this year for statements it made about the Utah mine collapse. The Times said it has moved to dismiss the suit.

aVPPP's newest national poll continues to find that health care is a mine field for the GOP, while most Trump voters are just choosing not to acknowledge the Russia story.\u000a\u000aOnly 20% of voters support the health care bill that was being considered by Congress until last night, to 57% who are opposed to it. Even among Republicans there's only very narrow support for it- 35% in favor, 34% opposed, and 31% not sure. Democrats (10/72) and independents (17/61) are each strongly opposed to it. 58% of voters say they want Congress to keep the Affordable Care Act in place and make changes to it as necessary, to just 35% who think the best path forward is repealing the ACA and starting over.\u000a\u000aHealth care could have big electoral implications in 2018. 53% of voters said they were less likely to vote for a member of Congress if they supported the health care bill being considered, to only 21% who said they'd be more likely to support a member who voted yes. One thing that's particularly notable is the division even within the Republican base on that front. Only 36% of GOP voters would be more likely to support a member of Congress if they voted for that health care bill, to 32% who would be less likely to. That suggests bucking the party on health care isn't the kind of thing that's so unpopular it would have much chance of leading to a successful primary challenge from the right.\u000a\u000aThe current political climate is already looking dicey for Republicans as the 2018 midterms loom. Democrats have a 50/40 lead on the generic Congressional ballot. Much gets made of Donald Trump's unpopularity and certainly it's true voters don't care for him- only 41% approve of the job he's doing to 55% who disapprove. But Trump comes out looking positively popular compared to Paul Ryan (24/57 approval) and Mitch McConnell (18/58). Congress overall has an 11% approval rating, to 75% of voters who disapprove of it. Democrats should have the opportunity next year to turn them into bogeymen much as Republicans have with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in recent years.\u000a\u000aHealth care is turning a lot more Republican leaning voters against their own party's leadership than Russia is. On Russia related issues we find a certain degree of willful ignorance among Trump voters that can possibly best be summarized by this finding: only 45% of Trump voters believe Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with Russians about information that might be harmful to Hillary Clinton...even though Trump Jr. admitted it. 32% say the meeting didn't happen and 24% say they're not sure.\u000a\u000aThat finding is in keeping with the general attitude of Trump voters toward the Russia story which is 'don't know, don't care':\u000a\u000a-72% of Trump voters consider the Russia story overall to be 'fake news,' only 14% disagree.\u000a\u000a-Only 24% of Trump voters even want an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, 64% are opposed to an investigation.\u000a\u000a-Even if there was an investigation, and it found that the Trump campaign did collude with Russia to aid his campaign, 77% of his supporters think he should still stay in office to just 16% who believe he should resign.\u000a\u000a-Only 26% of Trump voters admit that Russia wanted Trump to win the election, 44% claim Russia wanted Hillary Clinton to win, and 31% say they're not sure one way or the other.\u000a\u000a-Just 13% of Trump voters believe that members of Trump's campaign team did work with the Russians to help his campaign, to 81% who say they didn't. On a related note only 9% believe that either Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner engaged in illegal activity to help Trump get elected, to 77% who say Kushner didn't and 79% who say Trump Jr. didn't.\u000a\u000aNone of that is to say Trump's overall position isn't bad. Only 41% of voters approve of the job he's doing, to 55% who disapprove. Just 37% of voters consider Trump to be honest, to 57% who say he isn't. And 52% outright call him a liar, with only 40% disagreeing with that characterization.\u000a\u000aTrump does a lot of losing in our poll. Voters wish that either Barack Obama (53/40) or Hillary Clinton (49/42) was President instead of Trump. Trump loses by wide margins in hypothetical matches against Joe Biden (54/39) or Bernie Sanders (52/39) for reelection. Trump loses 12-13% of the folks who voted for him last fall to either Biden or Sanders. Trump also trails in hypothetical contests against Elizabeth Warren (49/42), Cory Booker (45/40), and Kamala Harris (41/40). The one Democrat Trump manages a tie against is Mark Zuckerberg, at 40/40. Zuckerberg is actually not a particularly well known figure nationally- 47% of voters say they have no opinion about him to 24% with a positive one and 29% with a negative one.

aVMen work in the shipyard Fincantieri of Riva Trigoso on January 4, 2017 in Sestri Levante, northern Italy | Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images Italy, France set September deadline in shipyard dispute Rome \u2018deeply regrets\u2019 French decision to nationalize shipbuilder rather than let Italian company take control.\u000a\u000aItaly and France agreed Tuesday to try to resolve their dispute over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s nationalization of a French shipyard when the two countries\u2019 leaders meet next month.\u000a\u000aUnder Macron\u2019s predecessor, François Hollande, Paris agreed that Italian company Fincantieri would buy a two-thirds holding in the STX yard in Saint-Nazaire for \u20ac79.5 million. But Macron\u2019s government chose to nationalize the shipyard for what it said was a temporary period and offered a 50-50 deal, which the Italians rejected.\u000a\u000aFrench Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire traveled to Rome Tuesday to try to mend fences with the Italian government. But the best the two sides could do was to kick the issue down the road to a summit between Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on September 27.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was decided that there will be time from now until September 27 \u2026 to evaluate the chance to overcome these differences,\u201d Italian Treasury Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said after meeting Le Maire.\u000a\u000aIn a joint statement, Italy expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d at the French decision. The two sides also voiced \u201ctheir wish of facilitating the creation of a more efficient and competitive European shipbuilding industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the period leading up to the summit, the two countries said, France \u201ccommits not to open the capital of STX France to any third party and to consider Fincantieri as its preferred option for the future of the company.\u201d\u000a\u000aItaly has long complained that the EU\u2019s free movement of capital rules have worked to the benefit of France and the detriment of Italy. In the last few years, big French companies have acquired control or significant stakes in several of their Italian competitors, whereas the opposite \u2014 so Rome claims, denouncing French \u201cprotectionism\u201d \u2014 hasn\u2019t been the case.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s move to nationalize the shipyard came just a few days after he had also angered Italy by trying to broker a peace deal between warring factions in Libya, a former Italian colony in which Rome has continued to play a leading diplomatic role.

aVPoliticians are a petty lot. If good old-fashioned diplomacy (or war) doesn\u2019t work, one tactic pretty much guaranteed to annoy a rival country is to rename the street on which their embassy sits in honor of someone they don\u2019t like \u2014 then sit back and watch them send out official correspondence on letterheads bearing the offending name.\u000a\u000aSuch a spat is happening right now in the U.S.\u000a\u000aSenior Chinese politicians are seemingly terrified that the street in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington could be renamed \u201cLiu Xiaobo Plaza,\u201d in honor of the activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in July.\u000a\u000aBeijing takes the threat so seriously that, according to the Washington Post, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi raised the issue with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The former was even said to have called for a presidential veto if Congress approves the name change (because if you\u2019re looking for diplomatic tact, Donald Trump\u2019s clearly the go-to guy).\u000a\u000aThe bill that could lead to the name change was put forward by failed Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, who said: \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it\u2019s got their attention. I\u2019ll be even more glad when they change their conduct and stop being gross human-rights abusers.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe response from Chinese citizens, according to the broadcaster Phoenix News, is to change the name of the street on which the U.S. Embassy in Beijing sits to \u201cSnowden Street\u201d after NSA whistleblower Edward, according to translation from Chinese by Quartz Media.\u000a\u000aThe issue of renaming streets isn\u2019t confined to Embassy Row. Throughout Eastern Europe, street signs have been changed to rid them of connections to communism.\u000a\u000aIn Madrid, Plaza Margaret Thatcher has been controversial since the name was adopted in 2014. The decision to honor the former British prime minister was taken while Ana Botella was mayor of the Spanish capital. Botella is married to José María Aznar, former prime minister, and Plaza Margaret Thatcher is a short stroll from the headquarters of his conservative People\u2019s Party.\u000a\u000aThe signs were vandalized repeatedly in the few first months, and when leftist Manuela Carmena took over from Botella as mayor in 2015, she promised to change the name.\u000a\u000aThat hasn\u2019t happened. Carmena is instead focusing her attention on streets with connections to former dictator Francisco Franco.\u000a\u000aA brief history of being petty\u000a\u000aProposing to rechristen diplomatic addresses isn\u2019t just a joke (well, not always), and it dates back at least to the Cold War. In 1984, a bill was put forward to change the address of the then-Soviet Embassy on 16th Street in Washington to \u201c1 Andrei Sakharov Plaza,\u201d in honor of the Russian dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was then in internal exile.\u000a\u000aThe Americans are still at it. In 2015, legislation was introduced that would have changed the name of the stretch of Wisconsin Avenue in front of the Russian Embassy in Washington to \u201cBoris Nemtsov Plaza\u201d and change the embassy\u2019s address to \u201c1 Boris Nemtsov Plaza.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe creation of \u2018Boris Nemtsov Plaza\u2019 would permanently remind Putin\u2019s regime and the Russian people that these dissidents\u2019 voices live on, and that defenders of liberty will not be silenced,\u201d Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the time in a statement, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWhether it is looking at a street sign or thousands of pieces of correspondence addressed \u20181 Boris Nemtsov Plaza,\u2019 it will be abundantly clear to the Kremlin that the intimidation and murder of opposition figures does not go unnoticed.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt cuts both ways, of course. In the late 1990s, a Manhattan street corner opposite Nigeria\u2019s Mission to the United Nations was renamed as \u201cKudirat Abiola Corner\u201d after the wife of Moshood Abiola, who appeared to have won the 1993 presidential election before being arrested by the dictator Sani Abacha. Two weeks later, the street in front of the U.S. Embassy in Lagos was renamed after Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\u000a\u000aThe Iranians are also fans of the tactic. They want to rename the Tehran thoroughfare on which the Saudi Arabian Embassy stands as \u201cSheikh Nimr al-Nimr Street,\u201d after a Shia cleric executed by the Saudis.\u000a\u000aAnd they\u2019ve done it before: In 1981, Tehran changed the name of the street where its U.K. Embassy is based from Churchill Street to Bobby Sands Street, after the Irish Republican Army member who died while on hunger strike.\u000a\u000aIn a move straight out of the James Bond playbook, the British Embassy \u2014 to avoid the embarrassment of having an IRA figurehead on its letterhead \u2014 sealed off the old entrance and knocked down a wall to create an entrance on nearby Ferdowsi Avenue. Official documents could then list Ferdowsi Avenue as the embassy\u2019s address, safe in the knowledge that the Iranians were highly unlikely to drop Ferdowsi (a poet who\u2019s a national hero).\u000a\u000aRoad rage\u000a\u000aAs relations between the EU and U.K get frostier thanks to Brexit, perhaps a street name change could be the way forward (to boost diplomats\u2019 morale if nothing else).\u000a\u000aThe British Embassy sits on Avenue d\u2019Auderghem in Brussels\u2019 EU quarter, a stone\u2019s throw (and they\u2019ve doubtless tested that theory) from the European Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters and the European Council\u2019s shiny new Europa building.\u000a\u000aIn the spirit of the Brexit talks so far (i.e., mean-spirited and farcical), imagine the hilarity if Avenue d\u2019Auderghem were renamed \u201c\u20ac100 Billion Brexit Bill Boulevard\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the spirit of the Brexit talks so far (i.e., mean-spirited and farcical), imagine the hilarity if Avenue d\u2019Auderghem were renamed \u201c\u20ac100 Billion Brexit Bill Boulevard,\u201d \u201cThe French Only Work 35 Hours A Week Road\u201d or, perhaps most hurtful of all, \u201cGermans Always Win on Penalties Platz.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, if the EU were to pull a stunt like that, they could expect some British reaction.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission has its London base at 32 Smith Square in Westminster, a five-minute walk from the Houses of Parliament. Would anyone, aside from perhaps the Smith family, mind if local authorities changed its name to \u201cUp Yours Delors Terrace,\u201d or maybe even the Brexiteers\u2019 choice, \u201cFreedom Square \u2014 June 23 2016\u201d?\u000a\u000aThe tactic doesn\u2019t have to be confined to Brexit talks. As relations sour between Germany and Turkey, Berlin could rename the street containing the Turkish Embassy \u201cGoat F\u2013ker Straße,\u201d to commemorate comedian Jan Böhmermann\u2019s poem about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\u000a\u000aThe Germans are of course known for their sense of humor, so how about renaming the street housing the Greek Embassy \u201cWolfgang Schäuble Allee\u201d? And while Franco-German relations are on a high since Emmanuel Macron\u2019s election, if the fresh-faced president steps out of line \u2014 too much hanging about with that nasty Mr. Trump, say \u2014 Berlin could always strike a low blow by renaming the street outside the French Embassy \u201cMarshall Pétain Street.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe EU could also have some fun at the expense of Poland\u2019s troublesome right-wing government. Forget threatening to activate Article 7. Instead why not change the name of the street of the Polish Embassy to \u201cDonald Tusk Way.\u201d\u000a\u000aPaul Dallison is POLITICO\u2018s slot news editor.

aVSpecial counsel Robert Mueller (center) | Alex Wong/Getty Images Robert Mueller impanels Washington DC grand jury in Russia probe A former Justice Department official said Mueller\u2019s use of a Washington grand jury is a strong signal the Russia probe has more than one line of inquiry cooking.\u000a\u000aSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a Washington grand jury for his Russia investigation, a key procedural step as he looks into potential collusion between U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia, said two sources familiar with the investigation.\u000a\u000aThe sources said Mueller was now leaning on a closed-door panel housed at the federal courthouse on Constitution Avenue \u2014 just blocks from FBI headquarters and the Capitol \u2014 to present evidence and issue subpoenas as part of his expanding probe.\u000a\u000aMueller\u2019s spokesman declined to comment. A top Trump White House lawyer told reporters he wasn\u2019t aware of the move.\u000a\u000a\u201cGrand jury matters are typically secret,\u201d Ty Cobb, who started this week as Trump\u2019s new special counsel, said in a statement released to reporters by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly,\u201d Cobb said, noting the White House is \u201ccommitted to fully cooperating\u201d with Mueller.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first grand jury tied to the Russia probe. With Mueller\u2019s appointment in May, he inherited the work that federal prosecutors had already done with a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., related to the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn over his foreign lobbying disclosures and contacts with Russian officials prior to the January inauguration.\u000a\u000aMueller\u2019s probe \u2014 which now includes 16 attorneys \u2014 is covering a wide range of issues related to the 2016 election, including financial ties between Russia, Trump and his business partners; the hacks into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, John Podesta; and Trump\u2019s decision in May to fire FBI Director James Comey.\u000a\u000aA former Justice Department official said Mueller\u2019s use of a Washington grand jury is a strong signal the Russia probe has more than one line of inquiry cooking.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt suggests he\u2019s got multiple work streams going on and wants to do a higher volume than if they\u2019re just using Virginia,\u201d the former DOJ source said.\u000a\u000aMueller, a former George W. Bush-appointed FBI director, and his team of experienced lawyers, including Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, are also familiar with Washington courts, and their use of a local jury also makes sense \u201cas a matter of convenience,\u201d the source said.\u000a\u000a\u201cLogistically, it\u2019s a whole lot easier getting from the Mall to federal court in Washington,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey\u2019re three blocks away as opposed to five miles away to get to Alexandria.\u201d

aV"The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary (Clinton) to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."\u000a\u000aEditor's note, May 4, 2016: We originally published this item on April 17 and rated it Mostly True. Since then, readers have contacted us to consider other evidence about the Democratic Party\u2019s fundraising processes, especially state parties sending money back to the Democratic National Committee. We have updated and rerated this fact-check based on new information, changing the rating from Mostly True to Half True. You can read an archived version of the original report here .\u000a\u000aYou had to pay \u2014 or collect \u2014 as much as $353,000 per couple to attend recent fundraisers for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, including one hosted at the home of actor George Clooney. After the affair drew protesters who support Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd, host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Clooney what happened when he encountered them.\u000a\u000aClooney said he was accused of being a corporate shill, which is "one of the funnier things you could say about me." Then he told Todd, "The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket.\u000a\u000a"It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that's important (is) ... we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again. And that's why I'm doing it."\u000a\u000aHere, we\u2019re fact-checking Clooney\u2019s claim, "The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president \u2026 It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."\u000a\u000aWhat we found is that Clooney is technically accurate about most of the money not going to Clinton\u2019s campaign, but it\u2019s not necessarily going to "congressmen and senators."\u000a\u000aClooney is right about the direct support for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Federal law says individuals can't give more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate's primary campaign. Another $2,700 can be collected for the general election. It doesn't matter whether you give it directly or a friend collects it from you on the candidate's behalf, the limit is there.\u000a\u000aWhere the rest of those big-dollar donations end up is a bit of a maze. We\u2019ll try to walk you through it.\u000a\u000aIn this case, the Clinton California fundraisers were held on behalf of the Hillary Victory Fund, which distributes the money to Clinton's campaign committee, Hillary for America. But it also distributes money to the Democratic National Committee and the state parties.\u000a\u000aA donor can also give up to $33,400 a year to the DNC and $10,000 a year to each of the state parties for use in getting its candidates elected to federal office. If you do the math, with 32 state parties included in the Victory Fund, that's $356,100.\u000a\u000aThe state parties generally are tasked with helping elect Democrats at the state level, and the DNC does the same at the national level.\u000a\u000aThe way the donations are divided is explained at the bottom of the Hillary Victory Fund page on the Clinton website. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC and the rest goes to state parties.\u000a\u000aHow does this translate into total donations for each group?\u000a\u000aIf you look at the money going out, which is available through campaign finance reports, it looks like Clinton is getting most of the money.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics by the end of 2015, the Hillary Victory Fund had given $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the DNC, and $2.2 to state political parties. That makes Clinton's share through 2015 almost exactly 50 percent.\u000a\u000aIn the first quarter of this year, Clinton's share was 63 percent of the money that was officially spent on campaigns. Politico reported that the fund also spent $6.7 million for "online ads that mostly looked like Clinton campaign ads, as well as $5.5 million on direct marketing."\u000a\u000aThe Clinton campaign gets the lion's share of the money collected by the Victory Fund, said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, because most of the donors give much smaller amounts, and everything up to $2,700 per person is earmarked to go to Hillary for America first.\u000a\u000aIt's when a donor exceeds that limit that the excess spills over to benefit the national and state Democratic committees.\u000a\u000aOr \u2014 in the case of the state parties \u2014 that's how it appears on paper.\u000a\u000aFederal Election Commission records show that in most cases, the money given to the state parties has been immediately redirected to the DNC. The money isn't staying with the states at all.\u000a\u000aOn May 2, Politico published a story reporting that 88 percent of the state money was immediately passed along to the DNC. In some cases, the state parties didn't even know the money had gone in and out of their accounts until after the fact.\u000a\u000aThe Hillary Victory Fund sent $214,100 to Minnesota , for example, and that state party didn't keep a dime. It was routed to the DNC, which otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to accept the money "since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee," Politico reported.\u000a\u000aWe contacted the DNC and the Clinton campaign to try to understand what was compelling the states to immediately send funds back to the DNC. We couldn\u2019t get straight answers.\u000a\u000aThe Clinton campaign provided a copy of the agreement with the state parties, but it contains no language requiring such a transfer. Although DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said that the terms of the agreement called for states to send the money to the DNC for election infrastructure, Clinton spokesman Schwerin was emphatic that the state committees were free to keep whatever money they wanted.\u000a\u000aHowever, a Feb. 20 Washington Post story on Clinton's fundraising efforts says the executive director of Utah's Democratic party said state party officials understood they were supposed to send back money to DNC headquarters.\u000a\u000aSo if money is going back to the DNC, what\u2019s it being spent on?\u000a\u000aThe overarching response of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC was that the money being diverted to the DNC was, in fact, being used to help local Democrats get elected. Those candidates need voter information, research, media monitoring, organizing capacity and other infrastructure services provided by the DNC to run a successful campaign, and that's how the money was being used.\u000a\u000aHowever, such services also benefit the Clinton campaign.\u000a\u000a"The process Hillary Victory is using has been common practice for a number of years," said Bob Biersack, senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. "The states always agree because they have no choice. Transferring the money back to the national party is a condition of participating. They do it in hopes of getting some good will from the national party down the road."\u000a\u000aAs for the degree to which the system really helps House and Senate candidates, Biersack said there isn't a precise answer.\u000a\u000aHe noted that the party's congressional committees aren't party to the deal. "If the goal was to support those campaigns, surely the national organizations most responsible would be participants. Traditionally the DNC and RNC are taken over by their presidential nominees during the election year, and the first priority for every spending decision is how it relates to the presidential race," he said. "If that campaign were to become significantly less competitive, then the national party might well move to other races, but it would happen in that sequence and in those conditions."\u000a\u000aOne final important note: Spokesmen for both the Clinton campaign and the DNC said many millions raised for the state parties have not been distributed yet, but will be soon.\u000a\u000aOur ruling\u000a\u000aClooney said, "The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."\u000a\u000aClooney is correct that most of the big-dollar donations in question are not going to Clinton\u2019s campaign for president. By law, they can\u2019t.\u000a\u000aWhether the money is "going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress" is a much different story.\u000a\u000aMost of the money appears to be winding up at the DNC, not state parties, as individual donors may have expected. The national party says that money is being used on campaign infrastructure that will benefit House and Senate candidates.\u000a\u000aBut it will benefit Clinton, too.\u000a\u000aClooney\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

aVCampaign donations, lobbying and influence in government and reports on the special interests that are funding elections and buying power.\u000a\u000aFEC inaction\u000a\u000aFEC commissioners acknowledge they\u2019re gridlocked on writing rules that regulate how political parties use their new accounts.\u000a\u000aRepublican Commissioner Lee Goodman said he would only consider engaging in a rulemaking process around the new accounts as part of a comprehensive review of regulations about political parties that would also address \u201conerous regulations on state and local political parties.\u201d\u000a\u000aGoodman said he has long pushed for such a comprehensive look and reeled off a list of regulations he described as overly restrictive, including rules governing coordination between parties and candidates and some record-keeping requirements.\u000a\u000aRepublican Commissioner Caroline Hunter, who sits on the commission\u2019s regulations committee, said she wouldn\u2019t vote to change the rules this election cycle.\u000a\u000aFour of the six FEC commissioners must vote to affirm rules, and the agency\u2019s three Republicans rarely break ranks.\u000a\u000aFEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel, a Democrat, said the agency needs to create new regulations around the new accounts, especially regarding how the money can be spent and whether it can be transferred to other accounts \u2014 something that\u2019s already happening.\u000a\u000aRavel said she believes she and Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat, and Commissioner Steven Walther, an independent who typically caucuses with the Democrats, agree there need to be regulations.\u000a\u000aParties fill in the gaps\u000a\u000aIn the absence of FEC action, the Democratic and Republican parties are free to interpret Congress\u2019 fundraising account changes as they please.\u000a\u000aAnd the parties refuse to reveal their strategies: Officials from the six national party committees either did not comment on the new accounts or referred the Center for Public Integrity to their campaign finance filings.\u000a\u000aBut the parties have a history of working together on campaign finance issues that affect them both, either publicly at the FEC or behind closed doors.\u000a\u000aFor example, last year the parties filed a joint request with the FEC asking permission to establish separate committees that could accept contributions toward party nominating conventions. The FEC approved the request, allowing donors to give up to $32,400 to such committees, contributions that don\u2019t count toward federal contribution limits.\u000a\u000aJohn Ryder, the current general counsel of the RNC, said he has participated in RNC discussions about the new accounts \u201cto a limited degree,\u201d though he said the RNC\u2019s in-house counsel has taken the lead. He acknowledged the two parties share a \u201ccommon institutional interest,\u201d though declined to be more specific.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople need to be both creative and cautious as they approach this,\u201d he said, stressing that he would speak only generally.\u000a\u000aJoseph Sandler, a former general counsel of the DNC, said that during his tenure, party lawyers worked together on issues such as these, adding \u201cI would not be surprised\u201d if the parties are doing so now.\u000a\u000aCampaign finance watchdogs were furious about the new accounts, despite the restrictions. Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer called them \u201cthe most corrupting campaign finance provisions ever enacted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe purposes of the new accounts sound straightforward enough, but the potential for creative interpretation is easy to find \u2014 depending on how lawyers choose to read the law.\u000a\u000aTV is king\u000a\u000aTake, for example, the headquarters account.\u000a\u000aParties need headquarters, but putting money into them usually takes a backseat to buying television ads and other expenses directly related to expenses. This leaves the party faithful complaining about aging boilers and outdated tube televisions \u2014 infrastructure needs they say the building funds could address.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was at the senatorial committee in the \u201890s. It looked great then \u2014 period,\u201d joked Craig Engle, a Republican campaign finance lawyer now at law firm Arent Fox.\u000a\u000aBut the money could also be put toward the less obvious.\u000a\u000aThe account could potentially fund data mining or opposition research, according to an update issued in December by Covington & Burling\u2019s election law practice.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the account to watch to determine how much of an impact these amendments will have on the balance of power between national parties and super PACs,\u201d the firm\u2019s lawyers wrote.\u000a\u000aThanks to the new law, the DNC and RNC may also directly accept money toward their presidential nominating conventions.\u000a\u000aAlthough it\u2019s difficult to predict how much money these new accounts will attract, both parties certainly know how to pull in big cash.\u000a\u000aThe DNC raised 43 percent of its money in contributions of $20,000 or more during the 2012 presidential election cycle and the RNC raised 42 percent, according to data provided by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.\u000a\u000aIn a callback to the heyday of "soft money" \u2014 unlimited cash used for so-called \u201cparty-building\u201d expenses, rather than to support candidates \u2014 the accounts have allowed lawmakers to directly solicit five- and six-figure-checks from contributors. This is something contribution limits barred for years in the wake of soft-money corruption scandals.\u000a\u000aBig donors\u000a\u000aRepublicans, including members of leadership such as House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, have snagged six-figure contributions for the new funds via joint fundraising committees that funnel the proceeds to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s House campaign arm.\u000a\u000aSo far, many of the super donors that have given big to the party committees \u2014 casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, coal executive Joseph Craft III, hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, Arkansas investor Warren Stephens, financier Donald Sussman \u2014 also have a history of writing big checks to super PACs.\u000a\u000aSuch megadonors aren\u2019t exactly on a budget, so giving more to the parties doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll give less to other organizations, although most donors didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from the Center for Public Integrity.\u000a\u000aBig donors that automatically write the maximum check allowed aren\u2019t always asking too many detailed questions about the purposes of the accounts.\u000a\u000aThat might be good for the parties. It isn\u2019t clear how attractive donors will find the prospect of paying for upgraded buildings and big-dollar legal fees, theoretically the main purpose of the accounts, though conventions have historically been a draw.\u000a\u000aTake Rex Sinquefield, a multimillionaire who is the biggest political donor in Missouri. Together with his wife, he contributed $453,600 so far this year to the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 the maximum allowed before the FEC adjusted amounts for inflation earlier this year.\u000a\u000aTravis Brown, a lobbyist and spokesman for Sinquefield, said Sinquefield simply contributed the maximum amount permitted in connection with an NRCC fundraising dinner held in Washington, D.C., at the end of March.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, expect Congress to consider additional ways to loosen campaign finance laws.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for one, is trying to repeat the maneuver this year, recently inserting a provision into draft spending legislation that would weaken rules limiting coordination between candidates and political parties.

aVItalian officials have been bracing for an increase this year on the record 180,000 arrivals recorded in 2016, but that estimate has not borne out | Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images Italy sees unexpected reduction in Mediterranean migration flows Latest figures show sharp reduction in those crossing from Libya to Europe.\u000a\u000aThe number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach Italian shores dropped significantly in July, according to new figures.\u000a\u000aData from the Italian interior ministry shows that about 11,100 migrants made the dangerous crossing in July compared to more than double that amount in the same month in 2016 (just over 23,500).\u000a\u000aIndications of a change in migration patterns continued in the first days of August. Statistics released by the ministry Thursday indicate that between January and the first two days of August about 95,200 people crossed from Libya to Italy, compared to 98,500 over the same period last year \u2014 a 3.42 percent drop.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that we have won the battle,\u201d warned a top migration official at the interior ministry. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very encouraging sign and at sea right now we have only about 400 migrants to rescue, which is a reasonable number. It means this trend could last,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe new numbers contrast significantly with earlier data.\u000a\u000a\u201cNever before had detections been so high in the Central Mediterranean,\u201d wrote Frontex, the EU\u2019s border agency, in its risk analysis for 2017, adding that the route saw an 18 percent increase in migration flows in 2016.\u000a\u000aIn June, Interior Minister Marco Minniti sounded the alarm over migration, prompting the European Commission to draw up an \u201caction plan\u201d for the Central Mediterranean route. Some Italian officials also accused NGOs that conduct search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean of colluding with smugglers, while Rome drew up a new code of conduct for civil society organizations operating at sea. Only a few NGOs have accepted the rules and on Wednesday Italian authorities seized a ship operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet on suspicion that the vessel was being used \u201cfor activities facilitating illegal immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aItalian officials had been bracing for an increase this year, following a record 180,000 arrivals in 2016.\u000a\u000aBut the Italian interior ministry\u2019s surprising new figures are not the only indication that fewer migrants are opting to make the dangerous journey to Europe.\u000a\u000aThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) wrote that July\u2019s figures highlighted \u201ca trend\u201d it \u201chas observed of slower traffic to Italy during mid-summer, and fewer deaths (approximately half of those recorded in July 2015 and 2016).\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reasons behind the summer decline remain disputed.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince the start of the year there is a decrease of people crossing into Libya from Niger,\u201d said Eugenio Ambrosi, EU director at the IOM. That\u2019s the result of several factors, he said, from better information for those planning to migrate to deals with Niger on fighting people-smuggling.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe impression is that the stock of those who want to leave Libya is running out,\u201d he said, adding that only 20 percent of the migrants who reach Libya try to cross into Europe.\u000a\u000aDespite Libya\u2019s political turmoil, the country \u2014 which has the largest oil reserves in Africa \u2014 still attracts workers from other countries: for example, more than half a million Egyptians work in Libya.\u000a\u000aThe EU has also pushed for greater efforts to facilitate voluntary returns from Libya, a figure that stands at over 6,000 so far this year compared to 2,700 in the whole of 2016. European institutions have also disbursed millions of euros in funding for African countries.\u000a\u000aIn Rome, officials identify cooperation with the Libyan coast guard as one of the main reasons why there are fewer arrivals. In recent weeks, the coast guard turned back 10,000 people.\u000a\u000aRome\u2019s arrangements with African leaders have drawn criticism from human rights groups.\u000a\u000aOfficials also point to a recent border protection agreement with local tribal heads in Fezzan, a desert region in southeastern Libya that served as a transit area for 160,000 people last year.\u000a\u000aThe Italians and the EU are not the only ones trying to work with the Libyans. French President Emmanuel Macron stepped up his involvement over the past week by brokering a fragile peace deal between Libya\u2019s warring factions.\u000a\u000aAnd Rome is preparing for more proactive involvement in the area: on Wednesday, the Italian parliament approved plans for a new military mission in the Mediterranean, including in Libyan waters. But in an interview with an Italian daily on Thursday, Egypt-backed Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar threatened to bomb Italian vessels, a warning Italian officials dismissed as \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\u000a\u000aRome\u2019s arrangements with African leaders have drawn criticism from human rights groups.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter years of saving lives at sea, Italy is preparing to help Libyan forces who are known to detain people in conditions that expose them to a real risk of torture, sexual violence and forced labor,\u201d Judith Sunderland, associate director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe U.N. has also often raised concerns about conditions at detention camps for migrants.

Now, the conservatives and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) have the one-seat advantage.\u000a\u000aIn theory, Weil could lead a minority government until the next election, scheduled for January 2018.\u000a\u000aHowever, the leaders of both CDU and SPD expressed support for snap elections. The CDU\u2019s parliamentary leader in Lower Saxony, Björn Thümler, said snap elections should take place \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a hastily convened press conference, state premier Weil said he supported calling new elections, but ruled out stepping down.\u000a\u000a\u201cI happily submit to the will of the voters, but I will not yield to intrigue,\u201d Weil told reporters, condemning Twesten\u2019s move as \u201charmful for democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aSnap elections, which would require the dissolution of the current parliament, could be held on September 24, the same day as the federal election, according to regional daily Hannoversche Allgemeine.\u000a\u000aTwesten has been a Green lawmaker since 2008. In early June, she lost an internal party vote, meaning that she won\u2019t be able to stand in the next regional election. That prompted her move to the CDU, a party with which she had always shared some political affinity, Twesten said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not a traitor and I\u2019m feeling very well,\u201d Twesten said.

aVJudges fear courts becoming a battleground on which Brexit will be fought | Oli Scarff/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight Courts fear return of \u2018Enemies of the people\u2019 hysteria Senior UK judge speaks out on the role of the ECJ after Brexit.\u000a\u000aRemember the British front pages back in November?\u000a\u000aThree High Court judges were branded \u201cEnemies of the People\u201d by the Daily Mail for interpreting British law and ruling that parliament, not the prime minister, had the authority to trigger Article 50 and officially start the Brexit process.\u000a\u000aIt seems a long time ago, a time when emotions were running extremely high over Brexit. The Mail\u2019s front page ended up being a high-water mark of post-referendum hysteria.\u000a\u000aIts attack on the independent judiciary, with its populist-authoritarian undertones, was widely condemned.\u000a\u000aBut it was with one eye on such sinister precedents that Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, spoke out about the role of the ECJ in British law after Brexit.\u000a\u000aHis chief criticism of the government is a lack of clarity. Despite all the sound and fury about ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit, the government\u2019s Repeal Bill actually allows for its past case law to still hold sway in British court judgements. The British courts will have the final say, so technically the U.K. is \u201ctaking back control,\u201d but the legislation is quite hazy about when and how European case law should be taken into account. A court may do so if it thinks it appropriate, but it doesn\u2019t have to.\u000a\u000aNeuberger\u2019s concern appears to be that the government is passing the buck \u2014 and in doing so, exposing judges to the same kind of furious attack that came their way over the Article 50 case.\u000a\u000aImagine the scenario: A group of workers take their company to court over a contentious issue of employment law. The Daily Mail and many Tory MPs think the company is well within its rights, but the judge, citing European case law, rules in favor of the workers. Imagine dozens of such cases, making the news month after month.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a scenario Neuberger seems eager to avoid \u2014 parliament is sovereign and should make a call, he said. \u201cIf the U.K. parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so. If it says we shouldn\u2019t then we won\u2019t. Basically we will do what the statute says.\u201d\u000a\u000aOtherwise, the courts risk becoming battlegrounds on which Brexit will continue to be fought, even after it has happened.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2018s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVThe United States is currently experiencing a \u201chistoric flow of unskilled immigration,\u201d warned Stephen Miller in a bruising news conference last week that saw the White House senior policy adviser harangue a CNN reporter over the famous Emma Lazarus poem on the base of the Statue of Liberty. Miller, who is also the chief wordsmith behind President Donald Trump\u2019s revanchist agenda, speaks with the conviction of a true believer.\u000a\u000aUnveiling the administration\u2019s new immigration proposal, Miller suggested a shift in who does, and who doesn\u2019t, earn a coveted green card. \u201cDoes the applicant speak English? Can they support themselves and their families financially? Do they have a skill that will add to the U.S. economy? Are they being paid a high wage?\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to revisit American immigration policy, which has remained mostly consistent for over 50 years and favors family reunification over skills-based quotas, unlike many other Western countries. But to claim that the current flow of \u201cunskilled\u201d immigrants into the United States is \u201chistoric\u201d\u2014or a break from precedent\u2014is to betray history.\u000a\u000aThe great immigration wave that delivered some 40 million newcomers to the United States between 1830 and 1940 was comprised largely of unskilled workers with minimal English-language proficiency. For every third- or fourth-generation white ethnic family, there is a stunning success story, but in the aggregate, their ancestors experienced little economic mobility in their own lifetimes. Many of them had little interest in even being American; they came to earn money and return home.\u000a\u000aThe proposed shift to a skills-based system might be good for the country; it might be bad. It\u2019s the prevailing system in Canada and Australia, two countries that aren\u2019t known for their hostility to immigrants. But on one important point, Miller is clearly wrong: Trump\u2019s plan would signal a dramatic break with American history and tradition.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAmericans often think of their history as uniquely providential. But we have always existed in a wider global context. The 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a seismic economic reordering in which people, capital and ideas flowed within and between national borders. The same forces that drove European and Asian migration to the United States\u2014the rise of commercial agriculture and the attendant trend of land consolidation, industrialization and growing international trade\u2014also generated massive waves of internal migration from rural to urban areas and immigration to magnet countries like Brazil, Britain and Canada. The United States was a major part of a much larger story.\u000a\u000aMigration patterns varied widely both between and within countries, but for the most part, immigrants to the United States between 1830 and 1940 hailed from areas undergoing fast economic change. The poorest peasants tended not to embark for America, lacking the financial wherewithal to make the journey. Instead, it was more often the displaced landowner or semi-skilled journeyman or artisan\u2014someone who had already made the intermediary migration from countryside to town, and who had at least a modicum of exposure to small-city life\u2014who made the journey. Studies of Italian immigrants in early 20th-century Rochester, Utica and Kansas City reveal a population of families that owned small homesteads in the old country, rather than day laborers or the very destitute. The same trend was evident in other cities and among other immigrant populations.\u000a\u000aYet if they weren\u2019t the poorest of the poor, most immigrants were not skilled or educated. In San Francisco in the 1880s, Irish immigrants were five times as likely to be unskilled as the city\u2019s broader population. In Detroit, German immigrants were almost twice as likely to be unskilled workers as their native-born neighbors. In Pittsburgh in 1900, fewer than 10 percent of Polish immigrants and just 18 percent of Italian immigrants were skilled workers.\u000a\u000aWe like to think of America as the kind of place where an unskilled but industrious newcomer can quickly climb the economic ladder. And sometimes it is. But those cases were few and far between a century ago. Most of the country\u2019s first-generation white ethnics arrived as unskilled factory and farm laborers and remained as such in their lifetimes. In Poughkeepsie, three-quarters of Irish immigrants remained unskilled workers until retirement or death. In his famous study of Boston, the historian Stephen Thernstrom found that just 13 percent of working-class residents born in the 1850s\u2014many of them immigrants\u2014clawed their way into the middle class; among those born in the first decade of the twentieth century, only 14 percent. These trends were the norm.\u000a\u000aEven the most model of \u201cmodel minority\u201d groups\u2014Eastern European Jews who arrived in the United States between the 1880s and early 1920s\u2014were principally engaged in the unskilled needle trades or as small business owners. Stereotypes notwithstanding, in the 1940s just 24 percent of Jewish men in New York\u2014first and second generation, alike\u2014claimed a college- or graduate-level education. In 1957, that figure climbed to 28.5 percent, and, by 1970, it was 36.4 percent\u2014well above similar educational achievement levels for Protestants and Catholics, but still far short of a majority. While 75 percent of Jewish men in that decade qualified as \u201cwhite collar,\u201d most were small business owners; only 14 percent worked in licensed professions like law, medicine or insurance.\u000a\u000aIn the same way that immigration to the United States was part of a global phenomenon, it was also usually an economic strategy. Leaving aside groups like Eastern and Central European Jews, and the Irish, who had compelling economic and political reasons to make a permanent journey, a large portion of immigrants to the United States were \u201cbirds of flight\u201d\u2014temporary residents who came to America to work, stock up money and return home, usually with dreams of buying a farm or shop in their native countries. Over half of all southern Italians came and went. So did 64 percent of Hungarians, 59 percent of Slovaks and 40 percent of Germans.\u000a\u000aWe think of that generation as different and special, and for those families that took root in the U.S., they were. (Certainly, that\u2019s how I regard my great-grandparents: with reverence for the sacrifices they made so that I could one day write this article.) But most immigrants came here with mixed and often hardheaded intentions. Some came in search of opportunity and a fresh start. Others came to experience political enfranchisement and personal liberty. But most were not starry-eyed dreamers\u2014they were ordinary people trying to do the smart thing for themselves and their families; in an age when America experienced rapid urban and industrial growth, moving to New York, Chicago or San Francisco was simply a logical decision.\u000a\u000aLarge numbers of early immigrants arrived in the United States without English-language skills. Even among many Irish newcomers in the mid-19th century, Gaelic, not English, was standard. Studies of second-generation Germans in Wisconsin in 1910 found that roughly one-quarter spoke only German. In Chicago in the 1920s, most movie theaters in ethnic neighborhoods deployed subtitles, as large numbers of first-generation residents could not understand English.\u000a\u000a\u201cI spoke not a word of English when I started school,\u201d remembered Jerry Della Femina, who later became an advertising executive in Manhattan. \u201cBut then why should I have? Italian was spoken at home. I lived in a claustrophobically Italian neighborhood, everyone I knew spoke only Italian, so it was natural that I didn\u2019t know English.\u201d Della Femina grew up in Brooklyn\u2014not in the 1920s, but in the 1940s and 1950s.\u000a\u000aSo Stephen Miller got that wrong, too.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn 1924, Congress passed\u2014and Calvin Coolidge signed\u2014the Johnson-Reed Act, which swung the doors closed to most immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. (Ironically, this legislative act, cruel as it was, went a long way in driving acculturation; without a steady stream of newcomers clad in Old World clothes and speaking foreign tongues, a second generation of accentless English speakers\u2014crazy about baseball and Hollywood\u2014became the new face of ethnic America.) It wasn\u2019t until 1965, at the high water-mark of the Great Society, that Lyndon Johnson and his congressional allies revised the statute. It was the realization of a decades-long dream on the part of urban Democratic congressmen whose constituents\u2014Jews, Poles, Italians, Russians, Greeks, Serbs and other Southern and Eastern European ethnics\u2014had been explicit targets of the 1924 law.\u000a\u000aThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 eliminated hard quotas on countries previously considered undesirable and ushered in a new era of ethnic, racial and religious diversity. Though in its first iteration, the law privileged skilled and educated workers; in its final iteration, it biased family unification. The children, spouses and siblings of legal residents took precedence, along with scientists, artists, professionals and skilled manual workers.\u000a\u000aIn the first years of its enactment, the new law opened the door to large numbers of professionals, particularly from Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. Whereas fewer than 2 percent of immigrants in 1900 qualified as skilled workers, by 1973 roughly 10 percent met that qualification. More than 50,000 physicians and nurses emigrated to the U.S. between 1969 and 1973 alone, most of them from countries like the Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan and China. Within two decades, upward of 80 percent of staff physicians at some New York hospitals were Asian immigrants. The same pattern was on display in other professions, particularly in the STEM fields.\u000a\u000aBut the law\u2019s emphasis on family unification also meant that large numbers of unskilled workers benefited as well, including many siblings and parents of skilled professionals. Of Chinese residents who arrived in the U.S. before 1970, fewer than 3 percent lived below the poverty line in their home country. Of those who came after 1975, roughly one-quarter had been poor. Roger Daniels, a prominent historian of immigration, wrote of a \u201cgreater tendency for recent immigrants to be poorly educated, deficient in English, and to work in the low-paid service trades, such as laundries, restaurants, and the sweatshop enterprises typical of the inner city.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn other words, the immigrants who arrived in 2000 came to resemble more closely the immigrants of 1900\u2014not the poorest of the poor, who can\u2019t afford to make the journey to the United States; not highly skilled or educated workers, but often possessed of some exposure to industry or agriculture.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aStephen Miller isn\u2019t necessarily posing the wrong question. (I suspect he\u2019s posing it for the wrong reasons, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article.) The United States 100 years ago was a nation undergoing rapid industrial and urban growth. It didn\u2019t need immigrants prepared to staff a knowledge economy. It needed a surfeit of hard-working people who could operate a sewing machine, mine coal, produce rubber and steel, dig ditches and build cars\u2014and cheaply.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not the America of 2017, and it\u2019s worth having a discussion about how our economy and immigration policy should align. Part of that conversation must surely include acknowledgment that our service economy may require the contribution of unskilled workers, and people willing to undertake unskilled jobs on, say, farms or in fast-food restaurants, to build a better future for their children. It should be compassionate and pro-family\u2014and being pro-family means helping families reunite and stay together. And it should recognize that today\u2019s immigrant begets tomorrow\u2019s all-American kid\u2014and that all-American kid might go on to develop the next broad-spectrum antibiotic or self-driving car.\u000a\u000aFifty years ago, the historian Oscar Handlin described early American immigrants as \u201cuprooted\u201d\u2014poor, dispossessed, dazed and ill-prepared to succeed in urban, industrial America. Damaged goods. Later generations of historians challenged this idea. They mined a treasure-trove of primary sources and discovered that immigrants were often savvy and industrious. It took ambition, drive and a high tolerance for risk to transplant one\u2019s self, whether from the Irish countryside to Liverpool or from Minsk to Philadelphia. They were strivers whose children fought world wars and built great companies. You can see their legacy today in the faces of so many millions of hard-working newcomers.\u000a\u000aIf we\u2019re going to have a discussion about immigration, we should be honest about our collective history. Today\u2019s immigrants look a lot like yesterday\u2019s. They resemble my great-grandparents, who came to the United States without a word of English or a practical skill, but full of grit, ambition and pragmatic hope. That\u2019s very much an American story, and it has to be part of the current conversation.\u000a\u000aJoshua Zeitz, a Politico Magazine contributing editor, has taught American history and politics at Cambridge University and Princeton University and is the author of Lincoln\u2019s Boys: John Hay, John Nicolay, and the War for Lincoln's Image.

aVThe independents are banding together.\u000a\u000aThat is, 13 independent candidates who feel they don\u2019t fit in the Republican Party in the age of Donald Trump are joining forces with a few registered Democrats, all looking at runs for governor and Senate in 2018. The plan is to create shared infrastructure and funding for a slate of campaigns around the country, in the hopes of making this more than the latest go-nowhere whining about how awful the two-party system is.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut with a historically unpopular Republican president in the White House and a Democratic Party in epic disarray, they think this is actually their moment.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, leaning hard into the symbolism of declaring their independence, the group\u2014put together by the Centrist Project, founded by Charles Wheelan, an academic at Dartmouth\u2014will meet at the Union League in downtown Philadelphia for a weekend-long mini-convention. They\u2019ll get briefings on campaign mechanics and polling. They\u2019ll get a rundown on potential staff hires and interested donors. A member of En Marche, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, will do a briefing on how a party that didn\u2019t exist a year ago won the presidency and now a majority in the National Assembly. Two prominent former Republican operatives\u2014Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, and Reed Galen, who worked on both Bush campaigns and was John McCain\u2019s 2008 deputy campaign manager\u2014will weigh in with advice.\u000a\u000aThe model, they hope: Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, a lifelong Republican who quit the party two months before the 2014 election, picked a Democrat as his lieutenant governor/running mate, and squeaked out a win against the Republican incumbent. Walker recently announced he\u2019s running for reelection, and he says he never looked back at his decision to leave the GOP\u2014and that was before Trump split the party with a working-class message and heretical stances on entitlement programs, trade and basic decorum.\u000a\u000aBeing an independent has its advantages, Walker says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf a candidate comes up and says, \u2018I\u2019m a Republican' or \u2018I\u2019m a Democrat,\u2019 people know within probably 70 percent of where they stand. With an independent, it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, tell me about yourself,\u2019\u201d Walker told me during an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast. But, he allows, \u201cthose that are running as independent have to work a little harder. We have to be a little bit more creative and figure out how to get it done.\u201d\u000a\u000aTerry Hayes, Maine\u2019s state treasurer, who\u2019s already declared she\u2019s running for governor, will be in Philadelphia, getting tips. So will Greg Orman, who fell short in an independent bid against Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts in 2014 and is expected to run for governor next year, as well as Evan McMullin, the former Republican House aide who\u2019s expected to follow his independent run for president last year with a Senate run in Utah against Orrin Hatch.\u000a\u000aJoel Searby, the senior strategist for the Centrist Project, helped recruit several of the candidates. Others attending who are just shy of declaring, he says, include two former Navy SEALs, three potential self-funders coming out of financial services who\u2019ve floated spending a million each of their own money (one has floated spending up to $5 million, he says), a former state party chair, a former big-city mayor and a former congressman.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re committed to running as independents for the reasons of disrupting and changing the political system, not because they\u2019re on the fringe,\u201d Searby says. \u201cWhen they start to see that there is not only a viable plan\u2014a business plan, a fundraising plan, but also a serious network of people\u2014that\u2019s when you can see the light bulbs go off.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are plans for a centrist state-legislator slate in Colorado, to build off the handful of already affiliated state legislators, like Iowa state Sen. David Johnson, who represents the third most Republican district in the state, but after 17 years as a GOP official and endorsing Carly Fiorina last year, announced that Trump had chased him out of the party. Now, he rails against his old party for having no answers for why tax cuts don\u2019t actually do a better job of spurring economic growth, or for why the local rivers and lakes keep getting dirtier.\u000a\u000aClick here to subscribe to the full podcast, to hear Walker talk about the last time he saw Sarah Palin, standing in the middle of a river at age 12 when an earthquake destroyed his hometown and what his meetings during Energy Week at the White House were like.\u000a\u000aWalker has his own list of complaints with the Republican Party. He first ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican out of frustration, he says, with the constraints on energy development he was dealing with as a lawyer in private practice. But he likes what is coming out of the Trump White House on energy now, even as he\u2019s doing his own state-level work toward the Paris accord. And as for people who question climate change, from his perch in Alaska, he says, \u201cit\u2019s real because we\u2019re seeing it\u201d\u2014just look at the entire villages the state has had to pick up and move.\u000a\u000aThe independents are sensitive to becoming spoilers, throwing races without getting into office to make changes\u2014precisely what Dowd thinks might have happened if he\u2019d gotten into the race next year against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, as some wanted him to. \u201cThe greatest barrier right now to this is not money, not tactics. The greatest barrier is psychological,\u201d Dowd says. \u201cIf you can break that by winning some races, then I think the media starts covering it more.\u201d\u000a\u000aSearby has a memo he circulates to statewide recruits, pushing them on the size and wealth of their personal networks and hiring general consultants to help them build campaign plans. He has a growing Google spreadsheet of staffers who are ready to sign on as managers and finance directors, and another of national donors he thinks will be open to supporting individual campaigns, in addition to helping them meet their $10 million goal for the 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), super PAC and corporation they\u2019ve already set up in their \u201cmothership model.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Centrist Project has already raised $750,000 for initial operating expenses, and it has started conversations with people like Michael Slaby, chief technology officer of the 2008 Obama campaign, about building digital resources.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re convinced technology is the answer, that it\u2019s enabled a different kind of politics to more easily puncture the public consciousness. But Macron\u2019s success in France was about the collapse of existing parties and the creation of a new one, not a loose affiliation of people who didn\u2019t like existing parties but were really good on social media and email. They like to talk about a \u201cFulcrum Strategy\u201d of having a few members in the Senate who could swing close votes\u2014a tantalizing possibility in the wake of Obamacare repeal failing by a single vote\u2014but some offer a confused vision that imagines Bernie Sanders joining with centrists just because he\u2019s an independent, rather than a perhaps more realistic scenario in which a centrist bloc attracts people like Maine\u2019s Angus King and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski to force compromises.\u000a\u000aGalen, who unregistered as a Republican after Trump won the nomination, argued that the chaos and the mess in Congress of the president\u2019s first six months have opened the window for independents even more widely than in November. \u201cThe American electorate keeps beating Washington over the head with a frying pan and saying, \u2018We don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing!\u2019 But they keep doing it anyway,\u201d Galen says.\u000a\u000aWalker, meanwhile, has been dealing with the reality of being in office. He\u2019s fought with the legislature in Juneau over the budget. He\u2019s struggled with plummeting oil prices. He\u2019s managed a contorted relationship with Sarah Palin\u2014she endorsed him over her former lieutenant governor, who\u2019d become governor when she quit abruptly, but they clearly don\u2019t get along (\u201cI was looking for results and not just attention,\u201d Walker says).\u000a\u000aEvery version of every argument over the viability of independents cites declining major-party registration among young people, the growing suspicion of institutions\u2014and, increasingly, Trump. But the results have been paltry. Last year, a dozen unaffiliated candidates ran in Alaska\u2014double the numbers in previous cycles\u2014but only two were elected to the state House of Representatives. Testament, perhaps, to the enduring power of the two major parties, however unpopular they might be.\u000a\u000aBut Walker thinks he\u2019s helped show other independents around the country how it can be done. \u201cI think they may have seen the path, perhaps that they don\u2019t have to necessarily fit into a particular box,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can just be themselves and get elected.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Politics\u000a\u000aOff Message

aVPresident Donald Trump is proud of the U.S. stock market. He made that clear in tweets on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 22,000 for the first time, he announced his support for legislation to cut legal immigration\u2014and then quickly changed topics to crow about the market. \u201cWe've picked up, substantially now, more than $4 trillion in net worth in terms of our country, our stocks, our companies,\u201d he declared enthusiastically.\u000a\u000aTrump is right that the stock market is on a tear, up 22 percent since Election Day. But the stock market is not the economy, and the truth is that the economy hasn\u2019t much changed since Trump took office. Growth remains at about 2 percent, wages are still barely rising and job gains, if anything, have slowed.\u000a\u000aThe Dow, of course, isn\u2019t unrelated to the economy. The index of 30 large publicly traded companiesis a popular proxy for the health of America\u2019s largest businesses. If the Dow were crashing, it would be a real sign of trouble. But economists have frequently found little relationship between returns on stock investments and real economic growth. For example, a major 2002 study, from three economists, looked at equity returns and per capita gross domestic product growth for 16 nations from 1900 to 2000 and found little evidence that stronger equity returns correlated with stronger long-run economic growth.\u000a\u000aIn the case of the Dow, this is pretty easy to understand. The 30 companies in the Dow employ more than 6 million workers, a small percentage of the 153 million people working in the United States. And since about 80 percent of the value of the stock market is held by the richest 10 percent of the nation, the vast majority of gains in share value accrue to the rich, not to most Americans.\u000a\u000aFinancial experts and most policymakers are normally hesitant to celebrate a rising stock market. During Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office, the Dow rose 140 percent, a result of him taking over during the depths of the Great Recession. But despite the huge growth in the Dow and the recovery from the recession, few, if any, economists would say the economy was strong under Obama. Economic growth fluctuated around 2 percent, and wages only inched forward. Voters\u2019 anger over the economy was clear with the election of Trump.\u000a\u000aTrump would have trouble replicating Obama\u2019s stock market record if he tried: That would require the Dow to hit nearly 50,000 by 2025. His voters would be better served if he tried to build on the economic gains to spur stronger wage growth and full employment, while addressing structural challenges like weak productivity growth and declining labor force participation. These are hard issues, and they won\u2019t be solved overnight\u2014or in six months. They might not even show up in the Dow: stronger wage growth, for instance, hurts companies\u2019 bottom lines.\u000a\u000aHow\u2019s Trump doing on those more important measures so far? Nothing much has really changed. The president has been touting second-quarter GDP growth, which came in at 2.6 percent. \u201cWe have a growth rate which has been much higher than, as you know, anybody anticipated, except maybe us,\u201d he said Wednesday. The last time quarterly economic growth reached that level? The third quarter of 2016.\u000a\u000aEmployment growth has slowed too. In the first six months of the year, the economy added 863,000 jobs, down from 955,000 in the same period last year. In the first half of 2014, the economy gained 1.3 million jobs. As for wage growth, it\u2019s still muted: Average hourly earnings have risen just 2.5 percent over the past year.\u000a\u000aThese figures aren\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault. Presidents have limited influence over the economy in normal political times, when Congress is actually functioning. In an era of legislative gridlock, the federal government\u2019s influence over the economy is further diminished. But Trump isn\u2019t acting that way. He\u2019s treating the Dow\u2019s record as a kind of endorsement\u2014a signal that the economy has improved significantly since Jan. 20. That simply isn\u2019t the case. A booming Dow is great news for the wealthy investors who hold the vast majority of their investments in the stock market, but if Trump has convinced himself it\u2019s the same thing as a surging economy under his leadership, he might be surprised when Republicans face a lot of angry voters next November.

aVHouse and Senate Democrats have wondered for months whether Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters might choose to focus their energy on launching primary challenges to party moderates in 2018. They\u2019re about to get an answer.\u000a\u000aSanders has decided the moment is right to launch his proposal for the single-payer health insurance system that helped form the backbone of his presidential message. And Democrats who don\u2019t get behind it could find themselves on the wrong side of the most energetic wing of the party \u2014 as well as the once and possibly future presidential candidate who serves as its figurehead.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Vermont senator himself has not explicitly said he\u2019ll support primary challenges to those who won\u2019t support his push for a so-called Medicare-for-all health care plan. But there are plenty of signs that Sanders and his allies view the issue as a defining moment for Democratic lawmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur view is that within the Democratic Party, this is fast-emerging as a litmus test,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, the pollster for Sanders\u2019 White House run.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe single-payer concept is increasingly popular in the party \u2014 high-profile senators like Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have expressed some support, and, for the first time, a majority of House Democrats have now signed on to the single-payer bill that Rep. John Conyers has been introducing regularly for more than a decade.\u000a\u000aBut even as leading party figures have drifted toward supporting a single-payer system similar to the one proposed by Sanders, almost none of them expect anything like it to become law while Republicans control Washington.\u000a\u000aWith Sanders promising to play a major role in 2018 races, that\u2019s led many party officials to worry about the prospect of his involvement in primaries that could upend the Democratic establishment\u2019s plans to win crucial House, Senate and gubernatorial seats.\u000a\u000aThe fears are acute enough that when the Nevada chapter of Our Revolution \u2014 the political group spawned from the Sanders presidential campaign \u2014 endorsed long-shot candidate Jesse Sbaih in the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primary over party favorite Rep. Jacky Rosen, retired former Sen. Harry Reid felt the need to call Sanders directly.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t endorse Sbaih, and don\u2019t let the national Our Revolution group accept its Nevada chapter's recommendation to back him either, the former minority leader implored his friend. Sanders agreed, said a Democrat familiar with the interaction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that [Sanders allied] people will try to make a stir,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide working on a 2018 campaign. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be a liberal Democrat in a lot of these states and be elected. [So] the question is how we improve the lives of people instead of playing these political games."\u000a\u000aSanders allies don\u2019t find that argument convincing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny Democrat worth their salt that doesn\u2019t unequivocally say Medicare-for-all is the way to go? To me, there\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d said former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept no more hemming and hawing. No more game playing. Make your stand.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders himself has stood alongside Democrats in fights like the recent one against the GOP\u2019s health care plans. He\u2019s toured states with wavering Republican senators to pressure them on the issue and quickly condemned a recent single-payer measure pushed by Republican Sen. Steve Daines as a ploy designed to trick Democrats.\u000a\u000aHis team has been working with fellow progressive senators to enlist co-sponsors for his measure, said Democrats across Capitol Hill. Within Sanders circles, the increased popularity of single-payer arrangements is seen as a sign that his long-promised "political revolution\u201d is underway.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s been vindicated by the presidential campaign,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior Sanders 2016 campaign adviser.\u000a\u000aThe Vermont independent has signaled that he expects serious resistance even from Democrats, but he has yet to spell out how he'll fight back.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will be taking on the most powerful special interests in the country: Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the corporate media, the Republican Party and the establishment wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d he emailed supporters last Tuesday.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s clear is that Sanders\u2019 large and politically active following has stopped Democrats from confronting him directly \u2014 including when it comes to offering alternatives to his Medicare-for-all measure. Many still remember the swift and angry January response from grass-roots progressives including Sanders supporters toward Booker for a symbolic drug importation vote, and toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her procedural vote in favor of Ben Carson\u2019s nomination as Housing secretary.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

It\u2019s an issue that everyone is going to be watching to see how they respond,\u201d said Chuck Idelson, a senior operative for the National Nurses United union, which served as one of the most prominent backers of Sanders\u2019 campaign and has long been a needle in the side of establishment Democrats.\u000a\u000aLike many Democrats who are closely aligned with Sanders\u2019 political operation, Idelson stopped short of primary threats. But he refused to rule out the possibility that his group might consider backing challenges of sitting Democratic lawmakers who don\u2019t back the plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur organization, and plenty of other people out there, are going to be holding the Democrats accountable,\u201d Idelson said. \u201cWhat are we electing people for if they\u2019re not going to be fighting for getting people health care when they need it?\u201d\u000a\u000aOther Sanders-allied progressives have been equally adamant on the need to give his Medicare-for-all push a starring role in forthcoming primaries after the recent Capitol Hill health care fights and the stalling of a much-publicized California state legislative proposal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe should run on Medicare-for-all in the 2018 and 2020 elections,\u201d said Bay Area Congressman Ro Khanna, a Sanders backer who has encouraged primary challenges. \u201cThe Democrats that are activists are there, the Democratic voters are there, but now we just need enough of the elected officials to listen to where their constituents are.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe distrust between Sanders forces and the establishment is increasing the tension. Some Democratic senators privately bristled at the health care rallies that Sanders and others organized across the country in January: They were shocked to be greeted by angry Sanders backers in the crowds who loudly urged them to back a single-payer plan, according to several Democratic senators and aides. There is also longstanding grumbling over his refusal to share his campaign email list with other Democrats and, more recently, over his vote against a new round of sanctions against Russia and Iran.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the divide, Sanders allies insist the party seldom acknowledges the role of the senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid in shaping the party\u2019s new agenda, whether on health care, a $15 minimum wage, or free college. And they express frustration that Democratic gatekeepers are still slow to accept Sanders\u2019 likely front-runner role if he chooses to run for president in 2020.\u000a\u000aIn the words of one senior aide to Sanders\u2019 campaign, \u201cA special cloud of denial formed over the swamp when polls started coming out showing Bernie was the most popular politician in the country."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPresident Donald Trump has been accused of being slow to condemn attacks involving Muslims, including after the stabbing deaths of two men in Portland, Ore. | Chris Kleponis/Getty Images Trump's silence on Minnesota mosque attack prompts criticism\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has tweeted 29 times since a bomb exploded at a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota, on Saturday, but he has not weighed in to address the shaken Muslim community near the Twin Cities.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Homeland Security on Saturday condemned the attack, which did not result in any injuries, but Trump himself has not, instead tweeting criticism of senators and the media, as well as threatening \u201ctough and decisive" action regarding North Korea. The White House did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aDespite the silence, community members have stepped up to help the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center rebuild. A Go Fund Me page has raised over $76,000 toward a $95,000 goal in just two days. But Abdu Llahi, a volunteer at Dar Al-Farooq, said it would help if Trump lent his support.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would start a national dialogue,\u201d Llahi said. \u201cThat might change the tone a bit, where him talking about this problem would show that he isn\u2019t the president for a certain group of people but the whole United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Council for American-Islamic Relations said a recent study showed a 584 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims fro 2014 to 2016, when Trump was elected president. Critics say his rhetoric about Islam and his policies, including a travel ban that targeted Muslim-majority countries, may have spurred some of the violence.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

But he has not weighed in on the Minnesota explosion, even though the state's governor has declared it an "act of terrorism."\u000a\u000aTrump also has been accused of being slow to condemn attacks directed againts Muslims, including the stabbing deaths of two men in Portland, Oregon, who stood up to a man who witnesses said harassed a Muslim woman.\u000a\u000aAs Trump takes \u201cmeetings and calls\u201d and hits the links at his Bedminster golf club, where the White House says he's on a "working vacation," CAIR's Hooper concluded that the commander in chief\u2019s priorities are perhaps most clear on his Twitter feed.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has time to tweet attacks on lawmakers, he has time to tweet attacks on the news media, but he somehow has no time to denounce attacks on the Muslim community," Hooper said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPresident Donald Trump has vowed a "very severe" response to North Korea's escalating development of missiles and nuclear weapons. But behind closed doors, the Trump administration is pursuing a strategy that's not all that different from President Barack Obama's approach.\u000a\u000aAdministration officials are saying privately that a preventive military attack is "not on the table," said Bruce Klingner, a veteran intelligence agent who works as a senior research fellow for northeast Asia at the influential Heritage Foundation. Instead, he said, they\u2019re pursuing a five-part strategy similar to what the Obama administration employed \u2014 one that includes increasing pressure on both North Korea and the other countries that facilitate Kim Jong Un\u2019s weapons program.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOther elements include increasing military readiness and capabilities, building up U.S. missile-defense capabilities and expressing openness to diplomatic discussions with Pyongyang \u2014 but refusing to negotiate with North Korea until it accepts the premise it must give up its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aPieces of that strategy played out in recent days \u2014 with no sign yet of ending North Korea's defiance. On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a U.S.-supported sanctions package that threatens to cut off about a third of North Korea\u2019s exports, although questions remain about how strictly nations will enforce the penalties. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson opened the door Monday to negotiating a rollback of sanctions if Kim stops his missile testing \u2014 but North Korea responded with an aggressive statement that threatened military action against the U.S.\u000a\u000aDespite the saber rattling and mixed messages about what it will take to bring North Korea to the table, Klingner said that, privately, the administration has a more \u201ccoherent strategy\u201d than it might seem.\u000a\u000aMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"The Trump administration to date has not yet distinguished its policy toward North Korea from that of Obama," he added. "The president and others have been talking tough about sanctions, as Obama did, but have not yet followed through on any significant increase."\u000a\u000aOther experts agree that, despite Trump\u2019s declarations that he\u2019s abandoning Obama\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience\u201d with North Korea, the basic strategy of ramping up pressure on the regime to end its missile program is a carryover from the past eight years.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would certainly agree that the bellicose rhetoric has increased under the Trump administration, but the policy of trying to ratchet up pressure on North Korea using sanctions and offering talks only after North Korea meets some onerous preconditions is similar to the Obama administration,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association.\u000a\u000aBut at least the rhetoric from Trump\u2019s team and other Republicans has toughened in recent months. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last week that the president told him he would be willing to start a war with North Korea \u2014 regardless of the huge casualties likely to result in the region \u2014 if that\u2019s what it takes to keep Kim from developing missiles and nuclear weapons capable of striking the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf thousands die, they\u2019re going to die over there. They\u2019re not going to die here,\u201d Graham said, adding that Trump \u201chas told me that to my face.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s appointees have similarly stressed that military options are not off the table. While U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley stressed that a peaceful resolution would be preferable, she said after last weekend\u2019s sanctions vote that America is \u201cprepared to do whatever it takes to defend ourselves and our allies.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike Obama, Trump has also taken repeated public swipes at China and its unwillingness or inability to help defuse the North Korea crisis. These criticisms often take the form of tweets, with Trump saying last month that he is \u201cvery disappointed in China,\u201d which could \u201ceasily solve this problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked about the disconnect between its behind-the-scenes strategy and its public rhetoric, Klingner said the administration "just has trouble with its signaling and messaging."\u000a\u000aThe North Koreans most recently launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 28, and experts estimated that the weapon had the power to hit in the U.S. mainland as far as Denver or Chicago.\u000a\u000aThat fact "has everybody's attention," said Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Financial Services Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee, which has investigated North Korea's illicit efforts to acquire missile and other military technologies.\u000a\u000aPittenger said he thinks the administration saw Kim "as a goofy guy, but now with all these tests, he's very provocative." He added: "They are the single biggest threat to our security we have right now."\u000a\u000aAt the Pentagon, spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis declined to get into specifics about steps the administration is considering, saying the military plans for any situation.\u000a\u000a"We are always looking at military options. We don't have anything to announce, though," he said.\u000a\u000aIf the Trump administration wants to do something different, think tank experts suggest that taking military action or withdrawing completely are both bad solutions. They also say there's no magic fix to the problem and, ultimately, the best path may just be more of the same.\u000a\u000aSome experts advocate for increased sanctions on North Korea and on the Chinese banks that facilitate the regime's missile program.\u000a\u000aThe president often complains that China isn't doing enough to help stop North Korea from developing its nuclear weapons. But Klingner said Trump is also not doing enough when it comes to secondary sanctions, such as financially penalizing Chinese banks that participate in the U.S. financial system but do not follow American rules and regulations.\u000a\u000aKlingner pointed specifically to the sanctions the U.S. imposed on the Bank of Dandong in late June for its dealings with North Korea. He urged more sanctions like this on top of those approved by the United Nations.\u000a\u000aPittenger also urged more sanctions against North Korea.\u000a\u000aHe said one first step would be passing an amendment to the House version of the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act H.R. 2810 (115) that would prohibit the Defense Department from doing business with telecommunications firms \u2014 mainly Chinese government telecommunications organizations \u2014 that support North Korean cyberattacks.\u000a\u000aDavenport said, however, that sanctions alone are not going to change North Korea\u2019s behavior and urged the administration to pair sanctions with a diplomatic strategy to begin negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cSanctions can provide leverage to get North Korea to the negotiating table. Then you test the possibility of an agreement,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPresident Donald Trump meets with U.S. company representatives in the White House | Pool photo by Michael Reynolds/Getty Images Full transcript: Trump\u2019s Wall Street Journal interview The president sat down with the Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief Gerard Baker in the Oval Office on July 25.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump called his son-in-law Jared Kushner a \u201cgood boy\u201d while thanking Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker for a positive editorial about Kushner and said the leader of the Boy Scouts told him his jamboree speech was \u201cthe greatest speech ever made to them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe comments, made to the Wall Street Journal and obtained in a transcript by POLITICO, show Trump holding forth at length with Baker and engaging in a familiar back-and-forth. Baker, according to the transcript, asked many of the questions and took the lead byline on the main piece about the interview as well, an unusual step for the editor in chief of a paper with a large White House reporting staff.\u000a\u000aThe Journal has not published a transcript of the interview but it has circulated around the Journal newsroom as well as among others in New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aIvanka Trump stopped by the Oval Office during the interview, telling Baker she heard he was there and wanted to say hello. Ivanka Trump has often made an appearance during interviews with her father, including with The New York Times and POLITICO, to make small talk.\u000a\u000aBaker told Ivanka Trump, \u201cIt was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago,\u201d an apparent reference to a party thrown last month attended by many politicos, business titans and media elites thrown by Washington Post heiress Lally Weymouth, now the Post\u2019s senior associate editor. Ivanka Trump and Baker also chatted about their daughters, who are both named Arabella.\u000a\u000aThe president and Baker also talked about golf and travel.\u000a\u000aThe interview renewed questions internally at the paper about Baker\u2019s leadership and posture towards the White House.\u000a\u000aBaker has defended his paper in the past from criticism, both internal and external, that the broadsheet has been too soft on the real estate mogul and reality television star turned 45th president of the United States.\u000a\u000aIn an internal town hall with employees in February, Baker said that anyone who claims the Journal has been soft on Trump is peddling \u201cfake news,\u201d and that employees who are unhappy with the Journal\u2019s objective, as opposed to oppositional, approach to Trump should work somewhere else.\u000a\u000aThe interview occurred on July 25 and was arranged by Baker after initial requests by Journal reporters, multiple sources familiar with the interview said. A White House official said the president was not personally involved in setting up the interview.\u000a\u000aThree editors sat in on the interview including Baker, Deputy Editor-in-Chief Matt Murray, Washington Bureau Chief Paul Beckett and White House reporters Michael Bender and Peter Nicholas.\u000a\u000aA Wall Street Journal spokesperson said the paper is \u201cproud of the on-the-record interview we conducted with President Trump, which produced multiple, newsworthy articles.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe published the noteworthy excerpts from the interview. We saw no reason to publish the crosstalk that inevitably accompanies any conversation,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aBoth the president and his daughter praised Baker for a Wall Street Journal editorial published the day before, which commended Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner for setting \u201ca disclosure example on Russia\u201d in an 11-page statement released before meeting with Senate and House intelligence committees, describing his contacts with Russian figures during the campaign and after the election.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I liked your editorial today, very nice. (Laughs.)\u201d the transcript quotes Ivanka Trump as saying.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, good, good. Well, you see, you know, my colleagues write those, so they\u2019ll be \u2013 they\u2019ll be \u2013\u201d Baker said, likely referring to the editorial section that is separate from the news section at the newspaper, before being cut off by the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou did a good job,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000a\u201cYeah, you really did,\u201d Ivanka Trump added.\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you very much. Thank you,\u201d Baker replied.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou did a good job,\u201d Trump continued before referring to Kushner: \u201cHe\u2019s a good \u2013 he\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey wrote a very nice editorial, so very good,\u201d Ivanka Trump said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn keeping with our longstanding tradition of total separation between News and Opinion, opinion pieces are the sole responsibility of Paul Gigot [Editor of the Editorial page] and his team,\u201d the Journal spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aThe spokesperson also pointed to Baker\u2019s comment in the transcript about how the editorial the president praise was written by his colleagues, not him.\u000a\u000aAt one point during the interview, Trump seemed annoyed that one of the Wall Street Journal reporters in the room called the reaction to his July 24 Boy Scouts speech \u201cmixed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was no mix there. That was a standing ovation from the time I walked out to the time I left, and for five minutes after I had already gone. There was no mix,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aHe added: \u201cAnd I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful. So there was \u2013 there was no mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe chief of the Boy Scouts subsequently apologized for the political nature of the speech.\u000a\u000aThe full transcript, unpublished by the Journal but obtained by POLITICO, is below.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000aInterview with President Donald Trump\u000a\u000aLocation: Washington, D.C.\u000a\u000aDate: Tuesday, July 25, 2017\u000a\u000aGERARD BAKER: Yes, yes.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tax, other things.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah. Economy, trade, fate of the world \u2013 world economy, market \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: As we speak.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Consumer confidence at a 17-year high.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: What did you say?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Consumer confidence at a 17-year high.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Can you believe it? Isn\u2019t that nice. There\u2019s good reason for it, too, and I think we\u2019re doing pretty well on health care. We\u2019ll see.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah, yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I call it a motion to talk, you know. It\u2019s not a motion to proceed.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: The Senate view \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: It\u2019s not \u2013 basically, it\u2019s a motion to talk. But once you get that motion, it\u2019s in pretty good shape, once you get in. It\u2019s hard to get in, but once you get in. So we\u2019re going to see. John McCain was a great help, coming in as he did. And so it was something I very much appreciate, and we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019re going to know in about two hours.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: What have you been doing, Mr. President, sort of behind the scenes?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: A lot. A lot.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: I mean, what do you think the crucial conversations have been?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Many conversations. I just had one with a certain senator that was very convincing to that senator. So I\u2019ve done a lot. I mean, last night \u2013 last night it was amazing. I was at the \u2013 you know, I was in West Virginia doing certain things and making a speech to the Boy Scouts, and that was some crowd. That was an incredible crowd.\u000a\u000aBut I\u2019ve been working hard, trying to get the senators to go along with it. And I \u2013 you know, I think I \u2013 you know, look, just don\u2019t quote me on this unless it happens, but I think we have a pretty good shot. And that vote\u2019s taking place at about 2:00 today, right? 2:00?\u000a\u000aWSJ: A little bit later, yeah, exactly.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: A little bit later?\u000a\u000aWSJ: All depending on McCain\u2019s plane landing.\u000a\u000aWSJ: If you get the vote \u2013 if you get the vote today to go ahead, what will be the next hurdle that you \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, then you have to go and decide on what plan you want, which way you\u2019re going to go. You want to decide on is it repeal or repeal and replace. If it\u2019s repeal and replace, which one do you want to go? Which form of existing conditions? I mean, there\u2019s many things. But once you\u2019re in there, then you can really negotiate. This is actually the heart, though. Once you\u2019re there, you can, you know, Gerard \u2013 oh, say hello.\u000a\u000aMS. : Hi, Gerard. How are you?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Oh, hey. How nice to see you. How are you doing?\u000a\u000aMS. : I heard you were here. I wanted to come by and say hi.\u000a\u000a(Cross talk.)\u000a\u000aMS. : How is your Arabella (sp)?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Oh, very \u2013 (inaudible). She just got back from Costa Rica. She was there for two weeks. And how\u2019s \u2013 and how\u2019s yours?\u000a\u000aMS. : Oh, very good. (Inaudible.)\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: It was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So you do, you have a \u2013 is it the same spelling?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: I have an \u2013 exactly the same spelling, Arabella (sp). Yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: How did that happen? I think you named your daughter after \u2013\u000a\u000aMS. : It\u2019s an English name, but it\u2019s not particularly common, so.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: It\u2019s not very common, yeah, no. Actually, we were there first.\u000a\u000aMS. : You\u2019re the first.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Mine is \u2013 mine is 15. How old is yours?\u000a\u000aMS. : Oh, OK.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So he\u2019s \u2013 I think you copied.\u000a\u000aMS. : So I copied that. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah, yeah, no, it\u2019s actually \u2013\u000a\u000aMS. : And I liked your editorial today, very nice. (Laughs.)\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Oh, good, good. Well, you see, you know, my colleagues write those, so they\u2019ll be \u2013 they\u2019ll be \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You did a good job.\u000a\u000aMS. : Yeah, you really did.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Thank you very much. Thank you.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You did a good job. He\u2019s a good \u2013 he\u2019s a good boy.\u000a\u000aMS. : They wrote a very nice editorial, so very good.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Thank you.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Thank you.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thanks, honey. Stay around if you want.\u000a\u000aMS. : Yeah, yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So we\u2019ll have the vote today at probably 3:00 or so. And we have the head of Lebanon coming in; that\u2019ll be interesting, a little \u2013 a little change of pace. We keep it interesting. But so we\u2019ll see what that\u2019s all about.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Are you recommending to the people that you talk to a particular \u2013 do you want \u2013 are you saying do this and then go for repeal, or are you going \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019d rather see repeal and replace because I \u2013 I can do either way. If you remember, it was \u2013 you know, it was an idea that I had very early on, repeal. Trouble with repeal is you\u2019ll have millions of people out there that \u2013 well, it\u2019s like we just got the highest confidence in many years; you know, people out there that will say, well, you know, how do we know we\u2019re going to have health care? And I hate to do that to people.\u000a\u000aWSJ: But you\u2019ve been concerned about that, right \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019ve always \u2013 I\u2019m always concerned about that. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t like it from that standpoint. Now, with that being said, you might be able to make a very good deal because I think there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Democrats. But the Democrats are nothing more than obstructionists. That\u2019s all they can do. That\u2019s all they seem to be good at. So they\u2019re obstructionists, so what they will do, even though it\u2019s for the good of the country, they will obstruct. They can\u2019t do anything about Obamacare, and I understand that. They don\u2019t want to vote against it. But now, once it\u2019s done \u2013 it was my original theory: once it\u2019s begun, now they can get together. They can do something. But they won\u2019t do that. There\u2019s too much \u2013 and this isn\u2019t with respect to me; this is years. This is years, Gerry. I mean, if you look at what\u2019s been going on over the last long period of time. I actually asked people that are political people \u2013 I could ask you people \u2013 you know, is it the worst you\u2019ve seen it? And I\u2019ve had every single person, no, actually there\u2019s certain other times that were worse. There were certain times in Obama\u2019s administration that were worse.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: The partisanship, you mean.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You think \u2013 yeah, the partisanship. So, anyway.\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019d rather see \u2013 I\u2019d rather see replace. I\u2019d rather add the replace. And we have a very good plan. That\u2019s the one thing, we really have a good plan. We\u2019ve covered a lot of territory. It\u2019s a very, very difficult situation because you move a little bit to the left and you lose four guys, you move a little bit to the right all of a sudden you have a bloc of people that are gone. You have about a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley, and if it\u2019s even slightly off \u2013 it\u2019s a very difficult \u2013 it\u2019s a very difficult thing, always has been.\u000a\u000aYou know, if you think, Hillary Clinton, smart person, she was the first lady of the country, her entire life was spent \u2013 her entire eight years was spent trying to get health care. Never even came close. Obama \u2013 and one thing I have to say, I\u2019m here now exactly six months. Obama took would you say a year and a half?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah.\u000a\u000aWSJ: He took a year and a half, yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Because people were saying, Trump has not produced. I honestly believe for six months I have done more than just about any president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: What are you most proud of in the first six months?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: A lot of things. I think I\u2019m proud of the Supreme Court choice. And that\u2019s not just a nomination, that\u2019s getting him through. I\u2019m very proud of opening up regulations. One of the reasons you see optimism is because people can actually use their land. They can farm their land. I\u2019ve had tremendous and tremendous \u2013 look, I had 45,000 people there yesterday. It\u2019s the biggest crowd they\u2019ve ever had, and they were \u2013 they were going wild yesterday in West Virginia. But people can actually use their land and they can build.\u000a\u000aAnd I think one of the things that I have to be very proud of is the VA. I think we have a great, great administrator, OK \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Shulkin.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Shulkin.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: \u2013 and a great secretary, David Shulkin. He\u2019s \u2013 he was actually approved 100 to nothing, by the way.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: What about your disappointments? Any disappointments in the first six months?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I\u2019d have to let you know. I have to see where we are with this. Let\u2019s see. Maybe it doesn\u2019t work, but I think it\u2019s going to. And, you know, it is \u2013 it would have been easier to start with taxes, but this is better if it works, OK? If it works, this is better.\u000a\u000aWSJ: More general \u2013 generally.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: But I think, you know, depending \u2013 so if you asked me that question in a month or really at the end of the year, because we hope to get this. We hope to get taxes and then infrastructure. And then I\u2019m going to do a very big \u2013 we\u2019re doing very big trade deals, and we\u2019re looking forward to that. But we want to do, ideally, this first.\u000a\u000aYou know, a lot of people said you should have started with taxes or you should have started with infrastructure. Well, infrastructure I\u2019ll actually have bipartisan support, and I can use infrastructure to carry other things along. So I don\u2019t want to waste it at the beginning, if that makes sense.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Can I ask on that? I mean, are you confident? When you say the Democrats are obstructionists, and obviously they\u2019re looking ahead to the midterms next year, it doesn\u2019t seem like politically for Democrats there\u2019s a lot of incentive, even on a bipartisan thing like infrastructure, that might be popular \u2013 (inaudible). How tough a road is it going to be? In any case it\u2019s hard \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, they tried \u2013 they tried it with me. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads. She didn\u2019t do a positive ad, virtually. And she lost easily, you know, 306 to 223 I think, right \u2013 223, something like that. That\u2019s a lot. And she \u2013 they tried it.\u000a\u000aI mean, honestly, they \u2013 the ads were coming at me. Hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads. And when people went into the voter booth, they didn\u2019t know what she stood for. I always said that. I said if I can take this onslaught personally, it\u2019s going to be a great thing because nobody knew what she stood for. So now they\u2019re trying to change their message a little bit, you know. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s one of those things, but now they\u2019re trying to change their message and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u000a\u000aBut I think that we\u2019re doing very well. Every indication is that in every one of our swing states we\u2019re substantially up, like Ohio. Tonight I\u2019m going to Ohio \u2013 Youngstown, Ohio \u2013 and we\u2019ll be up \u2013 we\u2019re way up. You know, I won the state by nine or 10 or something, by nine or 10 points, without any governor support, OK? So you have the governor of Ohio not supporting you and you win by almost 10 points, which is pretty good because Ohio\u2019s not \u2013 if you remember, you guys were always saying you have to win Ohio, right? There is \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, right, no, it\u2019s \u2013 it was \u2013 and we won, you know, by a landslide.\u000a\u000aWSJ: (Inaudible.)\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: But we\u2019re up. We have now \u2013 are you going tonight? Are you going to the speech in Ohio tonight?\u000a\u000aWSJ: We were in West Virginia yesterday.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, you did? Was that a scene, though? Huh?\u000a\u000aWSJ: That was a scene, yes. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Biggest crowd they\u2019ve ever had. What did you think?\u000a\u000aWSJ: I thought it was an interesting speech in the context of the Boy Scouts.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Right.\u000a\u000aWSJ: They seemed to get a lot of feedback from former scouts and \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Did they like it?\u000a\u000aWSJ: It seemed mixed.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: They loved it. (Laughter.) It wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was no mix. That was a standing \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: In the \u2013 you got a good \u2013 you got a good reaction in \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I mean, you know, he writes mostly negative stuff. But that was a standing ovation \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: You got a good reaction inside the arena, that\u2019s right.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: \u2013 from the time I walked out on the stage \u2013 because I know. And by the way, I\u2019d be the first to admit mixed. I\u2019m a guy that will tell you mixed. There was no mix there. That was a standing ovation from the time I walked out to the time I left, and for five minutes after I had already gone. There was no mix.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Yeah, there was a lot of supporters in the arena.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: And I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful. So there was \u2013 there was no mix.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Sir, can I ask you about taxes?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: So, you know, we\u2019re awaiting the outcome of health, we\u2019ll get a vote. I know you want to get tax reform done. Gary, you talked about it.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, very much. Very important.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: So can \u2013 what\u2019s \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve outlined the principles of tax reform. Can you tell us what you \u2013 you know, what you want to achieve fundamentally in tax reform?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure. I want to \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: What are the \u2013 what are the main goals?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I want to achieve growth. We\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size. But we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have \u2013 nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, 2 ½ trillion (dollars), right, when the most elegant person \u2013 right? I call him Mr. Elegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job. But at that time I was talking $2 ½ trillion. I guess it\u2019s 5 trillion (dollars) now. Whatever it is, it\u2019s a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore.\u000a\u000aWe want to get that back, number one, at a very reasonable cost. And that cost is going to be 10 percent. And right now it\u2019s so high that, number one, you would never do it on a business basis. But, number two, bureaucratically it\u2019s impossible. Did you know that? I have friends that try and get their money back. They say they have to go through years of writing out forms and this and that to bring money back into the country. We\u2019re going to make that one \u2013 like a half-a-page document. It\u2019s going to be very easy to bring your money back in. And it\u2019s going to be taxed at 10 percent, which is a rate that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s within reason. And so that\u2019s one of the things we want to do. That\u2019ll be an easy one. That\u2019s one that \u2013 you know, it\u2019s \u2013 when you talk about a country that\u2019s broken or a system that\u2019s broken, there\u2019s something \u2013 the $5 trillion, let\u2019s call it \u2013 that the Democrats and the Republicans agree should come back in. It\u2019s been out there for years. Nobody ever did anything about it. I mean, Obama \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Well \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Obama could have gotten that money back in very easily, even if they did a separate bill. But nobody \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Right. But a 10 percent corporate rate, that\u2019s \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Ten percent.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Ten percent repatriation.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Repatriation rate.\u000a\u000aWSJ: A repatriation rate. A 10 percent repatriation rate.\u000a\u000aWSJ: What do you think is a reasonable corporate rate? We\u2019ve heard 20 percent, but \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you know, we\u2019re going for 15 (percent). We\u2019re going to see, and we\u2019ll see. But, you know, I don\u2019t want to say anything about negotiation. I mean, we are asking for 15 percent, and we think we\u2019re going to grow tremendously.\u000a\u000aSo I deal with foreign countries, and despite what you may read I have unbelievable relationships with all of the foreign leaders. They like me. I like them. You know, it\u2019s amazing. So I\u2019ll call, like, major \u2013 major countries, and I\u2019ll be dealing with the prime minister or the president. And I\u2019ll say, how are you doing? Oh, don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know, not well, Mr. President, not well. I said, well, what\u2019s the problem? Oh, GDP 9 percent, not well. And I\u2019m saying to myself, here we are at like 1 percent, dying, and they\u2019re at 9 percent and they\u2019re unhappy. So, you know, and these are like countries, you know, fairly large, like 300 million people. You know, a lot of people say \u2013 they say, well, but the United States is large. And then you call places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and you say, you know, how many people do you have? And it\u2019s pretty amazing how many people they have. So China\u2019s going to be at 7 or 8 percent, and they have a billion-five, right? So we should do really well.\u000a\u000aBut in order to do that \u2013 you know, it\u2019s tax reform, but it\u2019s a big tax cut. But it\u2019s simplification, it\u2019s reform, and it\u2019s a big tax cut, 15 \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: And on the personal side, the Treasury secretary back \u2013 way back at the start of the administration said \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, we want to do personal.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah, want to do personal taxes and want to make \u2013 so whatever cuts in the rates that there are \u2013 the marginal rates there are will be balanced by the reduction in deductions, so that the people who benefit from especially at the high end would not \u2013 overall would not be net beneficiaries of tax cuts, right?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. Yeah, that\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t want \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: And that\u2019s still the aim? That\u2019s still very much the aim?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So I shouldn\u2019t say it with everybody in the room, especially Gary, but \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 this is \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. : Yeah, let\u2019s all worry about me.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: The truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed. And this upward revision, it\u2019s going to be on high-income people.\u000a\u000aYou know, I was with Bob Kraft the other night. He came to have dinner with me. He\u2019s a friend of mine. And as he left, he said, Donald, don\u2019t worry about the rich people. Tax the rich people. You got to take care of the people in the country. It was a very interesting statement. I feel the same way.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Well, Gary\u2019s a middle-income \u2013 (inaudible). (Laughter.) He works for the White House. He\u2019s on a \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: He had to pay 200 million (dollars) in tax, Gary. Gary wrote a check for 200 (million dollars).\u000a\u000a(Cross talk.)\u000a\u000aWSJ: There was some focus \u2013 Steve Bannon was saying that maybe you want a higher income tax than the 40 percent, you know, that you might be \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, that was not right. That was not a correct statement, no.\u000a\u000aMR. : That was not a \u2013 that was not a correct \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: OK. OK.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We want \u2013 look, the job producers we\u2019re going to take great care of, but we have to take care of middle-income people in this country. They built the country, they started this whole beautiful thing that we have, and we have to take care of them. And people have not taken care of them, and we\u2019re going to.\u000a\u000aAnd I mean, I have wealthy friends that say to me I don\u2019t mind paying more tax. And I\u2019ll tell you what I sort of don\u2019t like, is when they \u2013 you know, you\u2019ll do your charts in The Wall Street Journal and they\u2019ll be brilliantly done, very nice, and they\u2019ll show that a rich guy who made, you know, $25 million last year is going to pay less than he was. In a certain way, I don\u2019t like that. I\u2019d rather take that difference and put it into the middle-income and put it into corporate.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: You should be able to get Democrat support for that, right? I mean, you can reach across the aisle \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, except they\u2019re obstructionists. If they weren\u2019t obstructionists, I would normally get Democratic support. So we don\u2019t anticipate that. We don\u2019t \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: How would you rate your chances of being able to make those permanent as opposed to temporary?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, do you mean 10 years versus? So it hasn\u2019t really come up. I mean, the last time it was 10 years. When George Steinbrenner died, like with the estate taxes, the estate paid nothing. And if he would have died like two weeks later, they would have paid 50 percent of the Yankees. That would have been the end of the team, right? He had very fine tax planners. But it hasn\u2019t come up. We\u2019d like \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Or doctors. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We would like to make them permanent, but I assume you\u2019re talking about like a \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. : So if it balances in the 10-year window, it\u2019s permanent. The only way you have to end the tax plan is at the end of 10 years if it creates a deficit. We are working towards a plan that is permanent. To get the capital investment that the president wants \u2013 and that\u2019s how you create jobs, and that\u2019s how you create economic growth \u2013 businesses have to know it\u2019s a permanent tax change. So that is our objective.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Does that \u2013 (inaudible) \u2013 for businesses?\u000a\u000aMR. : We think \u2013 we\u2019ve spent an enormous amount of time working as a group to make sure that we get permanent tax change, simplification, and lower rates.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We think we\u2019re going to have tremendous growth. We think money\u2019s going to come pouring into the country.\u000a\u000aLook, we\u2019re losing companies. People don\u2019t even realize how bad it is, but we\u2019re losing companies every single day where they\u2019re leaving because the taxes are too high. When we do this, we\u2019ll have companies \u2013 I know companies that have left. They go to Ireland, they go to other \u2013 I own a lot of property in Ireland. They go to Ireland because of these incredible tax rates, and other places, right? We\u2019ll have companies pouring back into our nation. I mean, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 you know, it\u2019s going to be beautiful.\u000a\u000aI hope we can \u2013 I hope we can do the 15 percent, actually. By the way, 15 percent is not by any means the lowest, but at least we would go from the highest to one of the lower, lower taxes.\u000a\u000aMS. : Another area of real focus has been skill training, as well, to ensure increased workforce participation and ensure that people are trained with the skills necessary for the jobs \u2013 (inaudible).\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: We\u2019ve read a fair bit about that.\u000a\u000aMS. : So you\u2019ve been covering that a lot, but it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s one of the number one things we hear from the private sector, that they don\u2019t have people to fill the jobs they have and they are looking to fill. So we\u2019re working to close that gap.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Which is what makes immigration \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: But one of the things we\u2019re doing that, so Gary and I are working \u2013 because I said, you know, Gary, we\u2019re going to have Foxconn come in. We\u2019re going to have a lot of companies that are coming in. Foxconn\u2019s coming in with a big plan. We have Tim Cook I spoke to, and he\u2019s promised me three big plants \u2013 big, big, big. I said, you know, Tim, unless \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Really? Where?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We\u2019ll have to see. You can call him. But I said, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won\u2019t consider my administration an economic success, OK? And he\u2019s called me and he says, you know, they\u2019re going forward, three big, beautiful plants. You\u2019ll have to call him. I mean, maybe he won\u2019t tell you what he tells me, but I believe he will do that. I really believe it.\u000a\u000aBut I said to Gary, I said, you know, Gary, you go to certain sections and you\u2019re going to need people to work in these massive plants that we\u2019re getting, that are moving in. Where do we have the people? You know where we have the people? In New York state that can\u2019t get jobs, in many other places that can\u2019t get jobs. And people are going to have to start moving. They\u2019re going to move to Colorado and they\u2019re going to move to Iowa and Wisconsin and places where \u2013 like if Foxconn goes to Wisconsin, which is one of the places they\u2019re very strongly considering \u2013 but if Foxconn goes to Wisconsin and they have a very low rate and the governor\u2019s done an excellent job, you\u2019re going to have a situation where you got to get the people. But they\u2019re going to start moving. And I\u2019m going to start explaining to people when you have an area that just isn\u2019t working \u2013 like upper New York state, where people are getting very badly hurt \u2013 and then you\u2019ll have another area 500 miles away where you can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t get people, I\u2019m going to explain you can leave, it\u2019s OK, don\u2019t worry about your house.\u000a\u000aYou know, a lot of them don\u2019t leave because of their house. Because they say, gee, my house, I thought it was worth 70,000 (dollars) and now it\u2019s worth nothing. It\u2019s OK. Go, cut your losses, right?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: While we\u2019re on the economy, can I ask you, we\u2019re coming up very soon to the time to decide whether or not to reappoint Janet Yellen as the \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: \u2013 chair of the Federal Reserve or to appoint somebody else. Are you \u2013 have you reached a decision?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I\u2019ve met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It\u2019s early to make the decision. She doesn\u2019t come up until February/March?\u000a\u000aMR. : End of June.\u000a\u000aWSJ: February. February 1st is \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Yeah, yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I have a lot of respect for her. I like her. She is \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Does that mean it\u2019s possible you would keep her?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I\u2019m not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that\u2019s not too strong. I mean, I\u2019ve seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: So she\u2019s definitely \u2013 she\u2019s definitely in the running to be replaced this time?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say \u2013 you mean to stay?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: To stay.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say yes, she is in the running to stay.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Is Gary a candidate? (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: He doesn\u2019t know this, but yes, he is. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are there other candidates?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I actually think he likes what he\u2019s doing right now.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: That\u2019s what he tells us.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Don\u2019t tell Gary what I just said.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are there other candidates?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, there are two or three. But she is \u2013 she is in the running, absolutely. I like her. I like her demeanor. I think she\u2019s done a good job. I\u2019d like to see rates stay low. She\u2019s always been \u2013 you know, she\u2019s historically been a low-interest-rate person, a believer.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Do you have a time frame for announcing a decision?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say sometime by the end of year, probably.\u000a\u000aWSJ: So you\u2019re going to wait till it\u2019s pretty \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think so.\u000a\u000aWSJ: So you\u2019re not \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: It would need a confirmation process, which will take time.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, but it\u2019ll go quickly. We\u2019re starting to get them much quicker. You know, they\u2019ve been really holding up \u2013 I mean, nine months, they have really been \u2013 that\u2019s all they can do well. You know how many people I have in there? I have \u2013 I have a lot of people in there, and they complain to me. Like Woody Johnson. He\u2019s the ambassador to the Court of St. James, which is England, you know, et cetera, et cetera. And I mean, he said what they did to him was unbelievable. The process was so ugly. I\u2019ve had three or four people to be ambassadors, tremendous people, very successful people. They called me and they \u2013 their whole life they wanted to do this, and they gave up. It\u2019s, you know \u2013\u000a\u000a(Cross talk.)\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are there other names?\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are there other names you might offer who are in the mix for the Fed?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019d rather not do that.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Kevin Warsh has been mentioned. Can we \u2013 (inaudible) \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I haven\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d rather not get involved. But I would say she is, certainly. And Gary is somebody that I\u2019ve gained great \u2013 I\u2019ve known Gary for a long time \u2013 but I\u2019ve gained great respect for Gary working with him. So Gary certainly would be in the mix. I just don\u2019t know if he\u2019d like \u2013 this is off the record \u2013 if he wants to sit down. Interest rates will be moving up one-eighth of a point \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: That\u2019s the exciting stuff. (Laughter.) That\u2019s the exciting stuff.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Right? Yeah, exactly. And then you leave. By the way, then the market crashes and it goes through the roof. You know, what you say. And then he goes off and he\u2019ll play golf and relax for the next 30 or \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: So, Gary, Yellen, and there are other contenders you\u2019re thinking of?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, there are people that are highly respected that I would certainly think about. I don\u2019t know that Gary would want it. I think Gary loves what he\u2019s doing, you know, and he\u2019s doing a very good job.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Who else \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: (Inaudible.)\u000a\u000aWSJ: Sometimes needs to get a comment from Gary. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You want to comment? (Laughs.)\u000a\u000aWSJ: On the record. On the record.\u000a\u000aMR. : This is an interview with the president. This is an interview with the president.\u000a\u000aWSJ: We\u2019ll call your office.\u000a\u000aWSJ: This is an interview with the president.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Can I ask another economics question, while we\u2019re on the subject?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah.\u000a\u000aWSJ: You tweeted this morning about trade talks with Britain.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Can you tell us more about what\u2019s going on?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, but I can say that we\u2019re going to be very involved with the U.K. I mean, you don\u2019t hear the word Britain anymore. It\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s like, nope.\u000a\u000aWSJ: I work with a Brit.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: I\u2019m English. We always make that point. You\u2019re right, yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Is Scotland going to go for the vote, by the way? You don\u2019t see it. It would be terrible. They just went through hell.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: (Inaudible) \u2013 but they\u2019re going to be \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: They just went through hell.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Besides, the first minister\u2019s already made it clear she \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: What do you think? You don\u2019t think so, right?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: I don\u2019t.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: One little thing, what would they do with the British Open if they ever got out? They\u2019d no longer have the British Open.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: (Inaudible.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Scotland. Keep it in Scotland.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: We just had a \u2013 (inaudible).\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: By the way, are you a member there?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: No. I\u2019ve played there, but I \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I thought that course showed well.\u000a\u000aWSJ: It\u2019s a gorgeous, gorgeous course.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Did you see Jordan Spieth\u2019s amazing \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I \u2013 well, I saw his first four holes. And I said, man, that\u2019s the end of that, because \u2013 you know?\u000a\u000aWSJ: Yeah.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So for a guy to go \u2013 you know, to me, that\u2019s almost worse than, like, a triple bogey, because \u2013 but for a guy to go through these horrible holes, hit a bad drive like I\u2019ve never seen \u2013 I mean, he was 150 yards right. I don\u2019t know what that \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Come on, you and I have hit worse drives. You and I have hit \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no, but for \u2013 I know, but for a tour pro it was very unusual. But for a guy to then go birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie, that\u2019s a special \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: He could \u2013 he could be a career major \u2013 he could be the youngest guy to do the career major \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, he\u2019s actually sort of \u2013 he\u2019s in with Tiger and Jack. He\u2019s essentially even, you know, with a number of terms and a number of majors.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Anyway, are you looking forward to doing a trade deal with the U.K.?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. I have a great relationship \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: It would be after, right? They have a time frame.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah.\u000a\u000aWSJ: The one thing is there\u2019s a \u2013 the one thing is there\u2019s a ticking clock with Brexit, so.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Well, yeah. Your tweet made it sound like you\u2019re really talking and so you have \u2013 (inaudible) \u2013\u000a\u000a(Cross talk.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with the prime minister. And we are absolutely looking to do a major trade deal.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Would the idea be that the trade deal will kick in pretty much as soon as Brexit happens?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: As soon as it\u2019s appropriate to have it kick in, absolutely. And it\u2019ll be a big trade deal \u2013 much, much more business than we do right now, many, many times.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are there keys that would be the important pieces of it? What would \u2013 can you highlight specific \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: There\u2019ll be certain pieces. It\u2019s not \u2013 there\u2019ll be certain pieces. I mean, one of the things that \u2013 I have a very good relationship with the EU people and all, but they are very, very protectionist. You know, our farmers and others can\u2019t even deal with \u2013 you know, you can\u2019t sell in. It\u2019s very unfair. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. It\u2019s so stacked against the United States. Now, the EU was conceived to the point that they wanted to do something to compete with the United States. Well, you know, you could say that\u2019s a friendly act or an unfriendly act. But it\u2019s very protectionist. Among the most, we have farm products that you just can\u2019t get into the EU. And we don\u2019t do that to them.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: So you\u2019d include an agriculture deal with the U.K.?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you, you know, I did \u2013 I did thing that nobody even wrote about \u2013 although, you did. (Laughter.) But when I was with President Xi, who I have a very good relationship with, I said: Do me a favor. Would you allow cattle, please, to come in? I was last night in West Virginia, and I had farmers coming up to me and hugging me and kissing me because of the cattle stuff. They actually weren\u2019t from West Virginia; they were from other places. (Laughter.) But, you know, it was the Boy Scouts, so they came from all over the country, but \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Could you do a services deal with the U.K.? Could that include services?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. It would include everything.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Including financial services?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, no, it would be very \u2013 it would be \u2013 it would be very all-in with \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: That\u2019s a big deal.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Because we have a lot of financial companies already paring back their numbers, moving people to Frankfurt, already clearing out of London some. Do you think that\u2019s a good idea right now, ahead of this?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: That\u2019s up to them. But we\u2019re going to have a very good relationship with the U.K. And we do have to talk to the European Union, because it\u2019s not a reciprocal deal, you know.\u000a\u000aThe word reciprocal, to me, is very important. For instance, we have countries that charge us 100 percent tax to sell a Harley-Davidson into that country. And yet, they sell their motorcycles into us, or their bikes, or anything comparable, and we charge them nothing. There has to be a reciprocal deal. I\u2019m all about that. And you know, it\u2019s very interesting, at the border \u2013 people may have problems with border, but when you say reciprocal, everybody says, oh, that\u2019s fair. So people have a problem with charging a 10 percent tax, which they shouldn\u2019t have but they do. But when you say you\u2019re going to charge reciprocal charge \u2013 in other words, what they charge we\u2019re going to charge \u2013 all of a sudden these same people \u2013 it might be much more money \u2013 but these same people, all of a sudden they\u2019re OK with it. So we have got to be much smarter.\u000a\u000aYou know, our country was built, to a large extent, on protecting our manufacturers. If you go back to Jefferson, you go back to all of these great, great people that ran the United States properly, it was really based on a certain form of tariff and a certain form of protection. We\u2019re just the opposite now. We\u2019re the people that are getting beat up \u2013 one of the reasons I think I\u2019m talking to \u2013 I\u2019m sitting behind this beautiful desk as opposed to somebody else.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: What about \u2013 just, very quickly, on tariffs. On steel tariffs, you committed to imposing steel tariffs. You haven\u2019t done that, but you still \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we\u2019re waiting \u2013 we\u2019re waiting till we get everything completed. We don\u2019t want to do at this moment. We\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to wait till we get everything completed here. We\u2019re going to see. It\u2019s a very unfair situation. They\u2019re dumping steel in our country. It\u2019s extremely unfair. But we like to keep it as simple as \u2013 we like to keep very complicated subjects as simple as possible. So we\u2019re waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure. But we\u2019re going to be addressing the steel dumping at a very \u2013 fairly soon.\u000a\u000aWe \u2013 just so you understand \u2013 we have massive reports. You know, a lot of this stuff you can\u2019t just walk in and say I\u2019m going to do this. You have to do statutory studies. And then you have to wait 90 days. And then you have to do another. And you have to wait another 20 days. It doesn\u2019t go that quickly. It\u2019s like NAFTA. You know, you have a six-month termination. I was ready to terminate NAFTA. I was looking forward to it, frankly, because NAFTA\u2019s a horrible deal for the United States. And then I got a call from the president of Mexico, who\u2019s a terrific guy, and I got a call from the prime minister of Canada. And they heard I was getting ready to terminate it. And they said: Would you have a meeting with us first? I said, yes. And if you look at my speeches, I\u2019ve always said, either renegotiate it or terminate it.\u000a\u000aNow, renegotiating it is easier. And we\u2019re in the midst of a renegotiation right now. So we\u2019ll see. And maybe we\u2019ll have to terminate it. I happen to think NAFTA\u2019s one of the truly bad deals \u2013 I mean, outside of the Iran deal, which is one of the worst deals in history \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Do you think it\u2019s salvageable? Do you think NAFTA\u2019s salvageable?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: It may be salvageable.\u000a\u000aWSJ: What do you need for that?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say \u2013 I would say it may be salvageable. But certainly, I have an obligation to give it a shot.\u000a\u000aWSJ: What are you looking for specifically \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019m looking for fairness.\u000a\u000aWSJ: But what does that \u2013 can you give an example?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, it means \u2013 look, our automobile industry has just left us and gone to Mexico \u2013 I mean, a big chunk of it. And it\u2019s very unfair for them to take our companies, built their cars, and then sell the car back into our country with no tax. It\u2019s very unfair. They fire all our people in Michigan and Ohio, and they take it, and they build a car. And now they sell the car back in with no tax. It\u2019s not fair.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Do they get that \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: We have a $70 billion trade deficit with China, as an example.\u000a\u000aWSJ: What does the president of Mexico say when you say that?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: He\u2019s not thrilled. But that\u2019s OK. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about what he said to me.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Does he \u2013 but does he disagree with you about that view, or does he \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, there\u2019s not much to disagree with. Look, we have a $70 billion \u2013 we have a $70 billion trade deficit. What is anybody saying? With China, we have 350 to 504. Nobody can really define it, deficit. We have a trade deficit of $350 to $504 billion each year. We\u2019re not going to be \u2013 it\u2019s just not going to happen that way anymore.\u000a\u000aWSJ: You mentioned the Iran deal, but it\u2019s been certified as in compliance twice now. It comes up again in September. Would you \u2013 is there going to come a point where you just \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we\u2019re doing major studies. Oh, I would be very surprised if they will be \u2013 look, we\u2019ve been extremely nice to them. We\u2019ve been extremely nice to them in saying they were compliant, OK? We\u2019ve given them the benefit of every doubt. But we\u2019re doing very detailed studies. And personally, I have great respect for my people. If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Do you expect them to be declared noncompliant the next time?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Personally, I do. I do.\u000a\u000aWSJ: In September?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think they\u2019ll be noncompliant. I think they\u2019re taking advantage of this country. They\u2019ve taken advantage of a president, named Barack Obama, who didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing. And I do not expect that they will be compliant.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Will you overrule your staff on that, if they come back with a recommendation \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, sure. Sure. Look, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It\u2019s easier to say they comply. It\u2019s a lot easier. But it\u2019s the wrong thing. They don\u2019t comply. And so we\u2019ll see what happens. I mean, we\u2019ll talk about this subject in 90 days. But, yeah, I would be \u2013 I would be surprised if they were in compliance.\u000a\u000aSTAFF: Mr. President? I\u2019m sorry. We just have time for a few more.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Mr. President \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: OK, if I may, can I ask you quick, Mr. President, we\u2019ve talked about your achievements and disappointments. I was reminded of President Eisenhower, when he left office, said that his two biggest mistakes in officer were both sitting on the Supreme Court. From things you\u2019ve been saying in the \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: So far I can\u2019t say that, right?\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: From the same \u2013 from the things you\u2019ve been saying in the last week or so, and tweeting, it sounds as though you may think that maybe your biggest mistake is running the Justice Department. Is that \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019m disappointed in Jeff Sessions, yes.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Do you want him to leave?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Number one, they should go after the leakers in intelligence. I don\u2019t mean the White House stuff where they\u2019re fighting over who loves me the most, OK? (Laughter.) It\u2019s just stupid people doing that.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Anthony\u2019s already taken care of that. (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I know, that\u2019s just \u2013 and Anthony will handle that. (Laughter.) I can \u2013 Anthony can do that out of his back pocket, OK? I\u2019m talking about intelligence leaks. I\u2019m talking like the story about Syria that was in The New York Times the other day. I\u2019m \u2013 which by the way, was a decision made by people, not me. But, you know, they wrote it 100 \u2013 it was in the \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: The Post, I thought. It was in The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: It was in The Washington Post. That was not something that I was involved in, other than they did come and they suggested. It turns out it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of al-Qaida we\u2019re giving these weapons to. You know, they didn\u2019t write the truthful story, which they never do. So all of those things are very important. But, no, I\u2019m very disappointed in the fact that the Justice Department has not gone after the leakers. And they\u2019re the ones that have the great power to go after the leakers, you understand. So \u2013 and I\u2019m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aWSJ: You can fire him.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, Jeff \u2013 I could. But we\u2019ll see what happens. But I was \u2013 I appointed a man to a position. And then shortly after he gets the position, he recused himself. I said, what\u2019s that all about? Why didn\u2019t you tell me that you were going to do that, and I wouldn\u2019t have appointed you? But I appointed him. And shortly thereafter, he recused himself. So I think that is a \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: You also suggested in Cleveland today they should be going \u2013 or, yesterday \u2013 they should be going after Hillary Clinton. Is that \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to. But I see the way they go after us on a witch hunt, you know? The Russian \u2013 the Russian story\u2019s all an excuse for the Democrats losing. In fact, if you read the book, \u201cShattered,\u201d they have a whole chapter where they sat the day after the election and they said: Yeah, Russia. It was Russia. And, you know, Trump was involved. OK, the one thing interesting, you never heard me even associated with anybody. But, no, that\u2019s a total witch hunt, the whole Russia story. It\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s a hoax. We had no collusion with Russia. We never dealt with Russia.\u000a\u000aPeople that were on the campaign, like Corey, came in yesterday. It was very interesting. He was being interviewed. He said \u2013 I was watching, Corey Lewandowski \u2013 he says: I was here from the beginning. And I must be honest with you, I never dealt with any Russians. He was only the campaign manager. I can even look at Hope. She was here from virtually the same day that Corey started, those two. Hope, how many Russians have you seen involved in the campaign, OK?\u000a\u000aHOPE HICKS: None. (Laughs.)\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: OK? You know, I mean, it\u2019s sad. So they do that. And I say, that\u2019s fine. But then we should really look at real crimes, because real crimes are what Hillary did with 33,000 emails, where she deleted them and bleached them after getting a subpoena. Real crimes are what\u2019s happening and what happened with the uranium deal. And also \u2013 I mean, you can say the speeches made while she was secretary of state where they paid her a fortune, Podesta owning a big company in Russia \u2013 they talk about me. I have nothing to do with Russia.\u000a\u000aYou know, I put out a letter from a very \u2013 from the biggest law firm saying Trump has no involvement with Russia. I don\u2019t. I have no involvement. I mean, I had Ms. Universe there, like, nine years ago, eight years ago, something like that. But I have nothing to do with Russia. So \u2013 and it\u2019s very funny, because all of these people that have been on the campaign, some of them right from the beginning \u2013 Anthony\u2019s another example. You\u2019ve been there. You know \u2013\u000a\u000aANTHONY SCARAMUCCI (?): (Inaudible) \u2013 I said from the podium on Friday that\u2019s there\u2019s nothing to the Russia story. I said on the weekend there was nothing to the Russia story.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You know, Anthony came in to see me before it all began. And he said, I want to back you for president. This was before the June 16th day. I said, Anthony, I\u2019m not really sure that I\u2019m running. I\u2019m not sure. I may, but I\u2019m not sure. He said, you got to run, you got to run. I want to endorse you. I said, but I\u2019m not sure. This was a few months earlier than when I ran. And he was leaving and he was disappointed. I say, Anthony, what are you going to do? He goes, I got to back somebody, because that\u2019s the way he is. That\u2019s his personality. And he went to a very good guy named Walker.\u000a\u000aThen I came after the hedge fund business. So he wasn\u2019t in love with me for a short period of time. And he backed Bush. And that was OK. But his first choice was Trump. I think it\u2019s important to say that because, you know. Is that a true story, by the way?\u000a\u000aMR. SCARAMUCCI (?): I was hitting you a little bit \u2013 (inaudible) \u2013 hedge funds first.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Give me those notes, Hope, come on, just give \u2013 I can\u2019t read it. What do you think, I have 20/20 perfect \u2013\u000a\u000aMS. HICKS: I was just saying, you self-funded.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Huh?\u000a\u000aMS. HICKS: You self-funded.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, yeah, I self-funded much of my \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Just on Sessions, just one thing. Would you like to see him step aside? Would you like to see him resign? Would it be in the country\u2019s best interest just \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019m just very disappointed in him. I\u2019m disappointed in, you know, a number of categories. I told you, the leakers. He should have \u2013 he should be after them. So many people say to me: Why are they going after you on nothing and they leave Hillary Clinton alone on, you know, really major things? And it is \u2013 so I\u2019m disappointed in him. And don\u2019t forget, when they say he endorsed me, I went to Alabama. I had 40,000 people, you may have been there, remember, in Mobile?\u000a\u000aWSJ: I remember.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I had 40,000 people. He was the senator from Alabama. I won the state by a lot, massive numbers. A lot of the states I won by massive numbers. But he was a senator. He looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, what do I have to lose, and he endorsed me. So it\u2019s not like a great, loyal thing about the endorsement. But I\u2019m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Are you willing for the status quo to continue, though? At what point do you say enough?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019m just looking at it. I\u2019ll just see.\u000a\u000aWSJ: What about Bob Mueller?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: It\u2019s a very important, very important thing.\u000a\u000aWSJ: I mean, but, Bob Mueller is also really the one leading this investigation. It\u2019s his job to see \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we\u2019re going to see.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: And he\u2019s investigating Russia \u2013 your Russian connection \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: He\u2019s the Russian guy. So Sessions has recused himself, but is Bob Mueller\u2019s job safe? There is speculation \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, we\u2019re going to see. I mean, I have no comment yet, because it\u2019s too early. But we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re going to see. Here\u2019s the good news: I was never involved with Russia. There was nobody in the campaign. I\u2019ve got 200 people that will say that they\u2019ve never seen anybody on the campaign. Here\u2019s another \u2013 he was involved early. There\u2019s nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia. We had nothing to do with Russia. They lost an election and they came up with this as an excuse. And the only ones that are laughing are the Democrats and the Russians. They\u2019re the only ones that are laughing. And if Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t recuse himself, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this subject.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Would you consider \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You know, it was very interesting. Trey Gowdy said today \u2013 again, he\u2019s a very straight shooter, he\u2019s a good guy \u2013 he said, no, I understand the president. He was on Fox. He said: I understand the president. You put a man in office who really wanted that job. I actually said to him \u2013 and you know some of my lawyers, it\u2019s not \u2013 you know, off the record, it\u2019s not exactly \u2013 right? You know some of them.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: I know Marc quite well.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, but a lot of them. But I put a man in office \u2013 and he said this. And he goes in office, then he immediately recuses himself. I fully understand the president. You know, and a lot of people do, a lot of people. He \u2013 you know, I don\u2019t go to loyalty. I think it\u2019s disloyal to the office of the presidency, not necessarily me. I think it\u2019s very disloyal to the office of the presidency. And if he didn\u2019t do that, you wouldn\u2019t have all this stuff. You know, you wouldn\u2019t have it.\u000a\u000aSo, just a couple of things before we finish. Just \u2013 I\u2019m sure you love Stuart Varney. But he just came out, $4 trillion in value in the stock market. RNC has more than 80 million in cash, whereas the Democrats owe money, OK, although they\u2019re trying to come up with their new campaign. Trust me, it won\u2019t work. And I said it the last time (and I was wrong ?). Immigration went down 78 percent at the border \u2013 78 percent at the border. Kelly\u2019s done a great job.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: You going to veto the Russian sanctions legislation?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I haven\u2019t seen them yet. I haven\u2019t seen them in final form. I will say this, Congress, if they\u2019re going to negotiate, they make the worst deals I\u2019ve ever seen. They made NAFTA. They made \u2013 you know, they allowed the Iran deal to go through.\u000a\u000aWSJ: You said you\u2019re opposed \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I make good deals. I don\u2019t make bad deals. I make good deals. So, but, I haven\u2019t made my \u2013 I have not seen them. I have to see.\u000a\u000aBy the way, a lot of things have taken place in that agreement that are a lot different from what it was two weeks ago \u2013 a lot of things.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: You also \u2013 you brought in Anthony, obviously. Are you planning other changes \u2013 are you planning other changes in the White House? After you brought in Anthony, are you planning other changes?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I mean, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see. I do say this, I believe we\u2019ve done more than just about any president of the United States in six months. And I was going to tell you before, so a lot of times I\u2019ll turn on television or I\u2019ll read in The Wall Street Journal, right \u2013\u000a\u000aWSJ: Thank you.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: \u2013 what\u2019s Trump doing? He hasn\u2019t produced health care. I\u2019m not even six months yet, right? So these guys went eight years \u2013 Hillary Clinton, eight years, got nothing. Obama went a year and a half, almost two years, and they had to sell their soul. They had to give away the state of Nebraska in order to buy that vote. And that was two years. I\u2019m six months. They got to give me a little break, OK? And today we\u2019re having a big vote, and we\u2019ll see what happens. But today\u2019s vote is big, because once you get in \u2013 once you\u2019re allowed to talk a lot of \u2013\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: But we can\u2019t expect any more staff changes in the immediate \u2013 in the immediate future?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I don\u2019t think so.\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: No?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: But I\u2019m very happy with Anthony. I think Anthony is going to do amazing.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Would you consider pardons, Mr. President, given the investigation is \u2013\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: You know what? I don\u2019t even think of pardons. Here\u2019s why, nobody did anything wrong. Look at Jared, everybody \u2013 we do appreciate the editorial \u2013 but everybody said Jared Kushner. Jared\u2019s a very private person. He doesn\u2019t get out. I mean, maybe it\u2019s good or maybe it\u2019s bad what I do, but at least people know how I feel. Jared\u2019s this really nice, smart guy, who\u2019d love to see peace in the Middle East and in Israel, OK?\u000a\u000aWSJ: Gerry, yeah, Gary and are bouncers from \u2013 (inaudible). (Laughter.)\u000a\u000aMR. BAKER: Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks.\u000a\u000aWSJ: Tom Barrack as Mexican ambassador?\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\u2019m thinking about it. What do you think? Do you like him?\u000a\u000aWSJ: Yeah.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP: Tom Barrack, yes? Call him up, tell him I\u2019m giving it to him. (Laughter.)

aVLISBON \u2014 After the best part of a decade of recession and stagnation, Portugal finally looked to be getting back on its feet. Then it all went wrong.\u000a\u000aIn June, just one day after the country had been freed from eight years of EU-imposed austerity measures, forest fires swept through the country, killing 64 people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Portuguese people have been shaken by the greatest catastrophe of recent decades,\u201d Prime Minister António Costa told parliament in his State of the Nation speech. \u201cIn less than 24 hours we passed from relief to turmoil, from satisfaction to consternation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fires weren\u2019t the only crisis that Costa\u2019s government had to deal with over the summer as the mood turned somber in a country that had been on a roll after being crowned European football champions for the first time last summer, had crooned its way to victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, and got its man placed at the head of the United Nations.\u000a\u000aTwo weeks after the fires, the nation\u2019s self-confidence suffered another blow when thieves broke into a military base northeast of Lisbon.\u000a\u000aTheir haul reportedly included 44 rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons, 150 hand grenades, 264 blocks of plastic explosives, dozens of detonators and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears\u201d \u2014 Opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho\u000a\u000aAs rumors circulated that the weapons were destined for international terrorists or organized crime gangs, the heist was viewed as a national humiliation that undermined the trust of NATO allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis calls into question the prestige of Portugal, the prestige of the armed forces, the authority of the state and the security of the Portuguese people,\u201d Marcelo Rebel de Sousa, Portugal\u2019s figurehead president, said after the theft at the base at Tancos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m demanding a full and complete investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be done no matter who it hurts, and nobody is immune.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta faced demands for cabinet resignations as his Socialist (PS) government and the center-right opposition traded accusations over who was to blame for defense cuts that left the army with unguarded perimeter fences and broken surveillance systems; greed-driven forestry regimes that made the countryside flammable; chaotic civil defense planning; and investments in dysfunctional communication systems that hindered warnings as walls of flame roared toward defenseless villages and crowded highways.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister himself was lambasted for vacationing in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands as security concerns and political tensions rose amid the fallout from the arms heist.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears,\u201d opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho told supporters of his center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD). \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of leadership and a lack of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta resisted calls to fire his interior and defense ministers, but then faced a further blow when three junior ministers resigned as the state prosecutors\u2019 office was poised to formally name them in an investigation into all-expenses-paid trips to last year\u2019s European football championship in France, allegedly offered by Galp Energeia, a power company.\u000a\u000aPopularity persists\u000a\u000aMinisters acknowledge the government is facing its most difficult time since coming to power in November 2015.\u000a\u000aStill, the Socialists have hit back, claiming that problems behind the fires and the robbery lie with the austerity-driven policies of the previous government led by Passos Coelho. The center-right has also been embarrassed by reports that three of its elected officials accepted a junket paid for by Chinese tech company Huawei.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down\u201d \u2014 Political expert André Azevedo Alves\u000a\u000aSo far, the gloom appears to have done little to hurt the government\u2019s popularity.\u000a\u000aCosta remains by far the most popular party leader. He enjoys a 48.9 percent approval rating, according to a poll published Saturday in the weekly Expresso newspaper. With a drop of just 0.6 points over the past two months, he\u2019s way ahead of Passos Coelho on 39.2 percent.\u000a\u000aThe PS has even increased its lead. Saturday\u2019s poll had the party at 40.8 percent, up 0.4 percent on July. The PSD dropped back to 28.1 percent.\u000a\u000aNor is there any sign that voters disaffected by the summer crises are turning to the two far-left parties that shore up Costa\u2019s minority government.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) is on 7.6 percent and the Left Bloc (BE) on 8.4 percent. Both have been steadily losing support since the October 2015 general election that brought Costa to power.\u000a\u000aHowever, analysts say the summer events could still take their toll.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen any really substantial impact on the polls, but this could mark a turning point over the longer term,\u201d said André Azevedo Alves, a political expert at Lisbon\u2019s Catholic University of Portugal and St. Mary\u2019s University, London.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tragic scale of the fires and the manner of the robbery at Tancos reflects on the institutions of state and could have a corrosive effect,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until now everything appeared to be going well under this government, we\u2019d been exceeding expectations, now things are going worse than expected.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeftists flex their muscles\u000a\u000aCosta now faces two crucial mid-term tests: Nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October 1 and the opening on August 21 of negotiations with his far-left partners on next year\u2019s state budget.\u000a\u000aThe leftists are demanding concessions. After two years of waving through budget bills that have won EU plaudits and brought the deficit down to its lowest level since democracy was restored in 1974, they\u2019re demanding a faster roll back of austerity.\u000a\u000aLeft Bloc leader Catarina Martins has been addressing party rallies around the country, cranking up pressure over the budget. Her demands range from tax breaks for the low earners to lowering the retirement age and more money for civil servants, pensions and public services.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a country where a mother who works full time and earns the minimum wage lives in poverty because the wage is so low that she cannot support herself and her child,\u201d Martins told a rally Thursday in Monte Gordo, a popular vacation resort in the southern Algarve region. \u201cNobody should be left behind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe very public demands of both far-left parties will make it harder to strike a deal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down,\u201d said Azevedo Alves. \u201cThere are ways out of this, but it will be more of a challenge than in previous years.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the rosier economic climate, unions are also demanding more.\u000a\u000aWorkers at the Autoeuropa car plant \u2014 the country\u2019s third biggest exporter \u2014 are threatening a strike to interrupt production of Volkswagen\u2019s new T-ROC model. They voted to reject a deal on wages and working time which, the company said, included a 16 percent pay rise for some workers.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.\u000a\u000aVenezuela is another source of tension between the government and its hard-left backers.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communists on Thursday issued a statement denouncing protests against Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro as \u201cdestabilizing, terrorist and putschist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe PCP criticized Costa\u2019s government for signing up to the European Union position not recognizing the violence-marred elections that Maduro organized to boost his powers.\u000a\u000aDespite the strains, however, neither the PCP nor the Left Bloc have much interest in breaking up the governing partnership, which is popularly nicknamed the geringonça, or contraption.\u000a\u000aIf they rock the boat too much, they risk being shunted away from power in new elections, given that polls show the PS within reach of an absolute majority, and voters would likely penalize any party that provokes a crisis by pulling out of the governing deal.\u000a\u000aThat strengthens Costa\u2019s hand in the budget talks.\u000a\u000aThe local elections will choose mayors and councillors for the country\u2019s 308 municipalities and over 3,000 smaller parish councils. Races are often dominated by local issues and personalities, but the vote will be a barometer of national support for the parties and their leaders.\u000a\u000aCosta is hoping the Socialists will increase their current leadership of 150 municipalities, and most of all they want to hang on to Lisbon, where he served as a popular mayor before stepping down in 2015 to run for the premiership.\u000a\u000aFernando Medina, Costa\u2019s successor as mayor, has been riding on a tourism boom, investing in a spate of urban embellishment projects to give the capital a facelift. The party\u2019s national ratings have also been boosted by strong economic data.\u000a\u000aLatest Eurostat numbers released last week showed Portugal\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below the eurozone average for the first time since the crisis; growth, which is predicted at over 2.5 percent this year, will be the \u201cbest this century,\u201d according to Costa; and 2017 is on course to be the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for tourist numbers.\u000a\u000aThe PSD\u2019s challenge hasn\u2019t started well. It\u2019s challenger in the Lisbon mayoral race, Teresa Leal Coelho, made a gaffe-plagued opening to her campaign \u2014 confusing Passos Coelho with a previous party leader; making promises to abolish taxes that are beyond the mayor\u2019s remit; and releasing campaign posters apparently missing their slogans.\u000a\u000aThe party has also suffered a high-profile spat over Passos Coelho\u2019s refusal to disown a candidate running in the commuter town of Loures who spouted pejorative remarks about the local Roma community.\u000a\u000aRivals within the PSD have been sharpening their knives for Passos Coelho ever since he lost the premiership in 2015. A poor showing in October could see the former prime minister ousted.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.

aVDanny Tarkanian participates in a Republican debate for Nevada's 3rd Congressional District in Henderson, Nev. on April 26, 2016. | John Locher/AP Heller gets GOP primary challenger in Nevada Danny Tarkanian announced his bid on 'Fox and Friends,"'where he criticized Heller as a 'Never-Trumper.'\u000a\u000aDanny Tarkanian, the son of a legendary Nevada college basketball coach who has run for office several times, announced Tuesday morning that he will challenge Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada's Republican primary next year.\u000a\u000aTarkanian announced his bid on "Fox & Friends," where he criticized Heller as a "Never-Trumper" and said that his stance on the president helped Hillary Clinton carry the state.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"So many people have contacted me in the past few months, saying 'You got to run against Dean Heller,'" Tarkanian said. "They understand, like I do, that we're never going to make America great again unless we have senators in office supporting President Trump. Dean Heller wasn't just one of the first Never-Trumpers in the state of Nevada, he was one of the most influential.

aVAt first glance, the past week in Washington looks like a lot of noise about nothing. Three versions of the Republican Obamacare repeal effort failed in the Senate, the last in a dramatic early morning vote Friday, leaving the national health care law intact after months of GOP efforts to kill it. President Donald Trump surprised Pentagon officials by tweeting that he was banning transgender troops from the military, but neither the White House nor the Department of Defense appears to have a policy in place, so the status quo holds for now. And despite Trump\u2019s social-media war on his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions remains in his job.\u000a\u000aStill, behind the blizzard of White House infighting and drama on Capitol Hill, the Trump administration has steadily been pushing policies behind the scenes, rolling back Obama\u2019s legacy in favor of a new national regulatory regime friendlier to businesses and tougher on undocumented immigrants. Here\u2019s the eighth installment of The Agenda\u2019s weekly series on how Trump is quietly changing policy in America.\u000a\u000a1. Trump targets Obama\u2019s fuel economy standards\u000a\u000aOn January 13, Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency attempted to lock in its 2022-2025 fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, issuing a finding that wasn\u2019t due for another 15 months. The goal was clear: block Trump from weakening the standards. But this week, the Trump administration made clear that those standards aren\u2019t going to last.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began the process to write fuel efficiency regulations for years 2022-2025, seeking comment on an upcoming environmental review. Within the notice, the agency also offered clear signs that it is likely to weaken Obama\u2019s fuel economy standards: It is considering freezing the fuel efficiency targets, instead of raising them each year as the Obama administration had proposed. It may also go back a year and review the 2021 fuel efficiency standards, which NHTSA issued in 2012.\u000a\u000aHow can NHTSA issue new fuel efficiency standards if the EPA already issued them in January? Because the standards are, in fact, a dual effort between the EPA and NHTSA; the EPA issues a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks while NHTSA issues a rule on fuel efficiency. So while the EPA attempted to lock in the 2022-2025 standards through its January rule, NHTSA must still go through a full rule-making process on its own to set the fuel economy standards, giving Trump an opening to weaken those rules. And it appears he\u2019s going to do just that.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. DOJ takes another swing at sanctuary cities\u000a\u000aFor Sessions, the week was dominated by Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on his job performance and questions about whether the president was setting the gears in motion to fire him. But at the Department of Justice, he was busy implementing Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, imposing new restrictions on so-called sanctuary cities\u2014states and localities that refuse to help the feds enforce immigration laws.\u000a\u000aThe new policy, released Tuesday, imposes new restrictions on cities that receive certain grants from the DOJ. Cities that seek money under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program\u2014known as \u201cByrne JAG\u201d\u2014must comply with two new conditions: They must give officials at the Department of Homeland Security at least 48 hours notice before releasing an undocumented immigrant from custody, and allow DHS authorities to visit state and local jails.\u000a\u000aThe new policy is Trump\u2019s first real attempt to crack down on sanctuary cities, a top campaign promise. With $347 million in funding this year, the Byrne JAG program is the largest federal grant for state and local law enforcement; cutting funding to sanctuary cities could leave a real budgetary hole for police departments. Will that actually happen? Political leaders of many sanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and Chicago, have already said they won\u2019t change their immigration policies based on the new threat; they are also certain to sue the DOJ, arguing that the coercive use of grants is an unconstitutional use of government power. Like nearly all of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, the fate of his sanctuary city effort will likely be decided by the courts.\u000a\u000a3. Obama\u2019s overtime rule is in trouble\u000a\u000aIn May 2016, Vice President Joe Biden announced a huge expansion of the Department of Labor\u2019s overtime rule, which requires employers to pay employees time-and-a-half their regular wages for more than 40 hours of work. The revised rule expanded the definition for who qualified for overtime pay and raised the salary threshold under which most workers are required to receive overtime, from $23,660 to $47,476. The effort represented a top second-term priority for Obama\u2014a unilateral attempt to give American workers a raise.\u000a\u000aBut businesses hated the rule and sued the administration over it; when Obama left office, the rule hadn\u2019t taken effect and remained in legal limbo. This week, the Trump administration sent a strong message that it will never take effect: The Labor Department kicked off the process to rewrite the rule, publishing a \u201crequest for information\u201d that seeks comments from the public about further changes. The notice wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise, since last month, the Trump administration declined to support the rule in a legal brief it filed in the ongoing lawsuit. But Tuesday\u2019s news still represents the clearest sign that the Trump DOL doesn\u2019t support Obama\u2019s overtime rule and intends to roll it back.\u000a\u000a4. Repealing Obama\u2019s fracking rule\u000a\u000aIn March 2015, the Interior Department released a high-profile rule governing hydraulic fracturing on public lands. The process, known as \u201cfracking,\u201d involves pumping millions of gallons of water into the earth to release oil and gas; it has helped make the U.S. one of the world\u2019s leading oil and gas producers, but environmentalists have criticized it for worsening climate change, polluting groundwater and causing earthquakes. The rule was intended to impose stronger safety measures on fracking on public lands, requiring producers to safely store waste fluids and disclose what chemicals they use.\u000a\u000aBut the rule never actually took effect, due to lawsuits from the oil and gas industry. Now, it\u2019s on the verge of death. The Interior Department on Monday released a 33-page proposed rule to repeal the fracking regulation, saying the Obama-era rule was \u201cunnecessarily duplicative of state and some tribal regulations and imposes burdensome reporting requirements and other unjustified costs on the oil and gas industry.\u201d The agency is accepting comments for 60 days and will release a final rule soon thereafter. But it\u2019s clear how this will end: The fracking rule is dead.\u000a\u000a5. Ending an Obama retirement program\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the Treasury Department created a new way for Americans to save for retirement, allowing people without access to a workplace retirement plan to open a starter account, known as a \u201cmyRA.\u201d It was designed to encourage all Americans to save for retirement\u2014without fees\u2014and participants could contribute up to $5,500 a year from pre-tax earnings, a savings account or a federal tax refund.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration heavily promoted the program, but myRA never garnered much interest: Only about 20,000 people have opened accounts since it launched at the end of 2015. On Friday, the Treasury Department announced it was shutting down the myRA program; participants\u2019 funds would be transitioned into Roth IRA accounts. The death of myRA isn\u2019t a huge deal, given the limited enrollment. But Friday\u2019s news still marks the end of a top Obama effort to expand retirement savings opportunities.

aVGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen | Lennart Preiss/Getty Images German minister says government not pandering to Trump \u2018Germany keeps its promise,\u2019 Ursula von der Leyen said after promising to increase defense spending.\u000a\u000aGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen dismissed claims that the government was pandering to U.S. President Donald Trump by agreeing to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, local media reported Monday.\u000a\u000aMartin Schulz, the head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Angela Merkel\u2019s challenger for the German chancellorship, and Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the SPD\u2019s parliamentary group, wrote an op-ed in Funke Mediengruppe newspapers Sunday in which they rejected the 2 percent of GDP defense-spending target backed by NATO members.\u000a\u000aBut Von der Leyen said increased defense spending was necessary for Europe\u2019s security and to help Berlin keep its word.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermany keeps its promise,\u201d the defense minister said, adding that its European neighbors would expect just that.\u000a\u000aVon der Leyen said the SPD\u2019s assertions were part of a \u201ctotally messed up election campaign\u201d and blindsided German soldiers and Germany\u2019s allies.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, the SPD chiefs accused Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of pandering to Trump, who has frequently blasted NATO countries that don\u2019t meet the 2 percent spending target.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe say a clear no to the 2 percent target of Trump,\u201d and to the CDU and its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, wrote Schulz and Oppermann. They said Merkel and the conservatives had responded to Trump\u2019s \u201cprovocations\u201d on defense spending \u201cwith an \u2018OK, then there\u2019s more money from us,\u2019 as if we had nothing better to do with our money.\u201d\u000a\u000aVon der Leyen said Germany currently contributes 1.26 percent of its GDP to defense, and she wants to reach the 2 percent target by 2024. But Schulz said that would require almost doubling the current spending level of \u20ac37 billion, making Germany the largest military force in Europe.\u000a\u000aThe defense minister said if the SPD opposes increased funding for the armed forces, they would also be opposing the modernization of the military and increases in personnel and resources.\u000a\u000aSchulz and Oppermann criticized Von der Leyen, saying she was responsible for equipment problems and accusing her of lacking leadership. They said military spending increases should be matched with increased funds for diplomacy, crisis prevention and humanitarian initiatives, but warned the world wouldn\u2019t want Germany to be the largest military power in Europe \u201cbecause of our past.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe SPD trails the CDU by double-digits in the polls, with the election on September 24.

aVIn the days before Hillary Clinton launched an unprecedented big-money fundraising vehicle with state parties last summer, she vowed \u201cto rebuild our party from the ground up,\u201d proclaiming \u201cwhen our state parties are strong, we win. That\u2019s what will happen."\u000a\u000aBut less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by that effort has stayed in the state parties\u2019 coffers, according to a POLITICO analysis of the latest Federal Election Commission filings.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe venture, the Hillary Victory Fund, is a so-called joint fundraising committee comprised of Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees. The setup allows Clinton to solicit checks of $350,000 or more from her super-rich supporters at extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney\u2019s house and a concert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton John.\u000a\u000aThe victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO\u2019s analysis of the FEC records found.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton\u2019s campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton\u2019s campaign if and when she becomes the party\u2019s nominee. And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton\u2019s campaign, including $2.8 million for \u201csalary and overhead\u201d and $8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.\u000a\u000aThe arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and allies of Clinton\u2019s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. They see it as a circumvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus intent on doing whatever it takes to help Clinton defeat Sanders during the party\u2019s primary, and then win the White House.\u000a\u000aBut it is perhaps more notable that the arrangement has prompted concerns among some participating state party officials and their allies. They grumble privately that Clinton is merely using them to subsidize her own operation, while her allies overstate her support for their parties and knock Sanders for not doing enough to help the party.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a one-sided benefit,\u201d said an official with one participating state party. The official, like those with several other state parties, declined to talk about the arrangement on the record for fear of drawing the ire of the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the DNC, which has pushed back aggressively on charges that it is boosting Clinton at the expense of other Democrats, has advised state party officials on how to answer media inquiries about the arrangement, multiple sources familiar with the interactions told POLITICO.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe DNC has given us some guidance on what they\u2019re saying, but it\u2019s not clear what we should be saying,\u201d said the official. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party because we do need their resources. But everyone who entered into these agreements was doing it because they were asked to, not because there are immediately clear benefits.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state parties. They worry that participating states that aren\u2019t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Senate races could see very little return investment from the DNC or Clinton\u2019s campaign, and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for them. And for party committees in contested states, there\u2019s another risk: They might find themselves unable to accept cash from rich donors whose checks to the victory fund counted toward their $10,000 donation limit to the state party in question \u2014 even if that party never got to spend the cash because it was transferred to the DNC.\u000a\u000aSources working with the Hillary Victory Fund said the committee is sensitive to these concerns and that state parties were asked to submit names of donors they wanted to save for themselves.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC argue that all Democratic politicians and state parties \u2014 even those that aren\u2019t enrolled in the victory fund \u2014 will benefit from its fundraising. That\u2019s because the cash will go toward enhancing national voter data, and research and communications efforts that all state parties are entitled to.\u000a\u000aAnd Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, suggested that a handful of key state parties last month received another $700,000 in transfers from the victory fund, and enjoyed other benefits from it that will be detailed in subsequent FEC reports. (The latest reports cover only through the end of March.)\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout $4.5 million has already been transferred to state parties and there is an additional $9 million on hand that will be distributed over the coming months as state parties ramp up for the general election,\u201d he said in an email. He added that in April, \u201cmoney raised through the HVF has started to be used to fund Democratic coordinated campaigns across the country, which will help strengthen the party and elect Democrats up and down the ballot.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Schwerin did not respond to follow-up questions about how much of the $700,000 in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently transferred to the DNC.\u000a\u000aDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed out that the national party committee \u201coffered to engage in the same joint fundraising efforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle, and we welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in November.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders' campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, but the committee has been largely inactive. Instead, after Sanders was chided by Clinton allies for not helping down-ballot Democrats, he sent out appeals to his vaunted email list that helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a trio of progressive House candidates, who got to keep all the cash.\u000a\u000aThe Hillary Victory Fund, by contrast, allows the Clinton campaign to maintain tight control over the cash it raises and spends. The fund represents by far the most ambitious use to date of a joint fundraising committee \u2014 and arguably one of the most ambitious hard-dollar fundraising efforts in modern presidential politics. Until 2014, the most an individual could have given to such a committee was $123,200. But in April of that year, the Supreme Court, in a case called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor wanted.\u000a\u000aThat paved the way for massive joint fundraising committees that could accept ever-larger checks based on the number and type of committees that agreed to participate. In the case of the Hillary Victory Fund, the maximum donation in 2016 is $356,100, based on maximum donations of $2,700 to Hillary for America for the primary election, $33,400 to the DNC and $10,000 to the federal accounts of each of the 32 state parties.\u000a\u000aAfter POLITICO revealed that the victory fund was asking for couples to donate or raise a whopping $353,400 in order to sit at a table with Clinton, Clooney and his wife, attorney Amal Clooney, at a fundraiser last month in San Francisco, Clooney admitted that was "an obscene amount of money." But he justified it by saying "the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket."\u000a\u000aAccording to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which were obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the participants. The first $2,700 goes to the Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties.\u000a\u000aBut what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating officer, Beth Jones, is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the DNC, which Sanders\u2019 supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton campaign.\u000a\u000aFor example, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party received $43,500 from the victory fund on Nov. 2, only to transfer the same amount to the DNC that same day. The pattern repeated itself after the Minnesota party received transfers from the victory fund of $20,600 on Dec. 1 (the party sent the same amount to the DNC the next day) and $150,000 on Jan. 4 (it transferred the same amount to the DNC that day).\u000a\u000aThat means that Minnesota\u2019s net gain from its participation in the victory fund was precisely $0 through the end of March. Meanwhile, the DNC pocketed an extra $214,100 in cash routed through Minnesota \u2014 much of which the DNC wouldn\u2019t have been able to accept directly, since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee.\u000a\u000aA similar pattern transpired with most of the participating state parties. As of March 31, only eight state parties (most of which were in battleground states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia) had received more from the victory fund than was transferred from their accounts to the DNC.\u000a\u000aBut even if state parties aren\u2019t getting to keep the victory fund cash, they benefit from money spent to enhance the DNC\u2019s data, research and design services, said Jeremy Kennedy, the executive director of the Maine Democratic State Committee, which is a victory fund participant.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn my opinion, strengthening the state parties strengthens the DNC and vice versa,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019d be the first one to tell you if I felt differently.\u201d His party received $59,800 from the victory fund, but transferred that exact amount to the DNC, though Kennedy said he hopes that money will find its way back to benefit the party in Maine.\u000a\u000aWhile state party officials were made aware that Clinton's campaign would control the movement of the funds between participating committees, one operative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of their officials have complained that they weren't notified of the transfers into and out of their accounts until after the fact. That's despite their stipulations in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required before such transfers could be made from their accounts. But the operative said that the state party officials are reluctant to complain to the DNC about the arrangement out of fear of financial retribution.\u000a\u000a\u201cParticularly the parties in states that are not competitive, they worry that the DNC won\u2019t let them keep any of the money, but the historical reality is that they wouldn\u2019t have gotten the money anyway,\u201d the operative said.\u000a\u000aAsked about whether the victory fund has taken steps to keep the state parties apprised of the transfers, Schwerin said, \u201cWe work closely with all parties involved and all transfers occur in accordance with the joint fundraising agreements.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmalgamated Bank \u2014 the union-run bank that handles the accounts for the victory fund, as well as Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC \u2014 did not directly address the complaints about money being transferred without consent of the state party committees.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do not comment on the account activity of any customers other than to say that all clients enjoy the highest standards of security protocols and safeguards to ensure only listed account owners or their designated agents are able to execute transactions of any kind and, of course, always in full compliance of all banking laws,\u201d said bank spokesman Loren Riegelhaupt.\u000a\u000aAnother area in which critics contend the Hillary Victory Fund appears to be pushing the bounds of joint fundraising is in its online advertising campaign, which has included many ads urging readers to \u201cStop Trump\u201d or to support Clinton.\u000a\u000aWhile joint fundraising committees are allowed to pay for ads as part of their fundraising efforts, they are forbidden from funding campaign advertising urging voters to vote for or against specific candidates. Those types of ads qualify as electioneering expenses that are supposed to be paid for directly by the campaign or by party committees.\u000a\u000aSchwerin said the \u201cStop Trump\u201d ads aren\u2019t urging readers to vote against Trump. \u201cAll of HVF's activities, including online ads, are for fundraising purposes,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMost of the victory funds ads were executed by the same firm that does advertising for Clinton\u2019s campaign, Bully Pulpit Interactive, which has been paid $8.6 million by the Hillary Victory Fund for online advertising, and $9.2 million by Hillary for America for online advertising and media buys.\u000a\u000aThose victory fund ads, as well as a direct mail campaign funded by the same committee, \u201cappear to benefit only [the Clinton campaign] by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees,\u201d charged Sanders\u2019 campaign lawyer in an open letter sent to the DNC in April. It alleged that the victory fund was essentially a pass-through to allow Clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally accept.\u000a\u000aIn a news release accompanying the letter, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver argued \u201cit is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest.\u201d\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook called the letter a \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d fundraising ploy, and urged Sanders to \u201cthink about what he can do to help the party he is seeking to lead.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVNo wonder Belgium is panicking.\u000a\u000aA snowballing health scandal over a poisonous insecticide in eggs has revived the specter of a massive political crisis in 1999 that brought down the government.\u000a\u000aBelgium will convene an emergency session of ministers in parliament Wednesday to determine whether it can still rely on the food safety apparatus created nearly 20 years ago to prevent a rerun of the dioxin crisis, which is now etched into Belgians\u2019 memories.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, toxic dioxins entered the food chain through animal feed via an oil and fat recycling company in Flanders: Vetsmelter Verkest. Health authorities sat on the information for months, leading to accusations from then-opposition leader Guy Verhofstadt of a premeditated cover-up. Ministers resigned, shoppers panicked, demand for dairy products dried up and pigs were slaughtered. Neighboring countries lambasted Belgium\u2019s opacity and France banned a wide range of Belgian food items.\u000a\u000aFast forward two decades, and Belgium is again in the thick of it, and many of the same problems of poor communication are re-emerging, with Germany especially furious about the lack of information it is receiving.\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aThe latest crisis hinges on a poison called fipronil that has contaminated eggs across several EU countries, thanks to an illegal mite-killing detergent for chickens made by a company in Flanders called Poultry Vision. While tests identifying a \u201cserious\u201d risk were first conducted in May and an investigation was opened in June, the public was only informed at the end of July, and then only because of concerns in the Netherlands. Across the EU, hundreds of farms have closed and sales of tens of millions of eggs have been halted.\u000a\u000aFipronil can damage organs ranging from the liver to the thyroid gland, and it\u2019s especially harmful to children.\u000a\u000aBelgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme and Health Minister Maggie De Block will try to explain Belgium\u2019s handling of the crisis to parliamentarians Wednesday. Ducarme has called for a detailed report from Belgium\u2019s Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) and prioritized consumer safety.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission said Monday that seven countries may be affected.\u000a\u000aGermany, which fears it has imported millions of contaminated eggs, is the most vocal critic. Regional officials angrily accused the Belgians of not picking up the phone and of not being \u201cup to the job.\u201d The agriculture ministry in Berlin said Christian Schmidt, Germany\u2019s farm minister, called his Belgian counterpart Monday to demand \u201ca fast and complete clarification of the ongoing situation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTurbid timeline\u000a\u000aMuch of the appraisal of the scandal will hinge on its messy chronology.\u000a\u000aAFSCA said it was informed in early June that traces of fipronil had made it into the food chain via eggs. But the agency failed to notify its partners in Europe of the scandal for nearly two months.\u000a\u000aThe frustration with the Belgian authorities is shaping into the biggest black mark against the country\u2019s administration since its intelligence networks were widely accused, especially by French President François Hollande, of failing to identify the terrorist networks behind attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aAccording to an official notification form filed by the Belgian state, the sampling of the contaminated eggs took place May 15. However it wasn\u2019t until July 20 that Belgium informed its European partners via the EU\u2019s so-called Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Only on August 1 did AFSCA make its first public announcement on the issue.\u000a\u000aKatrien Stragier, a spokesperson AFSCA, said the May 15 date referred to the day that a private egg producer in Belgium conducted its own tests to check for fipronil. It was not until early June that AFSCA was informed.\u000a\u000aThijs Verbeurgt, head of the policy unit for the Flemish Social-Democratic Party, said \u201cThe big question is who knew what when.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been feeling is that they [Belgium\u2019s food safety authority] took a minimalist approach, minimal [communication] and minimal action, while in the Netherlands and Germany they\u2019ve been taking maximal steps,\u201d Verbeurgt said. \u201cThat means destroying eggs and chickens in the interests of the consumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aQuestions about measuring egg safety\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aIn Germany\u2019s view, dangerous eggs have been found in Belgium. According to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany, Belgian eggs have recorded fipronil levels of between 0.0031 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg. Only eggs with a fipronil level of up to 0.72 mg/kg are considered safe for human consumption.\u000a\u000aBut Belgium says there is no danger. On Monday, AFSCA said test results from 21 egg-producing businesses showed a maximum level of fipronil recorded of only 0.096 mg/kg.\u000a\u000aAsked why Belgian authorities had not used the 1.2 mg/kg result, Stragier explained that figure was from the private producer and not from AFSCA\u2019s data. \u201cWe base our analysis on the results that we see in the analysis we have done here in Belgium. We\u2019ve done our own analysis and taken samples of companies which are suspected of having used fipronil, and the results indicate that there is no health risk in Belgium,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGermany also complained that the context of 1.2 mg/kg reading was not properly explained by the Belgian authorities.\u000a\u000aAndreas Tief, spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, said that when Belgium finally did inform other countries, authorities said there was no risk to other nations. They didn\u2019t tell EU countries about Poultry Vision\u2019s tainted DEGA-16 detergent.\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir message was that neighboring countries were not concerned and they did not inform us about DEGA-16,\u201d Tief said.\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater.\u000a\u000aAnd poor communication isn\u2019t helping.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe federal [agriculture] minister has not only spoken publicly about problems in the cooperation. He has also had talks on the highest levels with Belgian counterparts,\u201d Tief said. \u201cThat gives you a sense of how things are going.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater. The Hague declared eggs from 59 producers to be unfit for consumption by children.\u000a\u000aBenno Bruggink, a spokesperson for the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, said that any time fipronil levels rise above 0.72 mg/kg the authorities will issue a public warning.\u000a\u000aAsked if the approach in the Netherlands was of a more precautionary nature when compared to Belgium, he said: \u201cIt would seem so.\u201d

aVNorth Korea\u2019s hackers already stand accused of disrupting South Korean power plants, trashing Sony Pictures\u2019 computers and stealing $81 million from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank. But if they also caused this past week\u2019s global cyber meltdown, the reclusive regime\u2019s cyber operatives may have finally gone too far.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s because the spreading malware crisis\u2019 hardest-hit victims include China \u2014 the country that some cybersecurity experts say has enabled North Korea\u2019s hacking operations by providing network bandwidth and even physical space for thousands of Pyongyang digital warriors to launch attacks on government and corporate computer systems around the world.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAnd that has security advocates hoping that Beijing will finally slap down its aggressive neighbor, something the U.S. has been seeking in vain for years.\u000a\u000aThe North Koreans \u201cgenerally don\u2019t pick on their benefactor,\u201d said John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at the cybersecurity company Fidelis, which uncovered suspected digital links between North Korea and the malware blanketing the world.\u000a\u000aBut the wave of so-called ransomware attacks that began Friday have struck China hard, locking up computer networks at government agencies and universities and demanding ransom payments to release them. If North Korea is responsible, even unintentionally, it would be the first known attempt by Pyongyang to digitally pilfer China\u2019s coffers at such a scale.\u000a\u000aThe digital strikes came as Beijing and Pyongyang were already at odds over North Korea\u2019s erratic military aggression, including a series of ballistic missile tests.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is creating a situation where China is forced to respond,\u201d said Carl Wright, executive vice president at TrapX, a cyber firm that studies malware around the globe. \u201cThese type of situations, when you combine the physical and cyber together, can definitely be a tipping point.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd if China doesn\u2019t punish North Korea, some lawmakers and security experts want the Trump administration or an international body to step in \u2014 even if that means imposing sanctions on Chinese entities and people that aid Pyongyang\u2019s hacking operations.\u000a\u000aRepublican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, the chairman of a cyber-focused Armed Services subcommittee, told POLITICO on Tuesday that conclusive proof of North Korean involvement in the ransomware campaign would \u201ccertainly strengthen those interests\u201d in imposing fresh penalties on North Korea or China over its digital assistance to Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime.\u000a\u000aSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee overseeing East Asia and international cybersecurity, sent a letter on Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council urging it to slap North Korea with fresh sanctions over both the recent missile launches and its \u201cmalicious cyber behavior.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsian experts think China may be amenable to cooperating \u2014 to an extent \u2014 if the worldwide consensus is that North Korea orchestrated the ransomware ambush.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think in this case they would be open to it,\u201d said Adam Segal, a China cyber specialist with the Council on Foreign Relations, adding that Beijing might respond to the threat of U.S. sanctions targeting its banking system.\u000a\u000aBut that cooperation would only go so far, Segal and others cautioned. China\u2019s primary goal, they said, is to maintain stability in North Korea and to eradicate the nuclear uncertainty that is quickly pervading the region.\u000a\u000aMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

But \u201cthey're going to be finely tuned.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re always very careful not to go too far,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aA Chinese rebuke could involve expelling North Korean hackers or axing Pyongyang\u2019s access to China\u2019s robust internet, steps that some believe would severely derail the boxed-in country's ability to conduct its digital rampages. Bambenek estimated China could set back Pyongyang\u2019s cyber program six to 12 months.\u000a\u000aWithout China as a staging ground, North Korea would have to find another willing partner, scour the black market for tools, or develop its own technology. Each option would put Pyongyang\u2019s hackers at greater risk of getting caught, several cyber experts said.\u000a\u000aBut Jenny Jun, co-author of a Center for Strategic and International Studies report on North Korea\u2019s digital programs, said Pyongyang may have left behind its digital reliance on China in recent years as the once tech-averse country\u2019s hacking skills matured.\u000a\u000aMuch of the evidence of Chinese digital aid to North Korea \u2014 tacitly allowing North Korean hackers to work from a Chinese hotel, or letting Chinese-based companies operate as fronts for the development of digital intrusion tools \u2014 is based on years-old research. And the tools behind the country\u2019s more recent digital ambushes, such as the Sony Pictures strike from late 2014, were developed in-house, Jun said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is entirely possible they have moved their base to other Southeast Asian countries, with their [internet addresses] just routed or spoofed across different countries,\u201d Jun said.\u000a\u000aGiven the lack of concrete information on North Korea, the reality is difficult to ascertain, researchers agreed.\u000a\u000aThus far in China, though, the state-controlled media has kept the focus elsewhere \u2014 on the general scourge of cybercrime, or the U.S. spy community\u2019s role in the outbreak, according to Segal. The hackers behind the digital extortion campaign used a flaw in Microsoft Windows that the National Security Agency had apparently exploited for years \u2014 until someone leaked the NSA\u2019s hacking tools online and allowed cyber criminals to copy them.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese government itself has stayed mostly silent, Segal added.\u000a\u000aIt could take months before other governments are willing to officially point the finger at North Korea, upping the pressure on China. Assigning blame for cyberattacks is notoriously difficult, and the digital evidence so far \u2014 some overlapping code between malware that powered the global attacks and tools used by a North Korean-linked hacking group \u2014 is far from conclusive.\u000a\u000aEven if China decides to act in concert with international partners to stymie North Korea\u2019s digital ambitions, the public may never know. Beijing is doggedly committed to retaining its relationship with Pyongyang, regional experts said.\u000a\u000aThe two countries operate \u201cwithin a narrow band of good relations and bad relations,\u201d Wit said.\u000a\u000aBut, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s always relations.\u201d\u000a\u000aMartin Matishak contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVSince President Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed the immigration bill proposed by Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, various politicians of all stripes have condemned it. They\u2019ve accused the bill of being undemocratic, un-American and economically unsound. Many have confidently asserted that more immigrants are always better than fewer.\u000a\u000aThis rush to judgment is way over the top, and largely uninformed. The current immigration system is desperately in need of reform, and a careful examination of the proposal shows that not only would it likely create substantial economic gains for the country in the long term, it would also eliminate elements of our current policy that are hard to defend.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aFirst, some background: Despite the dramatic economic changes that the United States experienced in recent decades, the regulation of legal immigration still operates under a system devised back in 1965. This system, which lets in about 1 million legal immigrants a year, favors foreign relatives of current residents\u2014without regard to qualifications. About two-thirds of all legal immigrants enter under these family preferences. Only about 15 percent enter under so-called employment preferences, typically granted to persons who are \u201cpriority workers\u201d or embody other types of desirable skills. The exact rules that determine whether a worker qualifies to be part of this 15 percent are unclear to those uninitiated in the intricacies of immigration law.\u000a\u000aThis is where the Cotton-Perdue proposal, also known as the RAISE Act, comes in. They propose two major shifts in existing policy. One tries to address the question of how many immigrants should come into the country. The other answers the question of which applicants we should let in\u2014through a complete rewrite of the rules for skill-based immigration.\u000a\u000aThe rule changes for skill-based immigration should not be controversial. If nothing else, the proposal introduces much-needed transparency in identifying which types of workers we seek. The Cotton-Perdue bill would divvy up the 140,000 visas now assigned to the employment preferences by using a point system similar to those adopted and used for several decades in other countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In rough terms, those point systems essentially grade visa applicants on the basis of personal characteristics, such as education, occupation and age; add up the points, and grant an entry visa to those who \u201cpass the test.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Cotton-Perdue bill contains an extremely detailed formula for granting points. The bill gives more points to those who are young. More points to those who are proficient in English as measured by the score in an actual exam. More points to those with professional degrees or degrees in science and technology. And more points to those who have won prizes that signal exceptional ability in specific areas. An Olympic medal, for example, will get you 15 points; a Nobel Prize, 25.\u000a\u000aIn short, the bill provides a clear and transparent framework for determining which types of workers we believe to be most beneficial. And I suspect that most Americans would view the Cotton-Perdue approach as common sense. Do many of us really believe that America would benefit more by letting in a sociology professor in her 50s than by letting in a young woman with an advanced degree in computer science?\u000a\u000aAnd why exactly is this type of merit-based visa allocation such a good thing from an economic perspective? Despite all the disagreement that economists have over the details of the economic impact of immigration, there is little, if any, disagreement about the fact that high-skill immigration benefits the United States far more than low-skill immigration.\u000a\u000aHigh-skill immigrants are more complementary to America\u2019s existing productive infrastructure. High-skill immigrants pay more in taxes and receive fewer services. Exceptional high-skill immigrants will introduce knowledge and abilities that we will learn from, making us more productive, and expanding the frontier of what is economically possible in our country. And high-skill immigration, unlike low-skill immigration, will reduce, rather than increase, income inequality. In fact, the people who will lose out the most from the Cotton-Perdue proposal are the high-skill workers in STEM fields, both native and foreign-born, who are here already. They will now have to compete with many more qualified workers for available jobs.\u000a\u000aThe RAISE Act point system according to a senate PowerPoint file made available by Senator Cotton\u2019s office.\u000a\u000aBut there is no need to believe any of these arguments to see the pros of high-skill immigration. Whether we like it or not, there is already a global market for high-skill immigrants, with various countries adopting policies designed to persuade the potential migrant to move there. Just look at the policies that other immigrant-receiving countries pursue. Many already have point systems to filter the applicant pool, or they have put other policies into place that do the same thing, like the \u201cblue card\u201d in the European Union, giving preference to high-skill applicants. All these countries know something that the United States, to its detriment, has ignored for several decades: High-skill immigration is economically more profitable.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the Cotton-Perdue proposal is so pragmatic that it essentially predicts its own demise. Given the strong emotions that permeate and dominate the immigration debate, it is unlikely that anything as logical, rational and economically sensible could possibly become law.\u000a\u000aThe other part of the Cotton-Perdue proposal is bound to be much more controversial, as it involves a cut in the number of legal immigrants admitted through the family preference system. As it stands, the system entitles immigrants in the United States to bring in their relatives. This entitlement extends not only to relatives like spouses and minor children, but also to adult family members, such as the immigrant\u2019s parents and siblings.\u000a\u000aJust think for a minute about what that means. A newly arrived immigrant can eventually bring in his or her sibling. That sibling will then be able to bring in his or her spouse. But the sibling\u2019s spouse will eventually be able to bring in the sibling\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents and siblings, and on and on.\u000a\u000aIt is this multiplier effect that the Cotton-Perdue proposal wants to eliminate by getting rid of the entitlement granted to immigrants to bring in their parents, adult children, and siblings. (Preference would still be given to minor children and spouses of immigrants.) But before dismissing the proposal outright, it is worth asking ourselves: Does it really make sense to have a policy that eventually guarantees an entry visa to the immigrant\u2019s brother\u2018s wife\u2018s father\u2018s sister?\u000a\u000aBecause of the ever-expanding number of potential immigrants created by the current policy, its repeal would have a large impact on the total number of immigrants admitted to the country. In about a decade, legal immigration would be cut by about half, bringing the level of immigration down to what we had back in the 1980s. (The Cotton-Perdue bill also discontinues the lottery that raffles out around 50,000 visas a year, but it is the repeal of the siblings and adult family preferences that would have the largest numerical impact.)\u000a\u000aSome critics, like Senator Lindsey Graham, have already objected to the cut by claiming that the country needs continued high levels of low-skill immigration. As the narrative goes, immigrants do jobs that natives don\u2019t want to do. But many news reports this summer provide anecdotal evidence that this claim is hogwash. Some of Trump\u2019s immigration initiatives have left employers scrambling to fill jobs with native workers. And how exactly are they addressing the labor shortage? By offering higher wages and working conditions. It\u2019s not that immigrants do jobs that natives don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s that immigrants do jobs that natives don\u2019t want to do at the going wage.\u000a\u000aOther critics of the Cotton-Perdue bill feel that selecting people on the basis of their economic potential is not what the United States is all about. And many also feel that immigration is always a good thing\u2014so that more immigration is always better than less.\u000a\u000aAnd, indeed, human beings are more than just economic animals. Detractors will surely cite the \u201cgive me your tired, your poor\u201d lines from the Emma Lazarus poem as proof that immigration to the United States is not simply about how rich the country can get. And those critics have a point\u2014a point I sympathize with. The United States has been historically exceptional in its generosity, welcoming many of the huddled masses with little economic potential. And there\u2019s something about this generosity that should make all of us proud to be Americans.\u000a\u000aI have much less sympathy, however, with the rigid belief that more immigration must always be better than less immigration. Despite the thousands of published studies that examine the economic impact of immigration, not a single one provides a credible estimate of what the \u201coptimal\u201d number of immigrants should be, the magic number that maximizes our wealth.\u000a\u000aIf anyone\u2014even someone claiming to be an economic expert\u2014tells you that the science is settled and that economics implies that the correct number of immigrants is x, that so-called expert is flat-out lying. And even if we were able to come up with a magic number based purely on economics, it wouldn\u2019t take into account how that number might affect our schools, our neighborhoods, our culture, our safety and our politics. Let\u2019s try to be humble for a change. We simply do not know if 1 million legal immigrants per year is too few or too many.\u000a\u000aI happen to believe that 1 million legal immigrants per year is probably\u2014and I do mean probably, as I\u2019m not really sure\u2014larger than the magic number. But this belief has little to do with economic studies or expert opinion. It is the lesson I\u2019ve learned from reading the news and following the political debate over immigration for three decades.\u000a\u000aThink about it: Would we be arguing so much about immigration if every American had benefited greatly from it? I doubt it. Surely, immigration made some of us richer, but that additional wealth was not equally shared, and more than a few Americans were left behind.\u000a\u000aI recall how back in the early 1980s, at the time I first began to work on immigration, few people cared about my work because few people cared about immigration. Unfortunately, immigration has now become an all-consuming political hot potato, doing its best to polarize us and divide us. The contentious and divisive debate suggests to me that more than a few Americans feel that immigration has made them worse off and that we should cut back a bit to improve the lives of those left behind in the maelstrom.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s no need to rely on what I\u2019ve learned to get the point. Just look at how immigration has destabilized the political consensus in the United States and Europe. What does that tell you about the long-term political and social consequences of large-scale immigration?\u000a\u000aMany of the people who will argue that the cuts in the Cotton-Perdue proposal make for bad policy subscribe to the notion that immigration is good for everyone, and that more immigration is obviously better. Unfortunately, they forget the old maxim that there\u2019s no free lunch, and that even immigration is not an exception to that rule. Low-skill immigration, which would likely suffer the largest cuts in the proposed bill, imposes costs on taxpayers, and it imposes costs on low-skill workers already here.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not as if low-skill workers will stop coming under the Cotton-Perdue bill. The proposal leaves unchanged the family preference system as it applies to spouses and minor children. That specific provision of current policy allowed the entry of millions of low-skill persons in the past 50 years, and would continue to do so in the future. The difference now is that the larger fraction of high-skill workers coming into the country will help defray the costs of continued low-skill immigration.\u000a\u000aThe forthcoming debate over the bill would be much more productive if, instead of name-calling and accusations about motives, we focused on a simple question. Is the \u201cdeal\u201d implicit in the Cotton-Perdue bill really such a bad compromise with our historical legacy?\u000a\u000aGeorge J.
