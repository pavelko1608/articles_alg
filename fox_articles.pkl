Could his ardent hate for President Trump help him bounce back?\u000a\u000aMel Gibson couldn\u2019t get arrested in Hollywood following his oh, so famous public meltdown in 2006.\u000a\u000aThe Lethal Weapon star ranted against the Jews while being cuffed on DUI charges. It took years for Gibson to get in the industry\u2019s good graces again. He apologized repeatedly, kept a low profile and performed in some indie films before winning raves for his 2016 war film Hacksaw Ridge.\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf follow in Gibson\u2019s tainted footsteps? Or will the actor\u2019s anti-Trump performance art buffer him against a similar career catastrophe?

On Monday night, Barney, who lives with her father Simon Barney, Judge's ex-husband, posted a lengthy Facebook message saying her mother was "mentally and emotionally abusive."\u000a\u000a"The reasons I left my mothers house are that she was neglectful (leaving us at home with no food or simply ignoring us entirely), she constantly put herself first and the biggest reason was that she was mentally and emotionally abusive. She was no mother to me," the 18-year-old wrote.\u000a\u000aShe then said part of the reason her parents separated was because Judge's love for being in the spotlight.\u000a\u000a"Not even two weeks after I graduated she posted a photo of me and shared it with her one million followers knowing that it would get picked up by the press. The one thing I asked and have been asking for 4 years now has been to not talk about me because I don\u2019t want to be in the spotlight," Sidney wrote, adding that her mother disregarded her request and posted the photos anyway.\u000a\u000a"But Again breaking her promises as per usual, she puts herself, her fame, her reputation, and her bank account before me. If she really wanted a relationship she would keep her promises and recognize that it is no one else's fault but hers that I do not want her in my life," Barney said.\u000a\u000a"My mom has been portraying the innocent erased mother whose daughter was estranged from her due to divorce and an evil ex husband when in actuality she is the sole reason why I do not want her in my life and will not have a relationship with her," Barney wrote.

aVBy Fred Fleitz, Fox News\u000a\u000aTuesday's bombshell Washington Post story that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has determined North Korea is capable of constructing miniaturized nuclear weapons that could be used as warheads for missiles \u2013 possibly ICBMs \u2013 left out a crucial fact: DIA actually concluded this in 2013. The Post also failed to mention that the Obama administration tried to downplay and discredit this report at the time.\u000a\u000aDuring an April 11, 2013, House Armed Services Committee hearing, Congressman Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., inadvertently revealed several unclassified sentences from a DIA report that said DIA had determined with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that North Korea has the capability to make a nuclear weapon small enough to be launched with a ballistic missile.\u000a\u000aThe Director of National Intelligence and Obama officials subsequently tried to dismiss Lamborn\u2019s disclosure by claiming the DIA assessment was an outlier that did not reflect the views of the rest of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\u000a\u000aIt was clear what Obama officials were doing in 2013. The DIA report represented inconvenient facts that threatened President Obama\u2019s North Korea \u201cstrategic patience\u201d policy -- a policy to do nothing about North Korea and kick this problem down the road to the next president. Obama officials tried to downplay the DIA assessment to prevent it from being used to force the president to employ a more assertive North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worth noting that the Trump White House has not condemned the Washington Post story as a leak. That\u2019s probably because it was an authorized disclosure of classified information to advance President Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy. That is, instead of concealing intelligence to avoid taking action against the tough North Korea problem like the Obama administration did, the Trump administration publicized this same intelligence to demonstrate the seriousness of this threat and why decisive action by the United States is required.

aVBy Charles Lipson, Real Clear Politics\u000a\u000aQuestion 1: How serious is the North Korean crisis?\u000a\u000aAnswer: Deadly serious. It is the closest the world has come to a possible nuclear exchange since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. That crisis, you will remember, ended only after President Kennedy imposed a naval blockade (an act of war in international law) and threatened further escalation. That threat, credible as it was, led to a diplomatic solution.

aVProgressive corporations enforce an ideological monoculture. Dissent and get fired.\u000a\u000aBy David French, The National Review\u000a\u000aWhen I talk about free speech, I often ask the audience two questions. First, did you know that the Supreme Court has been steadily expanding free-speech rights? Second, do you feel freer to speak now than you did five years ago? The answers are always the same \u2014 some variation of \u201cno\u201d and \u201check, no.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe first assertion is undoubtedly true. Federal courts have consistently protected free speech from government interference and have been relentless in shutting down viewpoint discrimination. When government officials target speech because of a speaker\u2019s views, they lose time and again.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, millions of Americans are extraordinarily reluctant to express even the most mainstream of (particularly) social conservative views. They\u2019re convinced that if they do that, they\u2019ll be publicly humiliated, investigated, and perhaps even lose their jobs. They\u2019re convinced that outspoken liberals enjoy greater opportunity in key sectors of the economy, and if conservatives want to thrive, they best keep their opinions to themselves.\u000a\u000aTwo recent incidents highlight this concern. The first comes courtesy of actress Lena Dunham, the paradigm of the celebrity social-justice warrior. Early last Thursday morning, she tweeted at American Airlines that she\u2019d heard two of its employees engaged in \u201ctransphobic\u201d talk. Specifically, she said she heard two flight attendants talk about how they thought transgenderism was \u201cgross,\u201d and they\u2019d \u201cnever accept a trans kid.\u201d She did not see them harassing anyone. She was simply eavesdropping on a conversation.

Then she shows us how to overcome these left wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the topics she tackles in the book: (1) How the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom (a new Blackrock survey shows that 4 out of 10 Americans haven't even started saving for retirement)--and how to get it back; (2) How the wide-open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year--and how we can successfully navigate the system; (3)How, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored health-care coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies have begun to abandon employee health-care coverage and opt to pay a less expensive federal penalty; (4) Why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.

aVRepublican senators who have been a thorn in President Trump's side are beginning to see the political consequences of opposing the White House as pro-Trump activists start to mobilize.\u000a\u000aJust this week, it was revealed that conservative billionaire and Trump benefactor Robert Mercer would be contributing $300,000 to a super PAC supporting a primary challenger to Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. The Republican lawmaker has sparred with Trump on immigration and is promoting a book that argues the GOP is in \u201cdenial\u201d about the president.\u000a\u000aNevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller \u2013 who gave only tepid support to Trump\u2019s presidential bid and the subsequent push to repeal and replace ObamaCare \u2013 also learned this week he would face a primary challenge from a Trump backer who has run unsuccessfully for Senate before.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, too, is feeling the heat from Trump and his base as the president vents about the Kentucky Republican\u2019s inability to get health care legislation passed.\u000a\u000aFlake, though, has been the most overt about his displeasure with the president -- making the TV rounds to discuss his book ahead of his re-election race next year.\u000a\u000a"If this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it," Flake writes in "Conscience of a Conservative." "If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?"\u000a\u000aThe White House has not shied from hitting back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Senator Flake would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the president than passing legislation,\u201d Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said last week when asked if the president would back a challenger.\u000a\u000aPolitico first reported, though, that Mercer plans to donate to the super PAC backing Flake challenger Kelli Ward, a former state senator who unsuccessfully ran against Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2016.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Fox News\u2019 Dana Perino on "The Story" last week, Flake denied being worried about a primary challenge.\u000a\u000a\u201cI'm going to run, run hard, have a good campaign, and I feel good about it,\u201d the senator said.\u000a\u000aLike Flake, Heller is facing a primary challenge in Nevada from the right: businessman Danny Tarkanian, the son of legendary Nevada basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian.\u000a\u000aHeller has long been considered vulnerable but his efforts to at least avoid a primary challenge grew more complicated when he declined to back the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s early ObamaCare overhaul plan.\u000a\u000aAt one point, a pro-Trump group called America First Policies briefly took out advertisements against Heller over his health care stance.\u000a\u000aGOP SEN. HELLER DRAWS 2018 PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM TRUMP SUPPORTER\u000a\u000aHeller ultimately backed a scaled-back measure. But the overall repeal effort failed, denying Trump, at least for now, his first major legislative victory.\u000a\u000aStill, some Republicans are skeptical about Tarkanian\u2019s chances. The candidate most recently lost a 2016 GOP primary bid for the seat of retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.\u000a\u000a"I think that Dean Heller has opened himself up to a challenge, but I don't think that Danny is the person to make that successful challenge," Republican strategist Rory McShane said Wednesday. "Beating Dean Heller would take the support of a lot of national groups like Club for Growth and the National Association of Gun Rights. It would be tough for Danny to win a primary without a lot of those national groups behind him."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, McConnell, who is not up for re-election this year, has been facing the wrath of Trump and his supporters after saying in a speech that Trump had \u201cexcessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process."\u000a\u000a\u201cHey Kentucky--time to tell @SenateMajLdr McConnell to stop rolling over for the Dems, advance the Trump agenda, or step aside,\u201d conservative radio host Laura Ingraham tweeted Thursday.\u000a\u000aTrump himself has been dinging McConnell on Twitter for not getting a health care bill through the Senate, despite Republicans pledging to repeal ObamaCare for years.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cMust Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!\u201d\u000a\u000aFox News' Joseph Weber contributed to this report.

Most of the weapons have landed in the Sea of Japan, which lies between Japan and the eastern coast of the massive Asian continent.\u000a\u000aGuam lies about 1,600 miles south of Japan.\u000a\u000aOnodera\u2019s comments reflected what observers have viewed as Japan\u2019s growing interest in reviving its military and taking a more aggressive stance in the affairs of the Asia-Pacific region than it has since the end of World War II.\u000a\u000aOnodera returned to the defense minister\u2019s position just last week following a Cabinet reshuffling by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzu Abe.

aVBy The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d Tuesday if it continues to menace the U.S. with nuclear weapons, he provoked almost as much backlash at home as in Pyongyang. The usual diplomatic suspects, including some American lawmakers, claimed his remarks hurt U.S. credibility and were irresponsible.\u000a\u000aThe President\u2019s point was that the North\u2019s escalating threats are intolerable; he didn\u2019t set any red lines. True to form, Pyongyang responded by putting the U.S. island of Guam in its cross hairs. Mr. Trump may be guilty of hyperbole (quelle surprise), but that is far less damaging to U.S. credibility than Barack Obama\u2019s failure to enforce his prohibition on the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons in Syria. The foreign-policy elite who claim to be shocked also don\u2019t have much credibility after their policy across three Administrations led to the current North Korean danger.\u000a\u000aWhile the President\u2019s words were unusually colorful, the Communist-style language may have been part of the message: Kim Jong Un isn\u2019t the only one who can raise the geopolitical temperature. The U.S. has military options to neutralize the regime\u2019s nuclear threat if it continues to develop long-range missiles, and the U.S. is considering those options.

aVBy Joby Warrick, Ellen Nakashima and Anna Fifield, The Washington Post\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles, crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, U.S. intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessment.\u000a\u000aThe new analysis completed last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency comes on the heels of another intelligence assessment that sharply raises the official estimate for the total number of bombs in the communist country\u2019s atomic arsenal. The U.S. calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Some independent experts believe the number of bombs is much smaller.\u000a\u000aThe findings are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving North Korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predicted. U.S. officials last month concluded that Pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking cities on the American mainland.\u000a\u000aCLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY AT THE WASHINGTON POST

Our nation\u2019s values are under assault. Religious liberty has been undermined. We live in a day when right is now wrong and wrong is now right. The vicious leftwing attack against the recent traditional marriage stance of Chick-fil-A should serve as a wakeup call to people of faith. It\u2019s not about a chicken sandwich. It\u2019s about religious liberty. It\u2019s about free speech. It\u2019s about the future of our nation.\u000a\u000aAs a reporter covering the culture war for FOX News, Todd Starnes is on the front lines of these attacks against traditional values. In God Less America, he uses both recent news stories and compelling interviews with today\u2019s top conservative leaders to bring to light what is happening across our country. In his award-winning, satire-meets-serious writing style, he strikes an important blow in today\u2019s culture wars.

aVBy Lukas Mikelionis, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Islamic State group is getting smarter about circumventing Western security, and events like last month\u2019s failed terror plot in Australia are likely to occur more frequently.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the assessment of a former counterterrorism expert for Turkey\u2019s national police following news reports last week that the Australian plot involved explosives and components that were shipped from Turkey.\u000a\u000aWriting in the Wall Street Journal, Ahmet S. Yayla, an adjunct professor at George Mason University in Virginia, says the bomb materials used in the aborted attack likely arrived in Australia via air cargo \u2013 probably aboard a passenger jet -- evading all security measures.\u000a\u000aAlthough the Australian operation ultimately failed, it was the type of plot that Western nations can expect to see more often, says Yayla, who from 2010 to 2013 led the counterterrorism and operations department of the Turkish National Police in Sanliurfa.

aVTaylor Swift testified Thursday former DJ David Mueller groped her during a meet-and-greet before a 2013 concert in Denver.\u000a\u000a"It was a definite grab, a very long grab," Swift said in federal court in Denver, where the civil trial is taking place. "I felt him grab onto my bare ass cheek."\u000a\u000aThe singer testified she attempted to move away from Mueller but "he would not let go."\u000a\u000a"He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek as I lurched away from him quite quickly," she told the courtroom.\u000a\u000aThe 27-year-old said the alleged incident was "a very shocking thing that never happened to me before."\u000a\u000aTAYLOR SWIFT'S TRIAL IN DJ ALLEGED GROPING INCIDENT EXPLAINED\u000a\u000aShe said, "After this happened, it was like a light switched off in my personality...[when it was over] I said 'Thank you for coming.'"\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aSwift said she didn't stop the meet-and-greets after Mueller left because she didn't want to disappoint a few dozen people who'd been waiting in line.\u000a\u000a"This was something I did not want known," Swift explained adding she first mentioned the incident about 15 minutes later to her photographer Stephanie Simbeck.\u000a\u000aIn her testimony, the pop star was cordial, but direct and sometimes testy while being questioned by a lawyer representing Mueller.\u000a\u000aWhen questioned about her reaction when she learned that Mueller had been fired over the allegations, Swift replied that she was not going to allow the lawyer or Mueller make her feel like it was her fault.\u000a\u000aThe "Bad Blood" singer also said security guard Greg Dent saw Mueller "lift my skirt" and grab her but that it was impossible for anyone to see Mueller's hand beneath her skirt and on her buttock because they were posing for the photo with their backs to a wall. She said that someone would have had to have been underneath her to see the actual groping "and we didn't have anyone positioned there."\u000a\u000aSwift was more serious when asked her reaction to Mueller being fired.\u000a\u000a"I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions, not mine," she told jurors.\u000a\u000a"Do you think Mr. Mueller got what he deserved?" his attorney Gabriel McFarland asked.\u000a\u000a"I don't feel anything about Mr. Mueller. I don't know him. ... I think what he did was despicable and horrifying and shocking."\u000a\u000aMueller, his hair white compared to his image from the photo op, stared at a table while the singer-songwriter testified.\u000a\u000aMueller testified Wednesday that the photo taken before the concert was "weird and awkward," but he insisted that he touched Swift in the ribs, not in the rear. Mueller testified his hand was touching Swift's skirt after he put his arm around her and their arms got crossed: "My hand was at rib-cage level and apparently it went down."\u000a\u000aSwift's mother Andrea Swift testified through tears on Wednesday that she didn't advise her daughter to contact police. She said she didn't want the incident to "define [Taylor's] life."\u000a\u000aMueller sued Swift and others on her team, claiming they cost him his job and is seeking up to $3 million in damages. Swift countersued, alleging sexual assault, and is asking for a symbolic $1 judgment.\u000a\u000aMORE: Taylor Swift's alleged groping photo\u000a\u000aSwift's lawyers have said she does not know Mueller and has no incentive to target him or to fabricate a story.\u000a\u000aThe case is being tried in federal court under a law allowing the proceeding when the parties live in separate states and the dispute involves a damages claim higher than $75,000.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aYou can find Sasha Savitsky on Twitter @SashaFB.

aVBuried deep in a Freedom of Information Act document release last week to a conservative group were a series of emails that pertained to how the Justice Department handled questions from reporters about a 2016 airport tarmac meeting between former President Bill Clinton and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch - the emails included a recipient named, "Elizabeth Carlisle," which reports now indicate was the email alias for President Obama's Attorney General.\u000a\u000a"The ACLJ has unmasked former Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch's alias email account," the American Center for Law and Justice announced on its website, showing off details of how the Justice Department crafted a "Talking points/statement" - though those internal deliberations were redacted (blacked out).\u000a\u000aTodd spoke to Judge Ken Starr, a former U.S. solicitor general and federal judge who served as independent counsel in the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations.\u000a\u000aTodd Starnes: I'm anxious to hear your opinion about about these, emails many of which were redacted regarding the meeting between Loretta Lynch and former President Clinton. What does that tell you?\u000a\u000aKen Starr: It tells us that there is a lot to be explored. I was very distressed, loving the Justice Department as I do, I served two tours of duty there and we want the Justice Department to do the right thing and to do it in the right way. We do not want in this country a politicized Justice Department. This is not Venezuela; this is the United States of America. We've got to keep the Justice Department as pure as humanly possible. This was a colossally bad judgment blunder on the part of the Attorney General of the United States. She never should have agreed to, I mean he is the former president but let's face it, there was a very important investigation underway and for that meeting, and to know that it was forty five minutes long on the tarmac at a minimum creates a huge issue of the independence and the integrity of the Justice Department. We need to know everything.\u000a\u000aTS: Do you think that they were talking about more than just grandchildren and golf scores?\u000a\u000aKS: It doesn't take forty five minutes to tell someone, especially the Attorney General of the United States, who's busy and who's on a tarmac. She's either ready to go to a meeting or she's ready to go in to resume her official duties. I just think forty five minutes suggests that, just the suggestion, we don't know, we need to know, that it was much more than a courtesy call and totally and just social. The appearance is horrible.\u000a\u000aTS: Why is it that the FBI is so interested in Paul Manafort that they actually just showed up unannounced at his doorstep? What do you think is going on there?\u000a\u000aKS: Well we don't know, we can only speculate. But I will tell you this. When the decision is made to go to a judge, a magistrate judge, supported by an affidavit saying this is why we need to go into Mr. Manafort's residence and we need to do it quickly, efficiently and when he's not expecting it, that tells me that there is information. We don't know the the full extent of it, but there is information that is obviously very worrisome to justify going into a home.\u000a\u000aTS: Is it possible that what happened on that tarmac could in fact be the bigger story?\u000a\u000aKS: It could very well be. We need to get to the bottom of that because if there was, if, it's a big if, but if there was an effort by the former President of the United States to impede an investigation or to narrow the investigation, then that is extremely serious indeed.\u000a\u000aListen to the full interview below:

aVBy Newt Gingrich | Fox News\u000a\u000aChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s decision to sue the Department of Justice because it\u2019s asking the Chicago Police Department to obey the law perfectly illustrates the dangerous disdain the modern Left has for normal Americans.\u000a\u000aOn July 25, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked all cities, states, and territories applying for a very specific federal law enforcement grant to adhere to three new, very reasonable measures: To openly communicate with the Department of Homeland Security; to allow DHS officers to meet with locally-held prisoners who live in the country illegally and have been arrested for non-immigration related crimes; and to give the Department 48 hours\u2019 notice before releasing such prisoners.\u000a\u000aThese are fairly simple, practical, common sense requirements \u2013 which the vast majority of cities and states gladly meet. Of course, federal, state, and local agencies should talk to and work with one another to enforce our laws. Federal agents shouldn\u2019t be expected to consult a crystal ball to track down and deport people here illegally who are committing crimes \u2013 especially since local police know better than anyone about criminal aliens operating in their communities.\u000a\u000aYet, Mayor Emanuel is defending Chicago\u2019s so-called sanctuary status, claiming that these requirements, \u201csow fear in local immigrant communities and ultimately make the people of Chicago less safe.\u201d

aVFew people have had as much success in Hollywood as daytime talk show host and comedian Ellen DeGeneres. However, the star is now opening up about the incredibly difficult road she was forced to take to make it as an out celebrity in show business.\u000a\u000aWith an incredibly vast social media following, 59 Daytime Emmy Awards, a loving relationship with wife Portia de Rossi and a Presidential Medal of Freedom, DeGeneres\u2019 star seems like it can\u2019t get any bigger. However, for the 59-year-old comic, it doesn\u2019t feel like that long ago that she was having her name and reputation dragged through the mud for coming out as a lesbian on the cover of TIME in 1997. Things would get so bad that she\u2019d lose her sitcom and be forced to move out of L.A., which she recently chronicled in an interview with Good Housekeeping.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe bullying I endured [in Hollywood] after I came out made up for the lack of it during my childhood," she said of losing the status she worked hard for. "I moved out of L.A., went into a severe depression, started seeing a therapist and had to go on antidepressants for the first time in my life," she says. "It was scary and lonely. All I'd known for 30 years was work, and all of a sudden I had nothing. Plus, I was mad. It didn't feel fair \u2014 I was the same person everyone had always known."\u000a\u000aFortunately, with so much time having passed, the star went on to explain that she\u2019s learned to understand the point of view of those that wronged her in the past, and has found a way to forgive them.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnger and aggression weaken you, because they take so much energy to hold in place,\u201d she said. \u201cBut kindness is a strength [that] makes you more serene.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeGeneres built her career from the ground up twice. The first saw her struggle in the comedy world to develop her voice and then find an audience. Soon after, she had to do it again after she made the decision to not only publicly come out, but to allow her character, Ellen Morgan, to do the same. As Vanity Fair previously noted, Morgan became the first gay lead character on TV in a time when LGBTQ characters were mostly ignored or treated as tragic figures.

But his treatment involved a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a natural resistance to HIV, which is risky and impractical due to the large number of patients already infected.\u000a\u000aWhat's hopeful about the girl's case, is that she is the third child to enter long remission after beginning aggressive treatment soon after infection. She started when she was two and stopped 40 weeks later. Tests found the virus was not capable of reproducing in her immune system cells.\u000a\u000aFor more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.\u000a\u000aHousecall for Health, I'm Alex Hein, FOX News.

For some, that includes gender reassignment.\u000a\u000aThen imagine, you go through all that and you wake up in a new \u201ccommunity,\u201d which encouraged you to change yourself, while promising love, support and a way to finally belong, without judgment and with complete understanding.\u000a\u000aOr so you think.\u000a\u000aSuddenly, the crowd which encouraged you to color outside the lines now presents you with new rules about how to correctly be your own person.\u000a\u000aNo, this isn\u2019t a pitch for yet another incarnation of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d or a long-lost manuscript from the great Ray Bradbury.

aVBy Fred Fleitz, Fox News\u000a\u000aTuesday's bombshell Washington Post story that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has determined North Korea is capable of constructing miniaturized nuclear weapons that could be used as warheads for missiles \u2013 possibly ICBMs \u2013 left out a crucial fact: DIA actually concluded this in 2013. The Post also failed to mention that the Obama administration tried to downplay and discredit this report at the time.\u000a\u000aDuring an April 11, 2013, House Armed Services Committee hearing, Congressman Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., inadvertently revealed several unclassified sentences from a DIA report that said DIA had determined with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that North Korea has the capability to make a nuclear weapon small enough to be launched with a ballistic missile.\u000a\u000aThe Director of National Intelligence and Obama officials subsequently tried to dismiss Lamborn\u2019s disclosure by claiming the DIA assessment was an outlier that did not reflect the views of the rest of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\u000a\u000aIt was clear what Obama officials were doing in 2013. The DIA report represented inconvenient facts that threatened President Obama\u2019s North Korea \u201cstrategic patience\u201d policy -- a policy to do nothing about North Korea and kick this problem down the road to the next president. Obama officials tried to downplay the DIA assessment to prevent it from being used to force the president to employ a more assertive North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worth noting that the Trump White House has not condemned the Washington Post story as a leak. That\u2019s probably because it was an authorized disclosure of classified information to advance President Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy. That is, instead of concealing intelligence to avoid taking action against the tough North Korea problem like the Obama administration did, the Trump administration publicized this same intelligence to demonstrate the seriousness of this threat and why decisive action by the United States is required.

"It is the job of [Defense] Secretary [Jim] Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally ... That is his mandate."\u000a\u000aGorka sought to clarify his remarks Thursday afternoon in an interview on Fox News' "Your World with Neil Cavuto."\u000a\u000a"I was admonishing the journalists of the fake news industrial complex who are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they are demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state," Gorka told host Liz Claman. "That\u2019s why we have a department of defense. If a journalist doesn\u2019t know the difference between the secretary of state and the department of defense, they should hand in their credentials. It\u2019s just absurd lack of understanding."\u000a\u000aGorka said that Tillerson had "done an amazing job" to help guide new sanctions against North Korea through the United Nations Security Council, but "when reporters try to force him to make statements regarding military options, they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about, and if they think that\u2019s a story, they\u2019re not journalists."

aVBy Dr. Keith Ablow | Fox News\u000a\u000aNew Planned Parenthood guidelines for parents now advise that children as young as four years old be informed that having a penis or a vagina doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are male or female. Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches. Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.

aVAmerican citizens have always been the backbone of ambitious solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems. The twenty-first century has seen an unprecedented rise in generosity and a steep decline in global poverty. In The Quiet Revolution, readers are invited inside the White House to see how presidents have aided in this success by rallying Americans to serve their nation by volunteering in their local communities and around the world.\u000a\u000aPresident George W. Bush\u2019s Faith-Based and Community Initiative was a catalyst for many of these dramatic social improvements. Yet, the big story is not what happened in Washington, D.C., but rather what takes place in countless communities across the nation. There is not a social problem in America that is not being addressed by a faith-based or community group every day.\u000a\u000aThe Quiet Revolution is about championing the unsung work of ordinary volunteers spurred by faith and simple goodwill to roll up their sleeves in order to care for their neighbors in need.

Then, two birds from a tree ahead darted out, between me and the houses on my left.\u000a\u000a"We all looked, but the Syrian turned toward us and began shooting over our heads at the birds. The rest of us hit the ground. Even though our host took his gun away, I gave them mine and went back because, if there is a way to overreact, the Syrian would think it is natural and can't even consider the consequences.\u000a\u000a"You cannot place these people in a position of authority (for example with a gun in their hands).

Even if our worst fears are realized, and Kim Jong Un decided to lash out with nuclear weapons, Washington would ensure Pyongyang was turned into atomic ash\u2014what would clearly be the end of the so-called \u201chermit kingdom\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut what is lost in our recent conversations of war and peace in Asia today are two key questions: Just how bad would such a conflict be and what happens when the war is over?\u000a\u000aStop and think about it for a second. If we accept the fact that a war fought on the Korean peninsula -- if waged with no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, which is by no means a certainty\u2014it stands to reason that the number of conventional weapons used by North and South Korea, America and likely Japan or others would flatten large sections of the Korea peninsula. To make matters worse, such carnage would likely spread to the Japanese home islands, U.S. military bases around the region or even Guam, Hawaii or Alaska.\u000a\u000aTo focus our minds around this terrifying problem, let us consider for a moment just one of the many very real scenarios that could occur in what would be a Second Korean War. If, for example, North Korea were to launch a salvo of artillery shells into Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital\u2014just a mere 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates north and south\u2014the devastation could be catastrophic. Imagine countless skyscrapers and tall buildings collapsing to the earth, millions of people fleeing to mass transit and clogging all exits out of one of the world\u2019s largest cities. It would be, in many respects, 9/11\u2014but times a hundred. The rebuilding of downtown Seoul would be in the billions of dollars, not to mention the rebuilding of countless people\u2019s lives. Just that one act alone, in what could be the opening chapter of a war the brutality of which we have not seen in generations\u2014not to mention would be magnified on social media many times over\u2014would horrify us all for generations to come.

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

aVIn a story Aug. 8, The Associated Press reported on flight restrictions near President Donald Trump's properties during visits to Florida and New Jersey. The story should have noted that similar flight restrictions for presidential visits have been in place for decades, and were expanded after the 9/11 attacks, affecting local airports during visits from Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aA clarified version of the story is below:\u000a\u000aThor Solberg's business is down \u2014 try practically nonexistent \u2014 at a time when it's usually way up, and he has President Donald Trump to thank for it.\u000a\u000aSolberg's is one of two small airports in western New Jersey that are essentially closed down because of federal aviation regulations because they are within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of where Trump is spending 17 days this month at his Bedminster country club. More than a dozen other airports also face restrictions.\u000a\u000aThis is high season for small airports that cater to amateur fliers and business clients. But at Solberg-Hunterdon Airport, which averages about 100 combined takeoffs and landings per day, a handful of planes sat idle Monday. Normally 70 to 80 planes would be paying to be housed there and paying for fuel and flight training time, Solberg said.\u000a\u000a"Twenty percent of our annual business is affected by the president's visits in the summertime because that's how much of our business takes place on the weekends in the summertime," Solberg said.\u000a\u000aSmall airports and aviation-related businesses near Trump's properties in Florida and New Jersey have lost out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in business already this year. And they have no recourse other than to appeal to the Secret Service, which oversees presidential security.\u000a\u000aThe temporary closure rules are not unique to Trump's vacations. Similar flight restrictions for presidential visits have been in place for decades, and were expanded after the 9/11 attacks, affecting local airports during visits from Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aSeveral members of New Jersey's congressional delegation sent a letter to the Secret Service in June urging it to consider allowing the airports near Trump's residence to use a system similar to one in place near Washington, D.C., that allows properly screened pilots to fly to and from airports in a security-sensitive area.\u000a\u000aSo far, there has been no response, Republican Rep. Leonard Lance said Monday. A Secret Service spokeswoman didn't return an email seeking comment.\u000a\u000a"We want New Jersey to be treated as, apparently, Maryland is treated," Lance said. "I'm hopeful the Secret Service will examine the situation based on past precedents."\u000a\u000aAn appeal to the Secret Service also proved unsuccessful for the owners of a small Florida airport that lies within the no-fly zone near Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. In March, the Secret Service told the tenants of Lantana Airport that aircraft couldn't take off from the facility, which is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southwest of Mar-a-Lago. The 28 businesses at the airport include a flight school and banner operation. They said they were losing thousands of dollars each time Trump visited.\u000a\u000aJonathan Miller, the contractor who operates the airport, told The Associated Press earlier this year that a helicopter company opted to move elsewhere rather than deal with the airport closures, taking an estimated $440,000 in annual rent and fuel payments with it.\u000a\u000aMichelle Edwards, office manager at Palm Beach Flight Training at Lantana, said it was especially stressful in the spring when Trump's visits closed the airport for three straight weekends, usually with about two days' notice.\u000a\u000a"We have customers, their first question when they call is, 'Am I even going to be able to train there because of President Trump coming down so much?'" Edwards said. "So, we have customers leaving, going elsewhere and not even starting with us because they're nervous about President Trump coming in."\u000a\u000aSolberg echoed Edwards' concerns about the potentially long-lasting effects of the disruption.\u000a\u000a"It's not just the current revenue that's a problem," he said, noting the airport is losing "tens of thousands of dollars" this month. "It's the fact that we're unable to get continuous new business because we're unable to provide potential customers with a service that they can rely on."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aAssociated Press video journalist Joshua Replogle in Palm Beach County, Florida, contributed to this story.

aVA federal judge has ordered the State Department to search the \u201cstate.gov\u201d email accounts of Hillary Clinton aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills and Jacob Sullivan for records related to Benghazi, as part of a watchdog\u2019s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\u000a\u000aU.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Amit Mehta made the call Tuesday, describing the FOIA lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch in March 2015 as \u201ca far cry from a typical FOIA case.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe noted that \u201cSecretary Clinton used a private e-mail server located in her home, to transmit and receive work-related communications during her tenure as Secretary of State.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sole remaining dispute in this case is the adequacy of State\u2019s search for responsive records,\u201d Mehta wrote in his opinion and order, noting the State Department has argued the search through Clinton aides\u2019 emails \u201cis likely to be unfruitful.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Mehta wrote that the State Department \u201chas not, however, searched the one records system over which it has always had control and that is almost certain to contain some responsive records: the state.gov email server.\u201d\u000a\u000aFAVOR FACTORY? HUMA EMAILS REVEAL CLINTON ALLIES SEEKING JOBS, MEETINGS\u000a\u000a\u201cIf Secretary Clinton sent an email about Benghazi to Abedin, Mills, or Sullivan at his or her state.gov email address, or if one of them sent an e-mail to Secretary Clinton using his or her state.gov account, then State\u2019s server presumably would have captured and stored such an email,\u201d Mehta wrote. \u201cState has an obligation to search its own server for responsive records.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe conservative watchdog group is engaged in numerous FOIA lawsuits seeking records pertaining to the actions of the last administration -- including, in this case, records regarding the response to the 2012 terror attack in Libya.\u000a\u000aThe court ordered that the State Department conduct a \u201csupplemental search\u201d of Abedin, Mills and Sullivan state.gov email accounts, and set a deadline of Sept. 22 for the department to update the court on the status.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis major court ruling may finally result in more answers about the Benghazi scandal\u2014and Hillary Clinton\u2019s involvement in it \u2013as we approach the attack\u2019s fifth anniversary,\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said. \u201cIt is remarkable that we had to battle both Obama and Trump administrations to break through the State Department\u2019s Benghazi stonewall.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

aVHeartbroken relatives of a 3-year-old boy who died after being left in a hot van outside a day care facility in Florida say his death is simply \u201cnot right\u201d \u2014 and was the result of gross negligence.\u000a\u000aBarbara Livingston, the boy\u2019s great-aunt, told the Orlando Sentinel that relatives of 3-year-old Myles Hill started getting worried at about 8 p.m. Monday, about 90 minutes after the bus typically arrived at the family\u2019s home. The boy\u2019s grandmother, who has custody, tried calling workers at the Little Miracles Academy in Orlando, but couldn\u2019t reach its owners, so she called police and visited the day care herself, Livingston said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was on the phone with her and she started to scream, \u2018He\u2019s in the van, dead!\u2019\u201d Livingston recalled, saying the \u201cvery happy little boy\u201d who would\u2019ve turned 4 later this month died simply due to being abandoned.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you leave your child with someone, that person has the responsibility of taking care of them,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cHe had to lose his life because of someone\u2019s neglect. It\u2019s not right at all. If you have six kids get in the van, you make sure six kids get out of the van.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharges are pending against the driver of the van, who has been cooperative with authorities, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters during a news conference Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is your worst nightmare come true,\u201d Mina told reporters, adding that the \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d could\u2019ve been prevented.\u000a\u000aAn autopsy still hadn\u2019t been performed, but detectives believe it will show that Myles died of heat-related causes, the fifth child to die in a hot car in Florida this year and the 32nd nationwide, according to NoHeatStroke.org, a website that tracks heatstroke-related deaths of children in vehicles.\u000a\u000aRead more from The New York Post

aVBy Walt Heyer, The Daily Mail\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he wouldn\u2019t allow transgender individuals to serve in the military:\u000a\u000aAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... \u2014 Donald J.

Vicky Hartzler\u2019s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which would have banned the military from funding such treatments.\u000a\u000aPaying for transition-related surgeries for military service members and their families is beyond comprehensible.\u000a\u000aPerhaps they have forgotten that our military was forged to be the world\u2019s strongest fighting force, not a government-funded, politically correct, medical sex change clinic for people with gender dysphoria.\u000a\u000aGender dysphoria, the common diagnosis for one who feels at odds with his or her birth gender, develops from prolonged anxiety and depression. People are not born that way.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1942, in the dead of night, eight Nazi saboteurs landed by submarine on the eastern shores of the United States.\u000a\u000aSent by Hitler himself, the invaders planned to blow up industrial targets and spread fear and panic throughout the country. The Nazi dictator intended to strike a second blow to an America still reeling from the attacks at Pearl Harbor just six months earlier. But the U.S. Coast Guard and the FBI uncovered the plot and tracked down the enemy agents. These saboteurs met their fate in a secret military trial that is still controversial to this day.\u000a\u000aThis group of saboteurs was not the first Nazi agents discovered on American soil. In New York in 1941, 44 men and women were arrested as part of a spy ring that sent American military secrets back to Germany. What is shocking about these two episodes of sabotage is that all the men and women working for Hitler lived here in America. They spoke English, worked in American factories and businesses, many were American citizens. Yet they believed in Nazi Germany and many were involved in a sinister pro-Hitler organization based right here in America called the German American Bund. They seemed like Americans, but they came to kill.\u000a\u000aIn this episode of "War Stories With Oliver North," you'll hear the fascinating tales of enemy agents infiltrating the United States. You'll meet the U.S. Coast Guardsman and FBI agents who worked together to stop these acts of sabotage.\u000a\u000aThis is the story of the men who invaded our country and those who stopped them.

It is the closest the world has come to a possible nuclear exchange since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. That crisis, you will remember, ended only after President Kennedy imposed a naval blockade (an act of war in international law) and threatened further escalation. That threat, credible as it was, led to a diplomatic solution.

He shouldn\u2019t be negotiating Middle East peace.\u201d All three podcasters enjoyed referring to anyone near Trump as incompetent and liars. They agreed that healthcare reform is not dead in Congress, though. Their counter to the hopelessness felt by so many loser Democrats is to keep protesting and reaching out to members of Congress.\u000a\u000aThe three talked about parties at the White House and the White House Correspondents Dinner where they drank too much and showed up at the White House the next day to be sobered up by the photos of a dead Bin Laden. Gosh. Sorry that America\u2019s most wanted dead terrorist had to ruin your buzz, guys.\u000a\u000aChelsea asked if it was legal to stop White House briefings and they all said yes.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis | Fox News\u000a\u000aFact: The United States and its allies in the Asia-Pacific would demolish North Korea in any conceivable military scenario. Even if our worst fears are realized, and Kim Jong Un decided to lash out with nuclear weapons, Washington would ensure Pyongyang was turned into atomic ash\u2014what would clearly be the end of the so-called \u201chermit kingdom\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut what is lost in our recent conversations of war and peace in Asia today are two key questions: Just how bad would such a conflict be and what happens when the war is over?\u000a\u000aStop and think about it for a second. If we accept the fact that a war fought on the Korean peninsula -- if waged with no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, which is by no means a certainty\u2014it stands to reason that the number of conventional weapons used by North and South Korea, America and likely Japan or others would flatten large sections of the Korea peninsula. To make matters worse, such carnage would likely spread to the Japanese home islands, U.S. military bases around the region or even Guam, Hawaii or Alaska.\u000a\u000aTo focus our minds around this terrifying problem, let us consider for a moment just one of the many very real scenarios that could occur in what would be a Second Korean War. If, for example, North Korea were to launch a salvo of artillery shells into Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital\u2014just a mere 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates north and south\u2014the devastation could be catastrophic. Imagine countless skyscrapers and tall buildings collapsing to the earth, millions of people fleeing to mass transit and clogging all exits out of one of the world\u2019s largest cities. It would be, in many respects, 9/11\u2014but times a hundred. The rebuilding of downtown Seoul would be in the billions of dollars, not to mention the rebuilding of countless people\u2019s lives. Just that one act alone, in what could be the opening chapter of a war the brutality of which we have not seen in generations\u2014not to mention would be magnified on social media many times over\u2014would horrify us all for generations to come.

aVWhen Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, America was deeply in debt, with its economy and dignity under attack. Pirates from North Africa\u2019s Barbary Coast routinely captured American merchant ships and held the sailors as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute payments far beyond what the new country could afford.\u000a\u000aFor fifteen years, America had tried to work with the four Muslim powers (Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco) driving the piracy, but negotiation proved impossible. Realizing it was time to stand up to the intimidation, Jefferson decided to move beyond diplomacy. He sent the U.S. Navy and Marines to blockade Tripoli\u2014launching the Barbary Wars and beginning America\u2019s journey toward future superpower status.\u000a\u000aFew today remember these men and other heroes who inspired the Marine Corps hymn: \u201cFrom the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli, we fight our country\u2019s battles in the air, on land and sea.\u201d Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates recaptures this forgotten war that changed American history with a real-life drama of intrigue, bravery, and battle on the high seas.

aVA new study commissioned by a Washington, D.C., suburb could send a warning shot to local governments taking up the \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 \u2013 predicting a proposed minimum wage hike would cost thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in lost income.\u000a\u000aThe study was conducted to assess the impact of a proposal in Montgomery County, Md., to raise the minimum wage to $15, up from $11.50. Such a proposal cleared the county council in January but was vetoed by County Executive Isiah Leggett, who commissioned the study.\u000a\u000aThe results could strike a blow to ongoing efforts in the liberal-leaning county to hike the wage, finding:\u000a\u000a47,000 jobs would be lost by 2022, most of them \u201clow-wage positions\u201d\u000a\u000aLost income would total about $396.5 million by 2022\u000a\u000aLost county income tax revenue would total over $40 million in that time period\u000a\u000a\u201cThe proposed increase in the County minimum wage has the potential to provide some important benefits,\u201d the study noted. \u201cAn increase in earnings for low-wage County workers will have tangible positive impacts for low-income workers and their families. This should also lead to reductions in poverty, improvement in mental health and a reduction in hunger and stress among minimum wage workers.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it continued, \u201c\u2026 At the same time, it is also projected that the wage increase will lead to a significant loss of low-wage jobs. This loss of jobs would lead to a loss of income among County residents. This also has the spillover effect of reduced income tax revenue for the County.\u201d\u000a\u000aBUSINESSES WARN OF PRICE HIKES AS WAGE INCREASES KICK IN\u000a\u000aThe study was released at the end of July, the same month more than a dozen other cities and counties started their fiscal year with a minimum wage increase.\u000a\u000aSome of those increases are modest, while others are aiming for the $15-an-hour benchmark that has become a rallying cry of the left. This debate has been particularly heated in Seattle, where the $15-an-hour wage has divided employers and scholars \u2013 dueling studies were released earlier this year, with one showing the wage hike cost jobs and another showing the opposite.\u000a\u000aIn the Maryland study, supporters of a wage increase reportedly took issue with the fact that consultant PFM based the study on the predictions of employers, with one calling it \u201cnonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut according to The Washington Post, Leggett said even if employers cut half the jobs predicted in the study, \u201cthose are some startling numbers.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVThe most sophisticated terror plot ever attempted on Australian soil \u2013 to bring down an Etihad airline leaving Sydney airport \u2013 is now known to have been planned, directed and even supplied directly by ISIS.\u000a\u000aNot only did the instructions for the attack come directly from commanders in the terror group \u2013 but the military-grade plastic explosives used to build the bomb were sent via airmail. They were shipped from Turkey to Australia by commercial air cargo, most probably in a passenger jet.\u000a\u000aThat high-grade explosives were so easily sent via airmail, halfway across the world will have alarm bells ringing in Western security agencies. Plastic explosives are hard to detect, but newer x-ray machines usually have the capacity to find them, raising questions about how were they disguised.\u000a\u000aISIS DIRECTED, SENT EXPLOSIVES FOR FOILED AUSTRALIA PLOT\u000a\u000aThe original plot was disrupted by Australian security services on July 29, following a tip from a foreign intelligence service. The plotters, who have now been arrested and charged, were brothers Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat. It\u2019s believed they were recruited by another brother, Tarek Khayat, who is an ISIS commander in Syria.\u000a\u000aThey received the explosives in Sydney along with other components needed to build the bomb, including detonators. Then, with instructions from an ISIS commander, put the device together.\u000a\u000aISIS GETTING SMARTER ABOUT PENETRATING WESTERN SECURITY, ANTI-TERROR EXPERT WARNS\u000a\u000aThe brothers put it in luggage and went to the airport, but for reasons that are unknown abandoned the plan before passing through security. It\u2019s alleged they had placed the bomb in a third brother\u2019s bag without his knowledge. Australian police claim the bomb would never have passed through airport security.\u000a\u000aInstead, the brothers began working on a chemical-dispersion device to release hydrogen sulfide, a highly toxic gas.\u000a\u000aThe plot is clear evidence that ISIS is getting smarter about circumventing Western security \u2013 and, as they lose territory in Iraq and Syria, are looking at increasingly varied ways to attack Western targets \u2013 and recruit fighters.\u000a\u000a

Trump does deserve some credit for the soaring stock market.\u000a\u000aAs of Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had scored record highs for nine days in a row; the gains are driving anti-Trumpers crazy. Though the president\u2019s boasts are not always accurate, lapses the New York Times eagerly documents, his recent tweet celebrating the Dow passing 22,000 for the first time is on the mark.\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is correct: it doesn\u2019t just happen. That doesn\u2019t mean the liberal media will stand down from their incessant anti-Trump alarmism and admit that his pro-business policies might be boosting economic growth or doing the country some good.\u000a\u000aHence, recent pieces have dredged up other reasons for the gains in stocks, many of which are valid. Earnings gains have indeed been above expectations; there is vast monetary stimulus around the world, we see renewed growth in China and Europe and a weakening dollar; all those elements and more have played a role.\u000a\u000aBut, they are not the entire story.

aVCritics of the sanctuary city crackdown say it will chill immigrants from helping ICE go after MS-13 gang members, but the feds say they have plenty of tools \u2013 including a change in visa status - to win cooperation from the immigrant community.\u000a\u000aThe options seem to be paying off, with investigators from ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations saying immigrant cooperation is making a big difference in the fight against the lethal and ruthless MS-13 gang.\u000a\u000aIn an atmosphere where cooperating with law enforcement is a death sentence imposed by the gang, most illegal immigrants appear to be more concerned about how to obtain legal resident status than financial reward, said one investigator who declined to be identified.\u000a\u000aBut at the same time, critics warn that the visa tool should be used only sparingly, since it could lead to fraudulent claims.\u000a\u000aOne of the fierce defenders is Eddy Wang, Section Chief, HSI Contraband Smuggling and Gang Unit, who said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to close a good number of our cases without the cooperation of the immigrant community.\u000a\u000a\u201cGang members prey on the immigrant community by co-opting their children, exploiting the vulnerable with drugs, and violence. They don\u2019t want to be victims so they work with us.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Wang said, contrary to the public perception that ICE/HSI agents conduct massive sweeps through illegal immigrant communities, they actually reach out to them and explain the options available to let them live without the specter of gang violence.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a very robust victim assistance and community outreach program that informs the illegal immigrant community what their options are for legal resident status if they cooperate with law enforcement,\u201d Wang said.\u000a\u000aAmong these are asylum, the S visa for witnesses and informants; T visa, which applies to victims of human trafficking; and the U visa, for victims of violence.\u000a\u000aAccording to spokeswoman Rita Moore, the agency holds webinars for law enforcement and stakeholder groups about the U-Visa and other immigration relief programs.\u201cIn the last two years, USCIS has held 21 national webinars for more than 4,000 law enforcement officers, community groups, and practitioners,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aBut Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies, Center for Immigration Studies, cautions against overly promoting the program due to the high risk of fraud and says law enforcement has other options.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it is a good tool if used sparingly to reward people who are critical in especially significant prosecutions, not just as a back-door green card for anyone who has been the victim of a crime,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cExperience shows when it is promoted, large numbers of people try to use it as a way to stay here, even if they have nothing significant of value to offer in any case.\u201d\u000a\u000aVaughn said people will go so far as to make up stories of being victimized and shop around for a police department that will sign off on the U visa application.\u000a\u000aAccording to Vaughn, ICE often prefers Significant Public Benefit Parole because they have more control over the witness and they can withhold or terminate the benefit if the witness becomes uncooperative or turns out to have nothing worthwhile to help the case. If the U visa were offered instead, they can\u2019t take it back easily and the victim could clam up, leaving them with nothing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny police department can tell you stories of fraudulent victimization claims to try to get the visa,\u201d she said. \u201cI assure you, if there is an appropriate possibility to use it in a gang case, ICE is already on top of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aWang countered by saying fraud is difficult because ultimately law enforcement has to verify and sign off on the victim\u2019s application.\u000a\u000aWang said he was frustrated by what he thought was the distortion of the program by special interest groups, adding the primary role of HSI in fighting crime was to work with victims, regardless of their immigration status, and arrest criminals.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t check the immigration status of victims or witnesses,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhen you politicize public safety there\u2019s no winners, just losers.\u201d\u000a\u000aEffective suppression of MS-13 relies heavily on the cooperation of residents in the Central American community and even gang members themselves looking to save their own skin or escape the clutches of a violent culture. But in order to achieve this bond of trust, a viable carrot must be offered.\u000a\u000aWang said HSI is now seeing the fruit of these labors.\u000a\u000aJoseph J.

aVFor more than half a century, football helmets have done a great job of preventing skull fractures, but they\u2019ve been ineffective when it came to preventing concussions and protecting the brain. They just weren\u2019t meant to do that.\u000a\u000aBut now there\u2019s a new helmet that\u2019s been designed to protect not only the skull, but what\u2019s inside it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Zero1 and it\u2019s ranked No. 1 on the NFL/NFLPA 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results. VICIS, the Seattle-based sports equipment company that makes the Zero1, says 25 of the NFL's 32 teams bought the helmets before spring practice, and the company hopes many NFL players \u2014 and players on at least 20 NCAA teams \u2014 will be wearing them during the upcoming season.\u000a\u000aDoug Baldwin, a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who is working with VICIS, said participation in football nationwide has diminished because of fear of concussions and their link to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) \u2014 but the Zero1 helmet should change all that.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a"We take significant hits on the football field. Football is a violent collision sport," Baldwin said. "A product like this can give you that confidence of safety. It can boost your performance. I think it's going to save the game."\u000a\u000aDave Marver, VICIS\u2019 co-founder and CEO, said the Zero1 has four protective layers that "are designed to work together to provide outstanding fit and mitigate impact forces or slow them before they can reach the head and brain \u2026 better than any helmet ever made":\u000a\u000aThe outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, yielding when it's hit and slowing impact forces.\u000a\u000aRight below that is a second, reflex layer of columns that "bend and eventually buckle upon impact."\u000a\u000aThe third layer is a very thin hard shell that protects against skull fractures.\u000a\u000aThe fourth, innermost layer is the form liner, which conforms to the player's head.\u000a\u000aMarver said traditional helmets have a hard outer shell that makes a \u201ccrack\u201d sound on impact. The Zero1, on the other hand, goes \u201cthump.\u201d\u000a\u000a"The sound of the game is going to change,\u201d Marver said. \u201cIt means that players are going to be better protected."\u000a\u000aDr. Sam Browd, a pediatric neurosurgeon and co-founder of VICIS, said no helmet will fully eliminate concussions from football. But he said the Zero1 should prove very effective in reducing them.\u000a\u000aBrowd teamed up with Marver and VICIS\u2019 chief technology officer, Per Reinhall, to create the Zero1 because he had treated many teenagers who had to quit football because of repetitive head injuries.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000a"This was sad,\u201d Marver said. \u201cSo Sam wanted to do something about that, and he brought Per and me together and we started the company."\u000a\u000aA Zero1 helmet costs $1,500, much more than others, "because it's a more sophisticated design," Marver said. Besides the potential to reduce concussions, the helmet provides better peripheral vision, so players can see more of the field and opponents coming at them.\u000a\u000aReinhall said VICIS\u2019 technicians "torture the helmet" extensively, using a linear ram machine and a pendulum that hits the helmet at different speeds to judge its performance in the company's "smash lab."\u000a\u000aBrowd said a lot of players who have test-driven the helmet, linemen in particular, have said they "don't feel the impact as much" when they are tackled.\u000a\u000a"It's really encouraging," he said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aAdded Baldwin: "There's a lot of concerns out there amongst parents and adults about their children being safe on the football field. We [have] introduced a piece of equipment that is going to make the game safer, make their youth safer, prolong their careers in the NFL, in high school or college or wherever it may be.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you have something sustainable \u2026 that's going to bring back the attention to the fun of the sport, and not necessarily the risks of the sport. It's going to help prevent injuries."

aVA Walmart pharmacy in Oklahoma is reportedly under investigation after a woman accused the store of mixing three different prescriptions into one pill bottle.\u000a\u000aGina McCurtain filled a prescription in early July following a recent shoulder surgery. She told KFOR that there were two other similar looking pills inside her prescription bottle, which she claims to have taken for around two weeks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI started getting real fast heartbeat, didn\u2019t know why,\u201d McCurtain said.\u000a\u000aMcCurtain, a diabetic, told the news station that her first prescription of Percocet filled by the pharmacy inside the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Oklahoma City was correct. In late July, McCurtain and her husband noticed there were different pills in the bottle from a prescription filled on July 11, according to KFOR.\u000a\u000aWALMART APOLOGIZES FOR 'OWN THE SCHOOL YEAR LIKE A HERO' GUN DISPLAY SIGN\u000a\u000aWhen the woman took the pills back to the Walmart pharmacy on July 25, the muscle relaxant Methocarbamol and anti-depressant Bupropion were found mixed in with the Percocet.\u000a\u000aMcCurtain told the news station she was once prescribed Bupropion, but the milligram prescribed was different than the one she found intermixed. She also said she disposes of pills she no longer takes.\u000a\u000aIn a statement to KFOR, Senior Corporate Communications Manager Charles Crowson said the accused pharmacy couldn\u2019t confirm McCurtain\u2019s claim.\u000a\u000a"We work hard to ensure that we live up to the high standards we\u2019ve set for ourselves and that our customers have come to expect. We have quality control processes in place to help ensure our customers receive the correct medications. We reviewed this situation and after speaking with associates, examining store video and discussing the matter with the customer, we could not confirm her claim. In fact, two of the drugs returned to our store came from a supplier we do not use at this store\u2019s pharmacy. We take this seriously and remain open to discussing this further with our customer if she has any additional information on this incident."\u000a\u000aN-WORD USED ON WALMART WEBSITE TO DESCRIBE PRODUCT COLOR\u000a\u000aMcCurtain has since filed a complaint with the Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy, KFOR reported.\u000a\u000aThe board\u2019s executive director said situations like this are a \u201cpriority,\u201d and that incorrectly filled prescriptions are rare and not easy to prove.\u000a\u000aThe director said she sent the complaint to a compliance officer and will \u201chopefully\u201d have answers in the upcoming week.

aVIt would be one thing for President Trump to threaten \u201cfire and fury\u201d if Congress were in session right now.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCongress is on the traditional August recess, however, as Trump bolsters his language against North Korea, warning not only of \u201cfire and fury\u201d but of an unprecedented response if Pyongyang follows through on any threat to hit Guam, a U.S. territory.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut imagine if Congress were huddling in Washington at this time instead of lawmakers spread to the four winds for the August recess.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPandemonium would engulf Capitol Hill. There would be fiery speeches on the House and Senate floors. News conferences. Lawmakers would demand emergency, classified briefings from senior officials.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAre we going to war? What if someone makes a miscalculation? What if everyone overplays their hands?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aReporters would stake out lawmakers at every Capitol Hill outpost. The basement of the Russell Senate Office Building. The Senate subway tunnel leading to the Capitol. The corridor between Statuary Hall and the House chamber. The elevator hallways near the House and Senate floors. The Speaker\u2019s Lobby.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe gravity would multiply. Members of Congress would weigh in \u2013 or be forced to weigh in \u2013 and take positions about North Korea, the administration\u2019s stance, the president\u2019s approach and \u2013 shock, what lawmakers should do about all of this.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke to senators just last week about the possibility of a revamped, congressional authorization to combat ISIS -- the authorizations the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations use to justify fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and even the Philippines date back to 2001 and 2002. The Constitution grants Congress the right to declare war, not the president. Considering the global consequences, one might think Congress ought to bless any operation involving North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAlas, Trump\u2019s fulmination about North Korea came with barely a lawmaker in Washington due to the congressional break. Sure, some lawmakers showed up on TV to comment on Trump ratcheting up tensions with Pyongyang. And telephones still work for interviews.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome members of Congress dismissed Trump\u2019s invective as a sure way to supercharge the conflict rather than calm things down.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHowever, this all went down with Congress out of session. That altered the dynamic dramatically.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMany Republicans, exhausted from trying to clarify, defend and interpret the president\u2019s off-hand remarks and pre-dawn tweets, were more than happy to be away from the Capitol and not comment. Meantime, Democrats saw this as President Trump again simply being President Trump: spitting sulfuric language much the way he\u2019s been known to vent about TV hosts.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd then in the middle of it all, Trump announced on Twitter he was formally endorsing Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., in the Alabama primary next week over Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore. It seemed odd for the president to momentarily drop North Korea and descend into electoral politics to publicly endorse Strange. The endorsement of Strange came at the same time many wondered if they were about to witness a real-time screening of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, sidestepped Trump\u2019s bombast and focused on troops who could be called to war.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is time for Congress to stand up with them and provide the equipment, training and resources they need and deserve,\u201d said Thornberry. \u201cThe House has already acted to increase funding for our troops, including more funds for missile defense systems that could play an important role on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVoluble Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., published a remarkably efficient statement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to be firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe,\u201d said Schumer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy contrast, scribes in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., published three full paragraphs about Trump and North Korea.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThe President's most recent comments are recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cHis saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility and weaken our ability to reach a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and must immediately end.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOf course, now there\u2019s word that North Korea may attempt to move against the U.S. territory of Guam located 2,100 miles south of Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGuam\u2019s non-voting representative to Congress, Del. Madeleine Bordallo, initially declared that North Korea\u2019s threats were \u201ctroubling.\u201d But Bordallo asserted she was \u201cconfident that Guam remains safe and protected.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLess than 12 hours later, Bordallo circulated another statement. This one sounded more dire.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s most recent threat to target Guam is dangerous and it further heightens tensions in our region,\u201d said Bordallo.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aShe also took notice of Trump\u2019s antagonism. \u201cI strongly urge the President to explore every avenue to peacefully respond to it and avoid further escalating this situation,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, she said Trump \u201cneeds to tone down the rhetoric.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCircumstances would be more kinetic if Congress were meeting amid the pounding of the war drums. Don\u2019t forget that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell initially said his body would meet this week. But the Kentucky Republican dashed those plans after the Senate stumbled on health care and forged an agreement to confirm a slate of Trump\u2019s nominees, stalled for weeks by Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInstead it is August. Congress has gone fishin\u2019.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 2013, lawmakers rushed back to Washington a few days early for special briefings on the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to strike Syria. But the plan never gained traction despite a parade of lawmakers trouping through the Capitol before the end of the recess. Congress never formally considered any military plan for Syria. Without a congressional blessing, the Obama administration moved only incrementally against the Syrian regime as the ISIS problem multiplied.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSo everyone is left now with Trump\u2019s threatening to unleash \u201cfire and fury.\u201d It means a lot on the global stage.

Just don't ask them to define it, because you'll get the same answer.\u000a\u000aLast year, a poll was released showing 53 percent of Americans under age 35 are dissatisfied with our nation\u2019s current economic system and think socialism would be good for the country.\u000a\u000aThe same poll found that 45 percent of young Americans would be willing to support an openly socialist Presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aThe findings of this poll coincide with the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, an avowed \u201cDemocratic Socialist\u201d from Vermont who received millions of votes in the 2016 Democratic Primary, many of them from millennials.\u000a\u000aWhile it\u2019s clear that young people increasingly view socialism in a positive light, it\u2019s also clear that many of them are uneducated about what it entails, or the impact it\u2019s had throughout history.\u000a\u000aThe same poll found many millennials are unfamiliar with historical figures often associated with socialism, such as Che Guevara, Joseph Stalin, and Karl Marx.\u000a\u000aWanting to see what millennials in D.C. thought of socialism, Campus Reform headed to Washington, D.C. to ask students two simple questions: \u201cDo you like socialism?\u201d and \u201cWhat is socialism?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt quickly became clear that while most of the people we spoke with held an idyllic view of socialism, most had little idea of what it actually is.

aVA carved human bone from an archaeological dig in the U.K. is offering new insight into the grisly culture of prehistoric cannibals.\u000a\u000aThe forearm bone discovered at Gough\u2019s Cave in Somerset, western England, had been filleted, then marked with bizarre zig-zag pattern before being broken open to extract the bone marrow, scientists say.\u000a\u000aThe bone was excavated in 1987 by a team led by paleontologists from the Natural History Museum in London. New analysis has revealed the artifact\u2019s gruesome secrets.\u000a\u000aTEMPLE OF DOOM: GRISLY 'SKULL CULT' DISCOVERY AT ANCIENT SITE\u000a\u000aExperts describe the radius bone\u2019s \u201ccut marks, percussion damage and human tooth marks, indicative of cannibalism, as well as a set of unusual zig-zagging incisions,\u201d in a paper published in the journal Plos One.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe human remains date from around 14,700 years ago, when the cave was occupied by the Ice Age Britons, according to the Natural History Museum in London. During their initial excavation of the site, researchers found human bones mixed with butchered animal remains and flint, bone and ivory artifacts.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sequence of modifications performed on this bone suggests that the engraving was a purposeful component of the cannibalistic practice, rich in symbolic connotations,\u201d explained Dr. Silvia Bello, researcher in human origins at the Museum and lead author of the study, in a statement.\u000a\u000aDNA DISCOVERY UNRAVELS THE MYSTERY OF EARLY GREEK CIVILIZATIONS\u000a\u000aEarlier research carried out by the Museum has established that the cave\u2019s inhabitants were cannibals. Scratches and marks on the human bones show that they were butchered in the same way and using the same tools as animal bones. Many of the human bones show human teeth marks, and have been broken open so that the marrow could be extracted, the Museum explained. Bone marrow is rich in protein and fat.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, there is no indication on the skeletons that the humans had suffered violence, so it is likely that they died of natural causes,\u201d the Museum said, in its statement. \u201cWhile the exact intent of the inhabitants' cannibalistic practices will never be certain, previous discoveries already suggested that it was not simply a matter of cannibalism for survival.\u201d\u000a\u000aExperts note that some of the skulls discovered in the cave show evidence of being carefully modified to produce skull-cups, rather than roughly stripped of their flesh. \u201cThe craniums were removed from the rest of the skull and rough edges chipped off to produce bowl-like objects, showing that the living inhabitants were not just treating the deceased as food,\u201d explained the Museum.\u000a\u000aTEENAGER\u2019S DISCOVERY OF ROMAN TREASURE TROVE DELIGHTS EXPERTS\u000a\u000aResearchers used a microscope to study the marks on the forearm bone made by stone tools. By employing three-dimensional analysis they were able to work out which marks were the results of butchery and which were the results of engraving.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe engravings were likely made in one sitting by a single individual, using one tool.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sequence of the manipulations strongly suggests that the engraving was an intrinsic part of the multi-stage cannibalistic ritual and, as such, the marks must have held a symbolic connotation,\u201d said Dr. Bello. \u201cArchaeologists have linked the engraving of objects and tools to ways of remembering events, places or circumstances, a sort of \u2018written memory\u2019 and \u2018symbolic glue\u2019 that held together complex social groups.\u201d\u000a\u000a'ALESI,' THE 13-MILLION-YEAR-OLD BABY MONKEY, COULD BE MANKIND\u2019S EARLIEST ANCESTOR\u000a\u000aThe zig-zag patterns indicate that they may have been made by the Magdalenians, a prehistoric culture that lived across Western Europe. The Gough\u2019s Cave artifact is the earliest examples of an engraved human bone, according to the archaeologists.\u000a\u000aThis is the latest grisly archaeological revelation. Archaeologists in Turkey, for example, recently revealed that human skulls may have once decorated an ancient temple at Göbekli Tepe.

aVJournalist and baseball lover Ed Henry reveals for the first time the backstory of faith that guided Jackie Robinson into not only the baseball record books but the annals of civil rights advancement as well. Through recently discovered sermons, interviews with Robinson\u2019s family and friends, and even an unpublished book by the player himself, Henry details a side of Jackie\u2019s humanity that few have taken the time to see.\u000a\u000aBranch Rickey, the famed owner who risked it all by signing Jackie to his first contract, is also shown as a complex individual who wanted nothing more than to make his God-fearing mother proud of him. Few know the level at which Rickey struggled with his decision, only moving forward after a private meeting with a minister he\u2019d just met. It turns out Rickey was not as certain about signing Robinson as historians have always assumed.\u000a\u000aWith many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized.\u000a\u000aThis book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson\u2019s already awe-inspiring legacy. Yes, Jackie and Branch are both still heroes long after their deaths. Now, we learn more fully than ever before, there was an assist from God too.

Eddie Calvo dismissed the North\u2019s statements, saying they came from a \u201cpositon of fear,\u201d Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday the North Korean state-run media agency, KCNA, released a statement saying the communist nation would complete its plan to attack waters near Guam within just a week, adding that the action against Guam would be "an effective remedy for restraining the frantic moves of the U.S. in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity."\u000a\u000aThe statement followed a tweet by President Trump praising what he described as the growing U.S. nuclear arsenal, adding, \u201cHopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea dismissed Trump\u2019s recent threat of \u2018\u201dfire and fury\u201d as a \u201cload of nonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalvo went on to say that while there is some concern among the public, there are defense mechanisms in place:\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a defense umbrella contained within South Korea, there is a defense umbrella for Japan, there are naval assets between Korea, Japan and Guam, and there is a missile defense system of Guam that make up a multi-level defensive umbrella.\u201d\u000a\u000aGuam is home to a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group, Reuters reported, as well as 163,000 residents.

aVLack of a new education funding formula prevented Illinois on Thursday from sending hundreds of millions of dollars to 852 public school districts, punching a hole in their budgets just weeks before classes start.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aGovernor Bruce Rauner's use of a veto this month to rewrite a funding formula bill stopped the twice-monthly August-to-June flow of state aid to schools totaling $6.7 billion in fiscal 2018.\u000a\u000a"The fact that these payments are not being made threatens the opening of schools in some districts, is causing cuts to be made to educational services to children and unfortunately is a reflection of the political gridlock and dysfunction in our state," said Roger Eddy, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards.\u000a\u000aAn impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left Illinois without a complete budget for an unprecedented two fiscal years. Lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget in July over Rauner's vetoes.\u000a\u000aThe initial fiscal 2018 state-aid payment schools were scheduled to receive on Thursday was the first Illinois ever missed, according to state Comptroller Susana Mendoza. To ease the blow, her office distributed $429 million in grants that schools were owed in March for transportation and other costs.\u000a\u000aThe comptroller's office said schools received about $244 million twice a month in state aid in fiscal 2017, which ended June 30. It was unclear how much the initial fiscal 2018 payment would be because of the lack of a funding formula.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aThe school grants had been delayed as Illinois' unpaid bill backlog ballooned to over $15 billion.\u000a\u000aRauner has called for quick action by the General Assembly to accept his changes to the bill, which was passed in May without a veto-proof majority, or to send him separate legislation reflecting what he wants so school operations will not be threatened.\u000a\u000aThe Senate is scheduled to take up school funding on Sunday, while the House returns to session on Wednesday. Failure by the two chambers to muster a required three-fifths majority vote to override or accept changes Rauner made to the bill would kill the measure.\u000a\u000aEddy said without state aid, some districts may be able to keep their doors open only for weeks, while others will be forced to tap reserves or borrowing to keep operating.\u000a\u000aThe cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, the main target of Rauner's veto action, will start classes in September and will remain open for the school year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aFitch Ratings warned last week that some districts, including junk-rated CPS, could face credit downgrades in the event of an extended school funding impasse.\u000a\u000a(Reporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Dan Grebler)

Trump does deserve some credit for the soaring stock market.\u000a\u000aAs of Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had scored record highs for nine days in a row; the gains are driving anti-Trumpers crazy. Though the president\u2019s boasts are not always accurate, lapses the New York Times eagerly documents, his recent tweet celebrating the Dow passing 22,000 for the first time is on the mark.\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is correct: it doesn\u2019t just happen. That doesn\u2019t mean the liberal media will stand down from their incessant anti-Trump alarmism and admit that his pro-business policies might be boosting economic growth or doing the country some good.\u000a\u000aHence, recent pieces have dredged up other reasons for the gains in stocks, many of which are valid. Earnings gains have indeed been above expectations; there is vast monetary stimulus around the world, we see renewed growth in China and Europe and a weakening dollar; all those elements and more have played a role.\u000a\u000aBut, they are not the entire story.

The gesture that he made last year when he took the stand to do what he did, listen, we all appreciated it, we respected it, and it was a good thing.

aVPolice in Broward County, Fla., are searching for a group of teenage boys who pulled off an alarming prank just after July Fourth.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office released surveillance footage from the night of the July 5 incident, in which an unidentified suspect tosses a lit firework into the Wendy\u2019s restaurant in Deerfield Beach. Seconds later, the firework explodes in a hail of flaming projectiles directly behind an unsuspecting employee, leaving a cloud of smoke in its wake.\u000a\u000aWENDY'S IN EPIC SIGN WAR WITH TEA SHOP ACROSS THE STREET\u000a\u000a\u201cIt could have set the restaurant on fire or it could have burned the woman by the door,\u201d said Joy Oglesby, a spokesperson for the Broward Sherriff\u2019s Office, to the Sun Sentinel. \u201cIt definitely could have been a situation where we had injuries or deaths.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe employee, whom deputies identified as a 20-year-old woman, was able to flee from the blast uninjured, but the firework did end up blasting a 7-inch hole through the wall of the restaurant, the Sentinel reports.\u000a\u000aHowever, a nearby businessman told WSVN said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Wendy\u2019s worker was a little shaken from the explosion.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour initial reaction is gonna be, \u2018Oh my god! A bomb!\u201d said Ken Spears, who runs a neighboring flower shop. \u201cAnything that loud, and that sudden.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office believes the crime was committed by around eight to ten boys, who were later spotted fleeing through the Wendy\u2019s parking lot. Police are confident they live near the establishment, too.\u000a\u000aFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do understand that this happened just after Fourth of July, but there was no cause or reason for these individuals to throw a firework into the restaurant,\u201d added Oglesby.\u000a\u000aWendy's, meanwhile, tells Fox News that the restaurant is thankful no one was physically harmed.\u000a\u000a"We are very grateful that no one was injured, and the damage to the restaurant was minimal," wrote Wendy's in a statement.

aVBy MICHAEL WHITNEY, Politico\u000a\u000aHalfway through Year One of the Trump presidency, the Democratic base is energized. Its voters are showing up at rallies, crowding town hall forums, self-organizing into local groups and scaring Republican incumbents: If Democrats turn out to vote in the 2018 midterms at the same levels they have in 2017\u2019s special elections, the party will pick up 80 seats in the U.S. House.

aVPresident Trump Thursday raised the possibility of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., resigning his post if McConnell fails to get the president's agenda through the Senate.\u000a\u000a"If he doesn't get repeal and replace [of ObamaCare] done, and if he doesn't get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question," Trump told reporters outside his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. in response to a question about whether McConnell should step down.\u000a\u000aTrump made the comments hours after posting a message on Twitter telling McConnell to "get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing.\u000a\u000a"You can do it!" the tweet concluded.\u000a\u000aThe president's ongoing salvos against McConnell appear to be in response to the Senate Majority Leader's remark in his home state this week that Trump had "excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process." They also give voice to a segment of the Republican base who are out to punish what they see as a "do-nothing Congress" that has hampered the president's goals.\u000a\u000aDoug Deason, a major donor based in Texas who said he decided months ago not to give money to any Republicans up for re-election next year unless they can pass Trump's priorities, described McConnell to the Associated Press as "a coward who leads from behind," ''spineless," and a lifelong "political animal" of the sort Trump wants to eject from Washington.\u000a\u000aBut McConnell's supporters saw Trump's moves as counterproductive.\u000a\u000a"Virtually any substantial goals that the president intends to achieve, whether it is tax reform or more infrastructure, requires the active assistance of the Senate majority leader," said Michael Steel, who was spokesman to former House Speaker John Boehner.\u000a\u000aEven Newt Gingrich, a Trump backer and informal adviser who formerly served as speaker of the House, criticized the dispute.\u000a\u000a"You saw Mitch McConnell say something, you saw Trump say something, when it's obviously better for them to learn not to do that," Gingrich said. "They have to work together. Governing is a team sport."\u000a\u000a"The leader has spoken repeatedly about the path forward regarding Obamacare repeal and replace on the Senate floor, at media availabilities and in Kentucky," McConnell spokesman David Popp said Thursday before Trump's comments.\u000a\u000aTrump, 71, and McConnell, 75, have never been easy allies, even though the senator's wife, Elaine Chao, is the president's transportation secretary. McConnell only met Trump for the first time in 2013, when he made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower in New York to ask the businessman for campaign money.\u000a\u000aBut McConnell quickly boarded the Trump train once the mogul secured the GOP nomination, and unlike House Speaker Paul Ryan and others, he never wavered. He's paid numerous visits to the White House this year and traveled with Trump in March to Louisville. That Trump rally predated all of Congress' attempts to redo health care, and the president urged the crowd to "be nice" to McConnell.\u000a\u000aFast forward to August, with the Senate on recess after the collapse of the GOP health care bill.\u000a\u000aBrent Bozell, a longtime McConnell detractor and president of the conservative social media group For America, said the Senate leader had made a ridiculous argument that will haunt him.\u000a\u000a"By calling President Trump a political neophyte, McConnell is saying that Trump doesn't understand that Congress doesn't keep its promises," Bozell said. "This is exactly why Trump won \u2014 to shake up Washington, and that includes Republicans."\u000a\u000aAnd yet, in opening a door he might want to try to shove McConnell out of, Trump once against demonstrated his naivete in Washington's ways. A Senate majority leader is elected by members of his own conference, and McConnell has plenty of support within his, regardless of anything Trump may say about it.\u000a\u000aSen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior lawmaker and vocal Trump backer, said over Twitter that McConnell "has been the best leader we've had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges. I fully support him."\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVCNN announced Thursday that it has officially cut all ties with commentator Jeffrey Lord. The news comes after a controversial tweet prompted many of his more liberal critics to demand the network let him go.\u000a\u000aThe trouble started when Lord got into a spat on Twitter with Angela Carusone, president of Media Matters, a group he\u2019s brushed up against in the past. Lord tweeted \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d at Carusone, a popular salute used by the Nazis in World War II.\u000a\u000a\u201cNazi salutes are indefensible,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cJeffrey Lord is no longer with the network.\u201d\u000a\u000aLord is a former Reagan administration staffer who is currently a columnist for the conservative magazine The American Spectator. He was brought on to CNN in 2015 as one of the first fully pro Donald Trump commentators after the then candidate first entered the GOP primary race. The network has since expanded its pro-Trump panels after the election.\u000a\u000aWhile Lord maintains that his use of the Nazi phrase was an effort to mock both Nazis and fascists, many still find his reasoning unsatisfactory. In the same thread, he responded to outrage saying, \u201cYou apparently take offense at mocking Nazis and Fascists. Wow.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Anne Frank Center tweeted a rebuke of Lord\u2019s use of the phrase.\u000a\u000aAs Variety notes, the Trump administration has made CNN a target for criticism, forcing it to shift and adjust its relationships to on-air personalities like the 61-year-old Lord quite frequently.

Eddie Calvo dismissed the North\u2019s statements, saying they came from a \u201cpositon of fear,\u201d Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday the North Korean state-run media agency, KCNA, released a statement saying the communist nation would complete its plan to attack waters near Guam within just a week, adding that the action against Guam would be "an effective remedy for restraining the frantic moves of the U.S. in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity."\u000a\u000aThe statement followed a tweet by President Trump praising what he described as the growing U.S. nuclear arsenal, adding, \u201cHopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea dismissed Trump\u2019s recent threat of \u2018\u201dfire and fury\u201d as a \u201cload of nonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalvo went on to say that while there is some concern among the public, there are defense mechanisms in place:\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a defense umbrella contained within South Korea, there is a defense umbrella for Japan, there are naval assets between Korea, Japan and Guam, and there is a missile defense system of Guam that make up a multi-level defensive umbrella.\u201d\u000a\u000aGuam is home to a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group, Reuters reported, as well as 163,000 residents.

aVOfficials in New Orleans urged residents Thursday to move their vehicles to higher ground in certain neighborhoods, amid continued problems with the city's water pumps that has forced two officials out -- as more rain is due.\u000a\u000aMayor Mitch Landrieu's office said in a news release the city has lost service to one of its turbines, which powers most of the pumping stations that service the East Bank of New Orleans.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the power outage, the system\u2019s capacity to drain storm water from the streets is diminished. Currently, five of the sewerage and water board's six turbines are out of service, according to FOX 8. All but two were out of service before the fire and resulting otage.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe lone turbine, along with power from Entergy, can still power 38 of the city\u2019s 58 available pumps located west of the Industrial Canal, city officials said at a press conference.\u000a\u000a"We are at risk if we have a massive rain event that comes up at the last minute and creates the kind of flooding we had," Landrieu told reporters, referring to flooding the city experienced during the weekend. "The power we have available to us now will not be enough to pump the city out in the time needed."\u000a\u000aThe mayor said the city will be vulnerable for the next 24 to 48 hours, FOX8 reported.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis could be as early as later [Thursday], or it could be longer. We just do not know yet,\u201d Landrieu said.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe Orleans Parish School Board closed schools and its central administrative offices Thursday because of diminished pumping capacity, according to FOX 8.\u000a\u000aLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference he signed a declaration of emergency "out of an abundance of caution."\u000a\u000a"This is a serious situation," he said, but stressed now is not the time to panic.\u000a\u000aThe city's municipal pumping system is supposed to move water out of the low-lying city, and is separate from the $14.5 billion spent in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, as reported in the New York Times, to construct levees, flood walls, gates and pumps to block storm surge from tropical systems.\u000a\u000aThe Gulf Coast is in the middle of hurricane season, and thunderstorms are also prevalent in New Orleans during August.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aCrews were on site Thursday working to repair the downed turbine and secure backup power to restore power to the pumping stations, FOX8 reported.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are going to do everything in our power to secure this additional equipment and to get the plant back in order," Landrieu said.\u000a\u000aDue to the potentially severe weather that could result from high water, residents were being told to call 911 to report street flooding and life-threatening emergencies. Residents were also being advised to remain indoors during heavy rainfall.\u000a\u000a"The chief has been instructed to make sure that the police department is ready and prepared in the case that we need them. Chief McConnell has been instructed to have the fire department ready," Landrieu said.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, city officials said the water-pumping system was fully operational, and all 24 pumping stations were working at full capacity.\u000a\u000aBut after the system failed to keep up with a storm during the weekend that dropped 9.4 inches of rain in three hours, the truth about the state of the water pumps began to emerge.\u000a\u000aDespite what the public had been led to believe, city council members were then told that pumping stations in two of the hardest-hit areas went down to half- to two-thirds capacity on Saturday, according to FOX8.\u000a\u000a"It is unacceptable that the public was not only uninformed, but misinformed as to our drainage system functionality during the flood," Council Member LaToya Cantrell said in a statement Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe disclosure has had a ripple effect on the water authority, NOLA.com reported.\u000a\u000aCedric Grant, one of Mayor Mitch Landrieu's top deputies and the head of the Sewerage & Water Board, told the city council at the start of its meeting Tuesday he would retire at the end of hurricane season, which lasts through November.\u000a\u000aPublic Works Director Mark Jernigan submitted his resignation shortly after the meeting, when he was asked whether his agency had done enough to clean the catch basins that feed the drainage system.\u000a\u000aLandrieu said he also wanted the board to fire Joseph Becker, the Sewerage & Water Board's general superintendent.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

On Wednesday the band will play in Israel for the first time in 17 years.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also the first time since the 2005 emergence of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement, created by Western pro-Palestinian activists as a means of punishing Israel through academic and cultural boycotts not only of the country but of Israeli artists and academics who perform or speak abroad.\u000a\u000aRock stars garner far more media attention than academics, of course, so trying to prevent bands from playing in Israel is a key component of isolating Israel not just politically but culturally. To see Israeli fans rejected by their heroes.\u000a\u000aThus it was a major public scandal to Western activists (particularly in Europe) to find out that Radiohead wasn\u2019t on board with it.\u000a\u000aRadiohead\u2019s history with Israel is surprisingly longstanding and deep, on both a professional and personal level.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\u000a\u000aThe similarities between the pair led to David regularly landing a guest spot on "Saturday Night Live" impersonating the former Democratic presidential candidate during the lead-up to the 2016 elections. They then starred alongside each other in an episode in February 2016.\u000a\u000a"He's in the line ... like a third cousin, or something," David said at the event promoting the next season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm." "I was very happy about that. I figured there was some connection."

aVA restaurateur in Michigan recently tried out a new approach on two immigration agents who wanted to search her cafe: She told them to go away.\u000a\u000aHediye Batu, who co-owns Café Zola in Ann Arbor with her husband Alan Zakalik, reportedly turned away two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who came in to inquire about an employee of theirs on Wednesday afternoon, MLive.com reports.\u000a\u000aICE AGENTS EAT BREAKFAST, THEN RAID KITCHEN OF ANN ARBOR RESTAURANT\u000a\u000aAccording to Zakalik, who was not present at the time, the worker in question was not on duty, but Batu refused to let the agents look around anyway. They reportedly left the premises soon afterward.\u000a\u000a"I was not around when they came in but they did speak to my wife, and she refused them entry," he told MLive. "They wanted to go through the kitchen.\u201d\u000a\u000aZakalik added that the men were carrying weapons and looked \u201cpretty equipped\u201d in their ICE gear \u2014 a sight that wasn\u2019t lost on his customers.\u000a\u000a"These few people who did notice, they didn't like the intimidation factor when people come in with guns," said Zakalik of the patrons he spoke with.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant\u2019s ICE visit also comes at a time when Ann Arbor restaurateurs are noticing a marked increase in ICE\u2019s activity in the city, MLive reported late last month. On July 28, several of these restaurant owners and workers gathered together with activists and local officials to discuss the impact it\u2019s had, with some officials reportedly arguing that ICE is making their community worse by tearing apart families.\u000a\u000aPIZZA WARS: WHY DOMINO'S COULD SURPASS PIZZA HUT AS AN INDUSTRY LEADER\u000a\u000aThe owner of Sava\u2019s, another Ann Arbor eatery, shared similar sentiments shortly after her own interaction with ICE in late May, after they ate at her restaurant before charging into the kitchen.\u000a\u000a"It scares the whole community. Today's a great indication even if you have your documentation, and you're at the wrong place at the wrong time, you can still be at risk," she said at the time.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for ICE was not immediately available for comment, but the agency confirmed to MLive that no arrests were made at Café Zola on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"Today's enforcement operations are a part of routine, daily targeted operations conducted by ICE in this region and around the country every day, targeting criminal aliens and other immigration violators," the agency stated.

aVAutumn 1944. World War II is nearly over in Europe but is escalating in the Pacific, where American soldiers face an opponent who will go to any length to avoid defeat. The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. Killing the Rising Sun takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, Killing Patton, and Killing Reagan, this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis | Fox News\u000a\u000aFact: The United States and its allies in the Asia-Pacific would demolish North Korea in any conceivable military scenario. Even if our worst fears are realized, and Kim Jong Un decided to lash out with nuclear weapons, Washington would ensure Pyongyang was turned into atomic ash\u2014what would clearly be the end of the so-called \u201chermit kingdom\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut what is lost in our recent conversations of war and peace in Asia today are two key questions: Just how bad would such a conflict be and what happens when the war is over?\u000a\u000aStop and think about it for a second. If we accept the fact that a war fought on the Korean peninsula -- if waged with no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, which is by no means a certainty\u2014it stands to reason that the number of conventional weapons used by North and South Korea, America and likely Japan or others would flatten large sections of the Korea peninsula. To make matters worse, such carnage would likely spread to the Japanese home islands, U.S. military bases around the region or even Guam, Hawaii or Alaska.\u000a\u000aTo focus our minds around this terrifying problem, let us consider for a moment just one of the many very real scenarios that could occur in what would be a Second Korean War. If, for example, North Korea were to launch a salvo of artillery shells into Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital\u2014just a mere 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates north and south\u2014the devastation could be catastrophic. Imagine countless skyscrapers and tall buildings collapsing to the earth, millions of people fleeing to mass transit and clogging all exits out of one of the world\u2019s largest cities. It would be, in many respects, 9/11\u2014but times a hundred. The rebuilding of downtown Seoul would be in the billions of dollars, not to mention the rebuilding of countless people\u2019s lives. Just that one act alone, in what could be the opening chapter of a war the brutality of which we have not seen in generations\u2014not to mention would be magnified on social media many times over\u2014would horrify us all for generations to come.

aVNorth Korea and President Trump lashed out at each other within hours on Tuesday, in both cases threatening to hit the other side with a barrage of "fire." The threats, between the North Korean Army and Trump, came shortly after a report that the regime has produced a compact nuclear warhead that could fit on a missile capable of reaching the United States. Speaking at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey, Trump vowed to unleash "fire" and "fury." He said that North Korea's threats of nuclear war "will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before." He continued, saying that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un "has been threatening beyond a normal state," and added that the communist country "best not make any more threats to the United States." North Korea soon fired back with a threat of its own. The Korean People's Army claimed in a statement that it was looking into a plan to hit Guam, a U.S. territory, with missiles that would create an "enveloping fire" around the island. The threat was released by state-run media, and said the purpose of striking Guam would be to subdue the U.S. military bases there, particularly the Anderson Air Force base where nuclear-bombers are stationed.\u000a\u000aDr. Robert Jeffress, Senior Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas joined the Todd Starnes Show after releasing a statement saying, "God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un."\u000a\u000aDr. Robert Jeffress on if he believes the President has some sort of authority from the "almighty" to take out Kim Jong Un:\u000a\u000aAbsolutely, and the reason I've issued this statement, and it's caused quite a bit of controversy over the last twenty four hours, the reason I did this is I knew the president's comments about fire and fury would be met with fire in fury, not just from the left but from misguided Christians who really don't understand what the bible says about the use of force. And I've made it very clear the bible gives President Trump the moral authority to use whatever force necessary, including assassination or war, to deal with evil doers like Kim Jong Un. And gratefully, thankfully we have a president who understands that and a president who when he draws a red line will not erase it, move It, or back away from it and it's that kind of decisive leadership that the bible calls for from our government leaders.\u000a\u000aDr. Robert Jeffress on his confidence in President Trump regarding North Korea:\u000a\u000aI've been with him in a variety of settings, we've talked about a variety of issues. I know that the president is a very measured, a very sober individual when it comes to making difficult decisions. I mean he has a certain persona in public, but in private he is very, very thoughtful. He doesn't do anything, he doesn't say anything, he doesn't tweet anything without great thought ahead of time. Everything is for a reason even though we may not understand what the reason is. So I have the utmost confidence in his leadership and his ability to handle a situation like this.\u000a\u000aListen to the full interview below:

aVBy The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d Tuesday if it continues to menace the U.S. with nuclear weapons, he provoked almost as much backlash at home as in Pyongyang. The usual diplomatic suspects, including some American lawmakers, claimed his remarks hurt U.S. credibility and were irresponsible.\u000a\u000aThe President\u2019s point was that the North\u2019s escalating threats are intolerable; he didn\u2019t set any red lines. True to form, Pyongyang responded by putting the U.S. island of Guam in its cross hairs. Mr. Trump may be guilty of hyperbole (quelle surprise), but that is far less damaging to U.S. credibility than Barack Obama\u2019s failure to enforce his prohibition on the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons in Syria. The foreign-policy elite who claim to be shocked also don\u2019t have much credibility after their policy across three Administrations led to the current North Korean danger.\u000a\u000aWhile the President\u2019s words were unusually colorful, the Communist-style language may have been part of the message: Kim Jong Un isn\u2019t the only one who can raise the geopolitical temperature. The U.S. has military options to neutralize the regime\u2019s nuclear threat if it continues to develop long-range missiles, and the U.S. is considering those options.

aVWhile the world continues to be fascinated with the life and works of the late Princess Diana, two of the most important figures in her life are finally opening up about her tragic death. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry will sit down on camera to discuss the days following their mother\u2019s death in a new documentary.\u000a\u000aNBC will air a two hour examination of the tumultuous week following the death of Diana, specifically how it impacted her sons and the role they played in helping their country mourn in the aftermath. \u201cDiana, 7 Days\u201d is set to air in September to help mark the 20 year anniversary of her death.\u000a\u000aPRINCESS DIANA BIOGRAPHER SPECULATES ON WHY SHE CHOSE HIM\u000a\u000a\u201cPart of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,\u201d Prince William said in a statement released by the network. \u201cI think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn\u2019t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.\u201d\u000a\u000aNEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PRINCESS DIANA CREATES STIR\u000a\u000aWilliam\u2019s brother, Harry, echoed those sentiments, saying, \u201cWhen she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking. It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you\u2019re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it\u2019s lodged in here, there, wherever \u2013 in your heart, in your head and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it\u2019s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe documentary also promises interviews with family, close friends, political figures and journalists.

aVMiami-Dade County invited the fury of activists when it became the first in the nation to give up its \u201csanctuary\u201d status for illegal immigrants \u2013 but the decision, it seems, might be paying off.\u000a\u000aRepublican Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he has received a letter from Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Alan Hanson confirming the county\u2019s compliance, a requirement to receive certain DOJ funding. As a result, he announced the county remains \u201celigible\u201d for a nearly half-million dollar grant.\u000a\u000aThe statement appeared to refer to an existing grant, noting the money already is being used to boost the local police department\u2019s \u201cintelligence gathering and police operations with investments in technology and specialized equipment.\u201d But the DOJ letter indicates the county\u2019s immigration decision could clear the way for future funding as well.\u000a\u000aGimenez\u2019s decision to drop the county\u2019s sanctuary city status in January sparked outrage at the time from local immigrant advocates who accused the Cuban-born mayor of betraying the county\u2019s tradition of welcoming immigrants.\u000a\u000aA few days later, the county commission rejected emotional pleas by some residents and voted 9-3 to support the mayor\u2019s decision.\u000a\u000aThe commission said it sided with Gimenez because of threats made by the Trump administration to withhold federal funding from cities and counties refusing to cooperate with federal immigration officials to deport people living in the country illegally. The DOJ letter could serve as a message to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country that cooperation means funding.\u000a\u000aIt comes as cities like Chicago and New York are openly fighting the Trump administration over the policy.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel sued the Trump administration \u2013 naming Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a defendant \u2013 over the funding threats, prompting the Department of Justice to accuse Emanuel of caring more about protecting illegal immigrants than legal residents in his city.\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cChicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated. And Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\u000a\u000aChicago stands to lose $3.2 million from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants for refusing to cooperate with the feds.\u000a\u000aWhile the showdown over sanctuary cities has been heating up in recent months, a number of smaller communities have quietly shed their status. They include: Dayton, Ohio; Saratoga, N.Y.; Bedford, Pa.; and Finney County, Kan.\u000a\u000aLast month, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement also announced that 18 counties in Texas had agreed to work with federal agents to review the immigration status of inmates in their local jails and turn over those suspected of immigration violations.\u000a\u000aThe 287(g) agreement trains local law enforcement to check if people they have in custody are in violation of U.S. immigration law. The 20-year-old program has expanded under Trump.\u000a\u000aSixty communities now have active 287(g) agreements \u2013 twice as many as a year ago, according to ICE officials.

aVBy Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, the Trump Department of Justice told the mayor of Chicago that it would cease funding grants to the Chicago Police Department that had been approved in the Obama administration because Chicago city officials were not cooperating with federal immigration officials.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ contended that Chicago officials were contributing to lawlessness by refusing to inform the feds of the whereabouts of undocumented foreign-born people, thereby creating what the feds derisively call a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d and Chicago officials have argued that their police officers and clerical folks are not obligated to work for the feds.\u000a\u000aWho is correct?\u000a\u000aThe concept of a sanctuary city does not mean it is a place where federal law is unenforced by the feds. Rather, it is a place where local authorities have elected not to spend their tax dollars helping the feds to enforce federal law. The term \u201csanctuary city\u201d is not a legal term but a political one. The Trump administration has used the term to characterize the governments of towns and cities that have created safe havens for those who have overstayed their visas by refusing to tell the feds who these folks are and where they can be found.\u000a\u000aCan local authorities refuse to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word, yes. There is no legal obligation on the part of local authorities to help the feds with manpower or resources or data to enforce federal law within the jurisdiction of those local authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring the Clinton administration, when Congress passed legislation that directed local law enforcement to enforce a federal gun registration scheme, the Supreme Court invalidated the statute. It ruled that the feds cannot commandeer local and state officials and compel them to enforce federal laws; the feds can enforce their own laws.

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages.

After examining data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and almost 50,000 public water systems across the nation, the EWG found 267 different contaminants in our nation's water supply\u2014more than half of which have no established legal limit.\u000a\u000aHow could this be, you ask? "The Environmental Protection Agency hasn't put a new contaminant on its regulated list since 1996, which is when the Clean Water Act was passed. We've learned so much more about chemicals since then, but we still haven't made any improvements in our policies," Leiba explains.\u000a\u000aArsenic, lead, the agricultural herbicide Atrazine, perchlorate, and perfluorinated chemicals are just a handful of the hundreds of contaminants the EWG found to be widespread in public tap water systems. Many of these chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic, impair thyroid function, and cause harm to fetal growth and development.\u000a\u000aI TRAVELED TO THE CARIBBEAN FOR IVF TREATMENTS -- HERE'S WHY\u000a\u000aWhen asked for a response, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spokesperson was quick to point out that "more than 90 percent of the country's drinking water systems meet all of EPA's health-based drinking water standards" and that the EPA has "set drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides."\u000a\u000aHow you can protect yourself\u000a\u000aStart by plugging your zip code into the EWG's database to learn what contaminants are in your local tap water.\u000a\u000aNext, check out the EWG water filter guide and buy one, stat. You can input contaminants of concern and find filters that are third-party certified by NSF International, a product testing, inspection, and certification organization.\u000a\u000a"In most cases, activated carbon water filters will reduce many or all contaminants," Leiba says, referring to the pitcher-style water filters many of us already use. "Having one is especially important if there's a vulnerable population in your house\u2014someone who is pregnant or sick, or a baby," Leiba says. (One EWG-approved filter to try: Brita Chrome 8-Cup Water Filter Pitcher, $40, amazon.com)\u000a\u000aPut your water filter to good use with this de-bloating sassy water recipe:\u000a\u000aOne thing you shouldn't do: turn to bottled water.\u000a\u000a"In many cases, bottled water is just filtered tap water, so it's the same thing you'd get using a filter," Leiba says. "But bottled water is much more expensive, and it can also expose you to contaminants leaching into your water from the plastic bottle itself."\u000a\u000aProtecting future generations\u000a\u000aLeiba says we all need to "raise our voices" and let elected officials know we need greater source-water protections and infrastructure upgrades (contact information for local government officials can be found on USA.gov.) "Our water utilities are constantly dealing with the influx of contaminants, but the onus isn't only on the utility," she says. "They're usually within federal safety limits, but being within federal limits does not mean our water is safe. In many cases, we've done the science and the testing, and we know that these contaminants are unsafe, but there's been no action taken."\u000a\u000aThis article first appeared on Prevention.

aVBy Matt Philbin, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aWell, this will cause a kerfuffle at Comic-Con. Or maybe not. Who the hell knows?\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a new Star Trek series in which it is forbidden for actors or writers to reference God (ironic, considering the only explanation for yet another Star Trek spinoff is punishment for man\u2019s innate sinfulness.)\u000a\u000aEntertainment Weekly relayed this anecdote from the set of CBS All Access\u2019s Star Trek: Discovery:\u000a\u000aThe imposing Captain Gabriel Lorca strides across the Starship Discovery bridge, squinting at the raging battle on the viewscreen, rattling off orders to his crew with rapid precision. There\u2019s a Federation ship under attack by Klingons, and the Discovery is rushing to join their fight. \u201cLock on the Bird of Prey!\u201d Lorca barks. \u201cBasic pattern Beta 9. Hard to port! Fire at something, for God\u2019s sakes!\u201d \u2026\u000a\u000aThe director halts the action and Lorca, played by British actor Jason Isaacs of Harry Potter fame, steps off the stage. The episode\u2019s writer, Kirsten Beyer, approaches to give a correction on his \u201cfor God\u2019s sakes\u201d ad lib.\u000a\u000a\u201cWait, I can\u2019t say \u2018God\u2019?\u201d Isaacs asks, amused. \u201cI thought I could say \u2018God\u2019 or \u2018damn\u2019 but not \u2018goddamn.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aBeyer explains that Star Trek is creator Gene Roddenberry\u2019s vision of a science-driven 23rd-century future where religion basically no longer exists.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow about \u2018for f\u2014\u2019s sake\u2019?\u201d he shoots back. \u201cCan I say that?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can say that before you can say \u2018God,\u2019 \u201d she dryly replies.\u000a\u000aSo yes, apparently Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was hostile to religion, and in his make-believe universe humans evolved past needing God.

aVA Virginia college student was sentenced this week to 100 days incarceration for submitting fraudulent voter registration forms listing the names of dead people and other faulty information for a political organization connected to the Democratic Party.\u000a\u000aAndrew J. Spieles, 21, was sentenced in federal court Tuesday for knowingly transferring false Virginia voter registration forms during the 2016 election, according to the Justice Department.\u000a\u000aSpieles, a student at James Madison University, worked as a staffer for Harrisonburg Votes -- a group affiliated with the Democratic Party -- and was paid to register voters in the area during the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. Spieles\u2019 job was to register as many voters as possible; he reported to Democratic campaign headquarters in Harrisonburg, Va., according to the DOJ.\u000a\u000aAfter filling out a registration form, Spieles entered the voter information into a computer system used by the Virginia Democratic Party. Each week, someone would hand-deliver paper copies to the Registrar\u2019s Office in Harrisonburg.\u000a\u000aLast August, however, an employee from the Registrar\u2019s Office contacted law enforcement after another worker recognized a registration form submitted in the name of the late father of a Virginia judge. The office then discovered multiple instances of falsified forms. Some were in the names of deceased individuals, and others had incorrect middle names, birth dates and Social Security numbers, according to the Justice Department.\u000a\u000aSpieles admitted he prepared all 18 of the false voter registration forms by obtaining information from \u201cwalk sheets\u201d given to him by the Virginia Democratic Party. Spieles said no one else participated in the crime.\u000a\u000aSpieles' fraud was punishable by up to a year in prison and a $100,00 fine, but he reached a plea agreement with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeb Terrien that limited his sentence to between 100 and 120 days behind bars, according to a EAGNews.org.

aVSo Google fired the employee who wrote an internal memo that went viral titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber: How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion.\u201d The fired Google engineer\u2019s name is James Damore. Ironically, he was let go for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes\u201d when he was actually protesting the thought control of political correctness.\u000a\u000aDamore\u2019s memo begins: \u201cI value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don\u2019t endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can't have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aJust after this he says, \u201cGoogle\u2019s political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety, but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety. This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead the memo and decide its merits for yourself. It is 10 pages long and I might argue with a few parts of it, but I wouldn\u2019t argue with its desperate attempt at honesty, a voice against a political wind of oppression.\u000a\u000aNow, the benefits of this federal database to policing might be profound. But it could also be used to record what political gatherings you attend, whether you attend AA meetings, or if you go to a gun show, and who was with you when you did.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s important now is to hear what Damore was trying to tell Google.\u000a\u000aLiberalism used to be anchored in the media centers of New York and Washington, D.C. Now it is increasingly centralized into the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area known as \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d This one tiny progressive enclave controls the huge social-media machines of Google, Facebook and more. They control the messaging for how the young, and even many of those who are older, get their news. Their political views\u2014and how they shun those who don\u2019t share them\u2014are pushed across these platforms.\u000a\u000aTo keep our freedom, we need to understand how this is affecting us and what we can do about it.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just thought control through one-sided, ideological messaging coming through this sector. Increasingly, our government is using that very same technology and information - to gather information about you.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s an example: Motorola now says they\u2019re working with Neurala, a startup that specializes in artificial intelligence software, to make cameras that \u201cautomatically search for persons or objects of interest.\u201d This means Motorola products, such as its Si500 body camera used by police departments, might use facial recognition to identify you.\u000a\u000aNow you might be thinking: So what, my mug shot has never been taken by the police so I'm not in their database? Sorry to tell you this, but there is a very good chance your photo is indeed in the FBI's system \u2013 the database police departments use.\u000a\u000aAs a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found, a majority of the photos in the FBI\u2019s Next Generation Identification System come from (at least) eighteen state driver\u2019s license bureaus and from those submitted for passports.\u000a\u000aThe FBI also just published a final rule in the Federal Register claiming the right not to tell you if your biometrics are in the Next Generation Identification System\u2014creating an exception to the Privacy Act.\u000a\u000aThe FBI began its advanced-biometric Next Generation Identification System in 2010 by adding facial recognition to a fingerprint database. The GAO reported that the FBI didn\u2019t inform us or publish a privacy impact assessment about this, even though they are required to do so by law.\u000a\u000aNow, the benefits of this database to policing might be profound, as this technology used on dash cams and body cameras could help the police find wanted criminals, missing persons or to identify people who have violent criminal records.\u000a\u000aBut it could also be used to record what political gatherings you attend, whether you attend AA meetings, or if you go to a gun show, and who was with you when you did.\u000a\u000aThink about that.\u000a\u000aI know, a lot of people might say it\u2019s only natural for U.S. intelligence agencies and police departments to want to use the latest technology. We\u2019re the good guys, the intel and police people think. Just trust us. Which is exactly what government cyber warriors have said to me as I researched and wrote my new novel, Kill Big Brother, a contemporary work of fiction that shows us where we are going and how to keep our freedom in this digital age.\u000a\u000aThe thing is, we need good police work, not massive oversight of all American citizens. And government is going straight to Silicon Valley to form alliances that give them massive amounts of data on us \u2013 massive amounts of data (information that should have Fourth Amendment protections, by the way) that overwhelms law enforcement without necessarily improving it.\u000a\u000aThe NSA, meanwhile, can\u2019t say \u2013 when asked by Congress \u2013 how many American citizens have been eavesdropped on by government (without warrants) via Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, legislation intelligence agencies want made permanent law before it expires in December.\u000a\u000aSo what we have is an often one-sided, political ideology being pushed by Silicon Valley via social media and a government that is increasingly using the technology and data from these companies to collect information on you.\u000a\u000aThis is either a recipe for a Big Brother-style dystopia or for a smarter more technological system. If we prefer to create the latter \u2013 which we should \u2013 we need to demand freedom of expression from tech firms (as James Damore tried to do) and to push Congress to update laws to restrict government where necessary from taking away our freedom.\u000a\u000aWithout a doubt, the FBI and NSA and other government entities need to remain strong. But they need to do so without reducing our freedom in order to empower themselves.\u000a\u000aFrank Miniter is author of "The Future of the Gun" & "The Ultimate Man\u2019s Survival Guide". His latest book is, is "Kill Big Brother", a cyber-thriller that shows how to balance freedom with security without diminishing the U.S. Bill of Rights.

aVBy Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, the Trump Department of Justice told the mayor of Chicago that it would cease funding grants to the Chicago Police Department that had been approved in the Obama administration because Chicago city officials were not cooperating with federal immigration officials.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ contended that Chicago officials were contributing to lawlessness by refusing to inform the feds of the whereabouts of undocumented foreign-born people, thereby creating what the feds derisively call a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d and Chicago officials have argued that their police officers and clerical folks are not obligated to work for the feds.\u000a\u000aWho is correct?\u000a\u000aThe concept of a sanctuary city does not mean it is a place where federal law is unenforced by the feds. Rather, it is a place where local authorities have elected not to spend their tax dollars helping the feds to enforce federal law. The term \u201csanctuary city\u201d is not a legal term but a political one. The Trump administration has used the term to characterize the governments of towns and cities that have created safe havens for those who have overstayed their visas by refusing to tell the feds who these folks are and where they can be found.\u000a\u000aCan local authorities refuse to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word, yes. There is no legal obligation on the part of local authorities to help the feds with manpower or resources or data to enforce federal law within the jurisdiction of those local authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring the Clinton administration, when Congress passed legislation that directed local law enforcement to enforce a federal gun registration scheme, the Supreme Court invalidated the statute. It ruled that the feds cannot commandeer local and state officials and compel them to enforce federal laws; the feds can enforce their own laws.

Yayla, an adjunct professor at George Mason University in Virginia, says the bomb materials used in the aborted attack likely arrived in Australia via air cargo \u2013 probably aboard a passenger jet -- evading all security measures.\u000a\u000aAlthough the Australian operation ultimately failed, it was the type of plot that Western nations can expect to see more often, says Yayla, who from 2010 to 2013 led the counterterrorism and operations department of the Turkish National Police in Sanliurfa.

"It is the job of [Defense] Secretary [Jim] Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally ... That is his mandate."\u000a\u000aGorka sought to clarify his remarks Thursday afternoon in an interview on Fox News' "Your World with Neil Cavuto."\u000a\u000a"I was admonishing the journalists of the fake news industrial complex who are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they are demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state," Gorka told host Liz Claman.

aVBy Judge Andrew P.

Rather, it is a place where local authorities have elected not to spend their tax dollars helping the feds to enforce federal law. The term \u201csanctuary city\u201d is not a legal term but a political one. The Trump administration has used the term to characterize the governments of towns and cities that have created safe havens for those who have overstayed their visas by refusing to tell the feds who these folks are and where they can be found.\u000a\u000aCan local authorities refuse to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word, yes. There is no legal obligation on the part of local authorities to help the feds with manpower or resources or data to enforce federal law within the jurisdiction of those local authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring the Clinton administration, when Congress passed legislation that directed local law enforcement to enforce a federal gun registration scheme, the Supreme Court invalidated the statute. It ruled that the feds cannot commandeer local and state officials and compel them to enforce federal laws; the feds can enforce their own laws.

aVFact: The United States and its allies in the Asia-Pacific would demolish North Korea in any conceivable military scenario. Even if our worst fears are realized, and Kim Jong Un decided to lash out with nuclear weapons, Washington would ensure Pyongyang was turned into atomic ash\u2014what would clearly be the end of the so-called \u201chermit kingdom\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut what is lost in our recent conversations of war and peace in Asia today are two key questions: Just how bad would such a conflict be and what happens when the war is over?\u000a\u000aStop and think about it for a second. If we accept the fact that a war fought on the Korean peninsula -- if waged with no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, which is by no means a certainty\u2014it stands to reason that the number of conventional weapons used by North and South Korea, America and likely Japan or others would flatten large sections of the Korea peninsula. To make matters worse, such carnage would likely spread to the Japanese home islands, U.S. military bases around the region or even Guam, Hawaii or Alaska.\u000a\u000aTo focus our minds around this terrifying problem, let us consider for a moment just one of the many very real scenarios that could occur in what would be a Second Korean War. If, for example, North Korea were to launch a salvo of artillery shells into Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital\u2014just a mere 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates north and south\u2014the devastation could be catastrophic. Imagine countless skyscrapers and tall buildings collapsing to the earth, millions of people fleeing to mass transit and clogging all exits out of one of the world\u2019s largest cities. It would be, in many respects, 9/11\u2014but times a hundred. The rebuilding of downtown Seoul would be in the billions of dollars, not to mention the rebuilding of countless people\u2019s lives. Just that one act alone, in what could be the opening chapter of a war the brutality of which we have not seen in generations\u2014not to mention would be magnified on social media many times over\u2014would horrify us all for generations to come.\u000a\u000aAnd the above is just a small example of what could happen. If we expand this out a little more, what if North Korea\u2014in a future scenario where President Trump begins a massive buildup like the First or Second Gulf Wars\u2014decides to strike first and launch not only attacks on Seoul, but deploy the full weight of his conventional military forces in an all-out assault against the South? While there are countless examples of how this could be operationalized, three come to mind\u2014all equally terrifying.\u000a\u000aFirst, Kim could launch the full weight of his 1.1-million-man army, 4,300 tanks and countless artillery and rocket batteries to attack the South. While his forces are old (much of it armed with 1950s technology), the sheer amount of these weapons ensures they would do incredible damage. And yes, Washington and Seoul would be able to destroy the clear majority of Kim\u2019s army quickly, but the devastation left in its wake could be catastrophic.\u000a\u000aNext, Kim could just decide to fire off his over 1,000 missiles in wave after wave of terror strikes on Seoul, Tokyo and U.S. military bases around the region. Such attacks, especially if carried out against major cities in South Korea or Japan, would drive mass panic throughout each nation. While it stands to reason North Korea\u2019s missiles aren\u2019t as accurate as America's or other major powers like Russia or China, they could be used as the ultimate terror weapon\u2014doing perhaps more damage to people\u2019s psyche, tearing away at any notion that Pyongyang could not reach out and strike them at a moment\u2019s notice.\u000a\u000aThird, North Korea could decide to deploy its massive force of 200,000 special forces in a clandestine assault on the South. We know Pyongyang has dug countless tunnels under the DMZ into South Korea\u2014some that have been discovered are now even tourist attractions. Even if they sent a small force of several thousand troops to the South, the Seoul government would have to launch a massive manhunt to catch these forces, who could spread terror and mayhem throughout the country.\u000a\u000aAs if all of this isn\u2019t bad enough\u2014and keep in mind these are the simplest of examples, such a war would have many layers of horror\u2014there is what happens after, and that might be the most troubling prospect of all.\u000a\u000aRemember, if North Korea is defeated without becoming an atomic graveyard, North and South Korea would need to be reunited. Think the scale of the Syrian Civil War seems incalculable or rebuilding Iraq or Afghanistan is challenging? A destroyed North Korea with massive damage done to the South could make any of those pale in comparison.\u000a\u000aTake for example the most immediate challenges that would have to be solved quickly. Who would oversee what is left of North Korea and actually run the country? Do you allow some members of the North Korea government, who know the country best, to stay on in some fashion? What do you do with what remains of Kim\u2019s military? And for that matter, what do you do with Kim if he lives?\u000a\u000aThen, how do you feed a starving North Korean population of 25 million people? How can you logistically bring enough resources in to feed the hungry when there are no roads, bridges or transportation network to do it?\u000a\u000aNot only would you have both sides needing trillions of dollars in reconstruction aid but you would need to somehow figure out how to rebuild a North Korean society that has been brainwashed by decades of rule by the Kim family.\u000a\u000aWe must also consider what the outside world will think of Korean unification, and that means China. What will Beijing do, seeing a united Korea that would likely be a strong U.S. ally and potentially still hosting U.S. troops in the years to come? While far into the future, a strong, united Korea could be a powerful counterweight to China, and along with Japan, a powerful U.S. friend. How would Beijing react?\u000a\u000aAnd what about Kim\u2019s network of concentration camps. Who is to be blamed, shamed and charged with crimes against humanity? How can you help perhaps as many as 200,000 people who have had their lives destroyed in a fashion not seen since the days of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler?\u000a\u000aIn all fairness, the scenarios I have laid out only scratch at the surface of what a war on the Korean peninsula would look like. If such a war were to involve nuclear, chemical or other weapons of mass destruction, the devastation would be beyond our imagination.\u000a\u000aTherefore, all sides, especially the brutal regime of Kim Jong Un, should think twice about proceeding down the path towards conflict. Because in a Second Korean War, no one wins.\u000a\u000aHarry J.

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVA watchdog group is urging the Federal Election Commission to investigate the Democratic National Committee and a former consultant for allegedly soliciting illegal contributions from the Ukrainian government by seeking information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\u000a\u000aThe Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a complaint with the FEC on Wednesday, accusing the DNC and former Ukrainian-American consultant Alexandra Chalupa of breaking federal law.\u000a\u000aChalupa was brought into the broader debate regarding Russia's 2016 election meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign when Politico published a report months ago revealing she met with officials in the Ukrainian Embassy last year.\u000a\u000aAccording to FACT\u2019s complaint, a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy was instructed to help Chalupa conduct opposition research on Trump\u2019s campaign -- specifically, to help expose ties between Manafort and Russia.\u000a\u000aThe Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\u000a\u000aFACT alleged that Chalupa received improper \u201cin-kind contributions\u201d -- which they define as \u201canything of value, including information and leads, the fruits of paid research, or similar investigatory activity to a political committee\u201d -- regarding Manafort while employed by the DNC.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince Chalupa was being paid by the DNC at the time of the collusion, this constitutes an illegal, in-kind contribution,\u201d FACT said in a statement, noting federal law "prohibits accepting or receiving anything of value from foreign nationals."\u000a\u000aFEC guidelines are broad regarding what can be considered an in-kind contribution but list advertising, print and consultant services, and more.\u000a\u000aThe FACT complaint also notes that the \u201cDNC subsequently acknowledged that they had knowledge of the research\u201d obtained by Chalupa on behalf of Ukrainian officials.\u000a\u000a"We can tell that at, one point, someone from the DNC acknowledged the information, though they denied using it," FACT's general counsel, Kendra Arnold, told Fox News.

aVSTAUNTON, Ill. \u2013 Important automotive history went up in smoke Tuesday night in southeast Illinois as a five-alarm fire destroyed many vehicles at Country Classic Cars in Staunton.\u000a\u000aThe fire began around 8 p.m. Approximately 100 firefighters from 13 different departments did everything they could to save the business. Five buildings, one of which housed about 150 vehicles, were a total loss.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t make them like this anymore,\u201d said Russ Noel, owner of Country Classic Cars. \u201cA lot of those cars in there, I\u2019ll never replace them probably.\u201d\u000a\u000aFlames lit up the night sky; the blaze could be seen from miles away. Witnesses said smoke was so thick they had to close nearby roads. About five percent of the cars were owned by folks who put their vehicle under consignment.\u000a\u000aThe business kept about 600 cars dating from the 1920s to the 1980s on the property. About a quarter of those cars burned.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to see history like this burned to the ground,\u201d said Keith Buschmann, a car buff.\u000a\u000aCountry Classic Cars had been celebrating its 20th anniversary.

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data. If the sensor detects dangerous levels of radon for longer than 48 hours, it notifies the user and recommends what to do next. The sensor also gives audio alerts.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aIf high levels of radon are detected, experts recommend getting in touch immediately with a contractor who can implement a radon reduction system that will reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. It will set you back around $800-$1,200 \u2014 or more if the home has crawl spaces, no gravel under the slab or a completely finished lower level.\u000a\u000a\u201cEach state radon or radiation department should have a list of qualified contractors,\u201d Brodhead said. \u201cIt is usually best to have a local qualified contractor do the work to get better service.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrodhead recommends hiring a contractor who visits your home before submitting an estimate. He also advises getting more than one estimate and checking with references.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVMicrosoft's Surface family suffered a major blow Thursday, August 10, as Consumer Reports not only pulled its recommendation forallSurface-branded products, but moved them into the dreaded "not recommended" category. The consumer watchdog publication cited concerns over longevity and a remarkably high failure rate in its statement summarizing its decision.\u000a\u000a"New studies conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center estimate that 25 percent of Microsoft laptops and tablets will present their owners with problems by the end of the second year of ownership," Consumer Reports said.\u000a\u000aTo clarify, it's not just the new Surface Laptop that has drawn criticism from Consumer Reports, but the entire lineup -- the Surface, the Surface Pro, Surface Book,and the new Surface Laptop. These products are now "not recommended" by the consumer watchdog publication, but a few products in particular received even more devastating news, in that their previous recommendations are being reversed.\u000a\u000aBoth the Surface Laptop, 128GB and 256GB versions, and the Surface Book, 128 and 512GB versions, are losing their previous recommendations on account of their unusually high failure rates.\u000a\u000aMicrosoft defended its products, stating that the Surface lineup is more reliable than Consumer Reports claims.\u000a\u000a"Microsoft's real-world return and support rates for past models differ significantly from Consumer Reports' breakage predictability," Microsoft told Consumer Reports. "We don't believe these findings accurately reflect Surface owners' true experiences or capture the performance and reliability improvements made with every Surface generation."\u000a\u000aMicrosoft's statement very carefully maneuvers around the Consumer Reports data, stating that the Surface improves with each generation, and that should be taken into account when considering failure rates.\u000a\u000aEven if true, that avoids the question of currentreliability. Stating that a product's failure rate goes down with each successive generation doesn't exactly speak to the core issue -- that Surface products reportedly have a reputation for failing the people who buy them. The fact that they might fail less than they used to isn't going to matter to someone who just shelled out upwards of $1,000 on a product that might only last around two years.\u000a\u000aOne reason for the reportedly high failure rates could be that Microsoft is relatively new to PC manufacturing.\u000a\u000aThe reality is that Microsoft has very little experience in some of the newer categories its entering very rapidly, which may expose it to more risk of problems in manufacturing, a chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, Jan Dawson, told Reuters.\u000a\u000aThe problem here is that Consumer Reports and Microsoft each have their own data supporting their respective conclusions. Of course, only one of these two companies actually has a vested interest in people believing the Surface products are reliable. The other just wants to make sure you're able to make an informed decision about which products you buy.

aVPresident Trump announced Thursday he is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national emergency.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe opioid crisis is an emergency, and I'm saying officially right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump, speaking after a security briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., said his administration is preparing the paperwork for the declaration. Doing so was the most urgent recommendation in a letter sent last week to the president by his own opioid commission.\u000a\u000aNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who leads the commission, thanked the president for his announcement Thursday.\u000a\u000aHERE'S WHAT A NATIONAL OPIOID EMERGENCY MEANS\u000a\u000a"I am completely confident that the President will address this problem aggressively and do all he can to alleviate the suffering and loss of scores of families in every corner of our country," Christie said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis claimed that executive action would make the epidemic a top priority and allow the Cabinet to take \u201cbold steps\u201d toward combating drug abuse. Such a step could enhance the administration\u2019s ability to make grants and conduct investigations.\u000a\u000a"If this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will," the letter said.\u000a\u000aAmericans consume more opioids than residents of any other country, the commission said.\u000a\u000aCiting a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration report that said four out of every five new heroin users began with prescription opioid abuse, the commission described the nation\u2019s health care system as the root of the crisis.\u000a\u000aThe recommendations presented to the president included improved prescription tracking; increased treatment and education on substance use; and a call to ensure law enforcement always carry the counter-overdose drug naloxone.\u000a\u000aGiven the recent spike in overdoses, a study released last week by STAT warned that opioids could kill nearly 500,000 Americans in the next decade if this issue is neglected. But according to Richard Baum, acting White House drug czar, the White House already is pursuing some of the recommendations to protect against abuse.\u000a\u000a"Addressing the opioid epidemic is a top priority for the President and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy,\u201d Baum said in a statement. \u201cThe good news is that the Administration is already working on several of these recommendations, including improving our abilities to detect fentanyl, increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, and looking at ways to improve prescriber education. The President and I both appreciate the Commission's hard work on this interim report and are eagerly awaiting the final report."\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration is also taking action on other fronts.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week the formation of the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit. The pilot program will be implemented in 12 districts across the nation to focus on preventing opioid-related health care fraud and pill mill schemes.

aVBy The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d Tuesday if it continues to menace the U.S. with nuclear weapons, he provoked almost as much backlash at home as in Pyongyang. The usual diplomatic suspects, including some American lawmakers, claimed his remarks hurt U.S. credibility and were irresponsible.\u000a\u000aThe President\u2019s point was that the North\u2019s escalating threats are intolerable; he didn\u2019t set any red lines. True to form, Pyongyang responded by putting the U.S. island of Guam in its cross hairs. Mr. Trump may be guilty of hyperbole (quelle surprise), but that is far less damaging to U.S. credibility than Barack Obama\u2019s failure to enforce his prohibition on the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons in Syria. The foreign-policy elite who claim to be shocked also don\u2019t have much credibility after their policy across three Administrations led to the current North Korean danger.\u000a\u000aWhile the President\u2019s words were unusually colorful, the Communist-style language may have been part of the message: Kim Jong Un isn\u2019t the only one who can raise the geopolitical temperature. The U.S. has military options to neutralize the regime\u2019s nuclear threat if it continues to develop long-range missiles, and the U.S. is considering those options.

aVBy Jay Maxon, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aStill unsigned football free agent, Colin Kaepernick has a new apologist -- a law professor and Islamaphobia researcher. One of the most outlandish and indefensible attacks on the NFL comes in an error-filled diatribe by Khaled Beydoun, a law professor at the Universit of Detroit Mercy and also a senior affiliated faculty with the University of California-Berkeley Islmaophobia Research and Documentation Project.\u000a\u000aFor a law professor, Beydoun displays serious problems with legal terms and accuracy, all demonstrated in his hit piece carried on the America-hating Al Jazeera website.\u000a\u000aThe professor repeatedly states that Kaepernick has been blackballed by the NFL. It was, he claims, punishment for his "condemnation of white supremacy." The word "blackball" is defined as "to vote against, especially to veto the admission of," and "to shut out from social or commercial participation; ostracize or boycott." There is no boycott of Kaepernick, and there is no organized league effort to silence him or keep him out of the league.

aVPresident Trump on Thursday doubled down on his \u201cfire and fury\u201d warning to North Korea, suggesting any attack on Guam -- as threatened by Pyongyang -- would result in an unprecedented response from the U.S.\u000a\u000a"Let\u2019s see what [Kim Jong Un] does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before \u2013 what will happen in North Korea," Trump said.\u000a\u000aAt a separate appearance, Trump also pushed back against critics who suggested his comments earlier in the week were too forceful. Trump told reporters: \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough."\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years,\u201d the president said of North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump made the comments at his New Jersey golf club, where he had a security briefing with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\u000a\u000aAsked by a reporter what\u2019s tougher than threatening "fire and fury," Trump said: \u201cYou\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attacking anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us, they can be very, very nervous,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump wouldn\u2019t say if he\u2019s considering a preemptive strike on North Korea. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI never do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat they\u2019ve been doing, what they\u2019ve been getting away with, is a tragedy and it can\u2019t be allowed,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTensions have escalated with North Korea over the last several days. On Tuesday, Trump reacted to reports that North Korea had produced a compact nuclear warhead by warning the country that it would face consequences if it threatened the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aThe comment was questioned by some Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain.\u000a\u000a"I don't know what he's saying and I've long ago given up trying to interpret what he says,\u201d McCain told KTAR radio. "It's not terrible but it's kind of the classic Trump in that he overstates things."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, congressional Democrats slammed Trump, calling his threat reckless.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s \u2018fire and fury\u2019 ad lib was not helpful,\u201d said Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cDefusing the North Korea threat will take smart, steady leadership and stronger diplomatic ties with our key allies.\u201d\u000a\u000aHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the comments \u201crecklessly belligerent.\u201d\u000a\u000aHours after Trump\u2019s original warning, state media in North Korea reported that its leaders were seriously considering a plan to fire missiles at Guam. Pyongyang called Trump's threat a "load of nonsense."\u000a\u000aBut the White House has tried to present a unified front.\u000a\u000aWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that Kelly and members of the National Security Council were \u201caware of the tone of the statement of the president prior to delivery.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a threat to North Korea in a fiery statement of his own, warning the country not to "initiate" a conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe DPRK regime's actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates,\u201d the defense secretary said.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTuesday is the day\u2014thanks to a devastating report in The Washington Post saying North Korea has \u201csuccessfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles\u201d--that will go down in history. We can no longer deny North Korea has become a full-fledged nuclear power.\u000a\u000aTyping those words makes my hands shake. But it also makes me angry\u2014very angry.\u000a\u000aWe can\u2019t pretend we did not see this coming. I remember being an undergraduate in college in the late 1990s and reading about how North Korea could someday develop such weapons. It seemed so far off, as if that day would never come, but here we are.\u000a\u000aIn all honesty, how are we shocked? This technology is old stuff\u2014dangerous, but old.\u000a\u000aAnyone who took a 5th grade history class knows that the first nuclear weapons were detonated in 1945 and used that same year to end the Second World War\u2014twice.\u000a\u000aThe first ICBM launch by the United States was in 1957. This technology is from many years past, and even states like North Korea\u2014despite its people starving and having an economy smaller than Ethiopia\u2014have the capability to copy what was done many decades ago.\u000a\u000aThey say failure has a thousand fathers, so when it comes to North Korea\u2019s nuclear achievements we can only blame administration after administration\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014who decided the North Korean threat was never big enough, or too far away to demand that much of our attention or worry.\u000a\u000aWe are paying for that attitude today. And future generations will as well.

aVWe've heard of skunky beer, but never gecko-y beer. The latter seems to be much worse than the former, based on a lawsuit filed in California against Heineken and the Kroger grocery chain.\u000a\u000aConsumerist reports on the complaint, which came about after Orange County's George Toubbeh said he bought 24-ounce cans of Heineken in August 2015 from a Kroger-owned Ralph's in Fountain Valley, and had a decidedly unpleasant experience after drinking from one.\u000a\u000aPer the suit, Toubbeh picked up on a "foul taste" in his brew; soon after sipping it, he fell victim to "severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting." He says when his daughter went to examine the can, she made an alarming discovery inside: two un-decomposed juvenile leopard geckos, which aren't native to the U.S. \u2014 they're indigenous to parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Iran and Iraq \u2014 but can be kept as pets here.\u000a\u000aToubbeh notes in the suit that he became "violently ill" and went to the ER, where he was given anxiety and nausea medication. Business Insider also notes that he claimed to have developed "extreme anxiety and \u2026 PTSD," which he says continue to this day, as a result of his allegedly lizard-steeped libation.\u000a\u000aToubbeh thinks the geckos were probably alive and sealed in the can at the packaging plant. Heineken, for its part, is calling this incident "isolated" and says "based on a number of factors we confidently believe there is no merit to this claim."\u000a\u000aIf you've got a strong stomach, Consumerist documents other instances of surprise "ingredients" in food and beverage items.\u000a\u000aThis article originally appeared on Newser: "Beer Drinker's Suit: 2 Geckos in My Heineken Gave Me PTSD."\u000a\u000aMore From Newser

Trump does deserve some credit for the soaring stock market.\u000a\u000aAs of Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had scored record highs for nine days in a row; the gains are driving anti-Trumpers crazy. Though the president\u2019s boasts are not always accurate, lapses the New York Times eagerly documents, his recent tweet celebrating the Dow passing 22,000 for the first time is on the mark.\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels.

That doesn\u2019t mean the liberal media will stand down from their incessant anti-Trump alarmism and admit that his pro-business policies might be boosting economic growth or doing the country some good.\u000a\u000aHence, recent pieces have dredged up other reasons for the gains in stocks, many of which are valid. Earnings gains have indeed been above expectations; there is vast monetary stimulus around the world, we see renewed growth in China and Europe and a weakening dollar; all those elements and more have played a role.\u000a\u000aBut, they are not the entire story.

aVThe Dodge Viper will end production this month after a 25-year run. A little sad, right? Before you start the water works, remember that the Chevy Camaro went out of production in 2002 with no plans for revival, yet Chevy brought the pony car back in 2010. The same could happen to the Viper.\u000a\u000aWe recently had a chance to be a fly on the wall as the people responsible for the V-10 sports car looked back on the Viper\u2019s history. Their war stories gave us new respect for the blood, sweat, and tears that went into keeping the project alive. Here\u2019s a sample of the more interesting facts we learned:\u000a\u000aThe Viper team was modeled after Lockheed Martin\u2019s Skunk Works.\u000a\u000aIn 1990, when the original group of 75 convened to design and engineer the Viper, all involved were given a copy of the book Skunk Works, by Ben Rich. That book told the story of the Lockheed special division that designed and built a series of innovative planes, including the U-2, SR-71, and stealth bomber. Viper lead engineer Roy Sjoberg hoped the book would inspire his engineers to create a small, highly functional, and creative team. The book, by the way, is a fantastic read.\u000a\u000aDodge considered an optional automatic transmission.\u000a\u000aA slushbox sounds heretical to the Viper\u2019s original pure-roadster mission, but it was seriously considered for the final version of the car. Ralph Gillies, who took over the Viper program in 2011, wanted to offer an automatic. During early stages of the car\u2019s development, sections of the frame were changed to high-strength steel to increase the stiffness. Eventually it got to a point where most of the chassis was made from the material. Gilles said if they had known from the beginning that they would end up there, they would have adapted the frame to fit an automatic. \u201cWe would have kept the manual, of course,\u201d Gillies said, \u201cbut I would have loved to offer the option of paddle shifters.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aAluminum and carbon fiber were in the works nearly two decades ago, but then...\u000a\u000aIn 1998, when John Fernandez was Viper chief, plans were made for the car to carry an aluminum frame and carbon-fiber body panels. \u201cI got the idea from Lotus,\u201d Fernandez said \u201cSome their early cars had an aluminum spine. We would have saved 200 pounds.\u201d But alas, the frame supplier backed out, and the carbon-fiber proved too expensive. Both technologies, however, eventually emerged in other sports cars. The 2006 Corvette Z06 had an aluminum frame, and the last Vipers use carbon-fiber body panels.\u000a\u000aBob Lutz said \u201cno\u201d to a Hemi V-8.\u000a\u000aBack in the gestation days, around 1989, Sjoberg knew that somewhere in Chrysler\u2019s R&D office lived an all-aluminum version of the V-8 Hemi that was based on the engines that dominated racing in the \u201960s and \u201970s. Sjoberg planned to stick one on an engine dyno until Bob Lutz (then head of global product development) heard about it and immediately nixed the idea. One of the Viper\u2019s main calling cards, of course, was its unique V-10 engine.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aIt took only a half hour for Lee Iacocca to approve the project.\u000a\u000aThe final approval from Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca came in 1990. Sjoberg and Lutz took Iacocca for a spin in a prototype on Oakland Avenue in Detroit. After a 30-minute drive, The King of the K Car emerged impressed. He looked at Lutz and said, \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d\u000a\u000aA homeless shelter served as a port in the storm.\u000a\u000aDuring a development drive from Key West, Fla., to Los Angeles, Gillies and engine chief Dick Winkles were caught in a freak snowstorm that forced them to stop in El Paso, Texas. All the hotels were booked, so they spent the night in the local homeless shelter, sleeping in a large room packed with beds and locals.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026. [to] what's right for you," such as narrow or wide, Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aParents can turn off the camera if they choose to monitor only the sound. Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted. Parents can dress up Arlo Baby to look like a rabbit (with snap-on ears and feet) , a Dalmatian, or a cat.\u000a\u000aIt also records video, so busy parents don't have to miss milestones like their baby\u2019s first words or first steps.\u000a\u000a"If one parent is on the road, you can use your smartphone and get access to a live feed from the camera, and type in your password to get into the app and see what baby's doing at any time of the day," Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aUsers can talk to their babies when they\u2019re away, thanks to the monitor\u2019s two-way audio. Speak into your smartphone, and your baby will hear your voice on the monitor\u2019s speaker.\u000a\u000aThe camera can also be used to record or live-stream nannies and babysitters.\u000a\u000a"The most important thing you can protect is your family,\u201d Falgiano said, \u201cso being able to have tools to help monitor the child\u2026 and have it all tied in to [a smartphone experience] you're already using\u2026 we thought it made sense to bring that experience all together."

aVBy Fred Fleitz, Fox News\u000a\u000aTuesday's bombshell Washington Post story that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has determined North Korea is capable of constructing miniaturized nuclear weapons that could be used as warheads for missiles \u2013 possibly ICBMs \u2013 left out a crucial fact: DIA actually concluded this in 2013. The Post also failed to mention that the Obama administration tried to downplay and discredit this report at the time.\u000a\u000aDuring an April 11, 2013, House Armed Services Committee hearing, Congressman Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., inadvertently revealed several unclassified sentences from a DIA report that said DIA had determined with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that North Korea has the capability to make a nuclear weapon small enough to be launched with a ballistic missile.\u000a\u000aThe Director of National Intelligence and Obama officials subsequently tried to dismiss Lamborn\u2019s disclosure by claiming the DIA assessment was an outlier that did not reflect the views of the rest of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\u000a\u000aIt was clear what Obama officials were doing in 2013. The DIA report represented inconvenient facts that threatened President Obama\u2019s North Korea \u201cstrategic patience\u201d policy -- a policy to do nothing about North Korea and kick this problem down the road to the next president. Obama officials tried to downplay the DIA assessment to prevent it from being used to force the president to employ a more assertive North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worth noting that the Trump White House has not condemned the Washington Post story as a leak. That\u2019s probably because it was an authorized disclosure of classified information to advance President Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy. That is, instead of concealing intelligence to avoid taking action against the tough North Korea problem like the Obama administration did, the Trump administration publicized this same intelligence to demonstrate the seriousness of this threat and why decisive action by the United States is required.

President Obama called us bitter. Hillary Clinton called us irredeemable. The mainstream media called us backwater bigots. We were mocked by Hollywood and dismissed by academics. We were marginalized by the media - bullied and belittled by sex and gender revolutionaries. With the election of Donald Trump, the American people have spoken.

aVA day after FOX 4 News got involved in a dispute over soiled luggage, the Garland couple that was left holding the stinky bags says they've reached a resolution with Southwest Airlines.\u000a\u000aThe Cains say a baby carrier and three of their suitcases were transported in the belly of a plane arrived wet and with a foul smell.\u000a\u000aSouthwest initially said it was not liable for the damage due in part to how late the claim was filed.\u000a\u000aErica Cain didn't go into details but says she talked to a Southwest Airlines representative Tuesday afternoon. Cain says she was assured the leak was not raw sewage and has agreed to a cash payout by the airline.\u000a\u000aThe positive outcome is a stark contrast to Monday when the couple was told by the airline it was not liable for the damage because, according to the Cains, they did not file a claim within the required four hour window period.\u000a\u000aSouthwest Airlines says the policy allows them to "better validate that the mishandling or damage was caused by the carrier" and added that the longer the time period, the harder it is to substantiate that the damage occurred while the bag was in the airline's possession.\u000a\u000aThe Cains, who were traveling for the first time with their 5-month-old baby, said Monday the window period isn't practical.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe noticed that it has this foul smell to it, and immediately I thought to throw it into the laundry and see if we can do it ourselves. By this time, it's been four hours after our flight,\u201d Erica said. \u201cThe four-hour time frame is just unrealistic for anyone who is traveling anywhere.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs farecompare.com points out, Southwest is not the only airline with a four-hour reporting window. Spirit and JetBlue have a similar policy. Larger carriers, like American Airlines, give passengers 24 hours to report a baggage claim.\u000a\u000aThe problem is finding that important information can be tedious. Often times, it's buried inside a large document called "contract of carriage."\u000a\u000aMore from FOX 4 News

It is the closest the world has come to a possible nuclear exchange since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. That crisis, you will remember, ended only after President Kennedy imposed a naval blockade (an act of war in international law) and threatened further escalation. That threat, credible as it was, led to a diplomatic solution.

Walker Wildmon, assistant to the President of the American Family Association, joined the Todd Starnes Show today to discuss his latest piece "What Keeps the Swamp the Swamp" in which he says, "The problem with the Republican Party is not its platform or its principles.

aVIf it weren\u2019t for his daughter, Ronald Ro, a San Francisco-based engineer, might still be working for Boeing or Samsung. And if it weren\u2019t for her dad, 6-year-old Jungsuh might still be struggling with her eczema.\u000a\u000aSeven years ago, Ro and his friend Kevin Cho, who has two sons with asthma, were frustrated with the air monitors on the market and set out to design a better one. In 2015 they launched Awair.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, the $199 Awair, with its minimalistic display and North American walnut case, looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired alarm clock. It gives you the time, but when you double-tap on the monitor, it displays the air quality scores in the room. There\u2019s also the $179 Awair Baby, designed for nurseries in Ocean blue or Baby Rose. The final product in the line, Awair Glow ($109), plugs directly into an outlet and could easily be mistaken for a nightlight made by Apple.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000a\u201cJust because there is technology within our products doesn\u2019t mean they need to look like technology,\u201d says Ro, who became Awair\u2019s CEO.\u000a\u000aBut what really distinguishes Awair from other air monitors is its empowerment capabilities.\u000a\u000aAccording to the American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air 2017 report, more than 40 percent of Americans \u2014 more than 125 million people \u2014 live in counties that have unhealthful levels of ozone or particle pollution. Dirty air exacerbated Ro\u2019s daughter\u2019s eczema and Cho\u2019s sons\u2019 asthma; it\u2019s the archenemy of people with allergies and chemical sensitivities; and it\u2019s been linked to sleeping problems and even death. According to 2014 World Health Organization estimates, polluted air is the cause of one out of every eight deaths in the world.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aIndoor air can be five times as polluted as outdoor air, according to Awair, and people \u2014 whether they\u2019re in a hotel room that\u2019s been cleaned with harsh chemicals \u2026 or in a packed and poorly ventilated meeting room with rising levels of carbon dioxide \u2026 or in an older home with low-quality paint and carpeting that leaks chemicals into the air \u2014 often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re inhaling toxins.\u000a\u000aAwair monitors the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, chemicals and dust in a room, and when any of them reach unhealthy levels \u2014 indicated by a color code on the display \u2014 it notifies an app that recommends solutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe always jokingly say in the office, \u2018The only people who need Awair are those who breathe air,\u2019\u201d says Ro. \u201cMany people don\u2019t think about air because they don\u2019t see it, but the fact is that we wouldn\u2019t drink dirty water, but so many of us breathe dirty air.\u201d\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aThe Awair app also provides tips and recommended courses of action from the Mayo Clinic. For example, it may suggest placing a peace lily, which removes airborne chemicals, in a bathroom with a high chemical score. Or it may recommend using 100 percent soy and beeswax candles, since conventional candles omit high levels of volatile organic compounds. It\u2019s also programmed to remind users to keep up on housekeeping, from laundering linens to wiping away dust.\u000a\u000aPeople who own the Awair Glow can even turn on heaters, air conditioners and humidifiers remotely when the app detects unhealthy air. \u201cWe\u2019ve received emails from users raving about how they connect their irons to it because they always forget to turn it off,\u201d says Ro. \u201cWe\u2019ve even heard about some people connecting their crock pots, which we can\u2019t promote, but we admire the creativity.\u201d\u000a\u000aAwair can connect over Wi-Fi to Alexa, Google Home, Nest and the IFTTT web service to automate the process of purifying your air, and it keeps a log of recordings so you can track air quality over time.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aRo says his team is still working on improving the user experience, adding that his team values feedback and is continually updating the tips to make sure users are comfortable with them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have accomplished much since we launched Awair in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking at the roadmap, one thing is clear: This is just the beginning.\u201d\u000a\u000aKatie Jackson is a travel writer.

aVPresident Trump turned up the heat even more on North Korea late Thursday, warning the regime of real consequences if it carries out an attack on Guam.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s see what he does with Guam,\u201d Trump said of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cHe does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before \u2013 what will happen in North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a dare, it\u2019s a statement,\u201d Trump said of his vow to respond to any attack against Guam, a U.S. island territory.\u000a\u000aTrump made the comments during a wide-ranging question and answer session with reporters at his Bedminster National Golf Club. He was seated at a table with Vice President Pence, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has disrespected our country greatly,\u201d Trump said of North Korea\u2019s leader. \u201cHe has said things that are horrific. And with me, he\u2019s not getting away with it. He got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. He\u2019s not getting away with it. It\u2019s a whole new ball game.\u201d\u000a\u000aEarlier in the day, Trump doubled down on his \u201cfire and fury\u201d warning to North Korea, saying the country should be "very, very nervous" about even thinking of attacking the United States or its allies.\u000a\u000aTRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON \u2018FIRE AND FURY\u2019\u000a\u000aIt was the latest escalation for tensions that have been rising for days with North Korea. On Tuesday, Trump reacted to reports that North Korea had produced a compact nuclear warhead by warning the country that they \u201cwill be met with fire and fury\u201d if they mess with the United States.\u000a\u000aHours after Trump\u2019s original warning, state media in North Korea reported that its leaders were seriously considering a plan to fire missiles at Guam.\u000a\u000aAside from responding to that threat, Trump covered a variety of other topics during his session Thursday with reporters, including U.S. nuclear posture, the nuclear agreement with Iran, Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019d like to de-nuke the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would like Russia, the United States and China and Pakistan and many other countries that have nuclear weapons get rid of them. But until such time that they do, we will be the most powerful nuclear nation on earth, by far.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump spoke of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran, saying he doesn\u2019t think they are \u201cin compliance with the agreement\u201d as negotiated.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re living up to the spirit of the agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Obama in his wisdom gave them $150 billion. He gave them $1.8 billion in cash. That\u2019s a hard one to figure. But that was his decision. I think it\u2019s a horrible agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added: \u201cI think you\u2019ll see some very strong things taking place if they don\u2019t get themselves in compliance.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president also discussed the investigation into Russia\u2019s attempted meddling in the election, saying he hasn\u2019t considered firing Mueller, as has been speculated.\u000a\u000a\u201cI haven\u2019t given it any thought,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been reading about it from you people. You say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to dismiss him.\u2019 No, I\u2019m not dismissing anybody. I mean, I want them to get on with the task.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president also defended his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, after reports this week that the FBI had raided his home as part of the Russia investigation.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo do that early in the morning, whether or not it was appropriate you\u2019d have to ask them. I\u2019ve always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aAsked about Russian president Vladimir Putin expelling U.S. diplomats from Russia, the president portrayed as it as a positive thing for taxpayers.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to thank him because we\u2019re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I\u2019m concerned I\u2019m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe also continued to swipe at McConnell, the Senate majority leader, whom he has been dinging on Twitter this week for not being able to pass health care legislation in the Senate.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Mitch,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf he gets these bills passed, I\u2019ll be very happy with him and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump expressed confidence in McMaster, his national security adviser, who has come under fire from conservatives in recent days.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s our friend. He\u2019s my friend and he\u2019s a very talented man. I like him and I respect him,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aThe president was also asked about the state of his relationship with Jeff Sessions, his attorney general whom he has criticized recently for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.

aVGeneral Stanley McCrystal and Chris Fussell who is the author of "One Mission: How Leaders Build A Team Of Teams", joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss North Korea. They started off talking about the President's controversial comments. General McCrystal said, "I think you have to measure your words and don't think it was helpful. I would have advised against it." Chris Fussell, a former Navy Seal Officer, said, "The rhetoric can really be dangerous if you look at it from the other side. Put it this way, if you don't give an exit to an enemy prepare to get into a big fight." On the possibility of a negotiated peace, the General went on to elaborate by saying "It's hard for me to see any scenario in which the current North Korean regime would see an upside in retreating from their current plan of building a nuclear capable North Korea." However, McCrystal did see a potential positive outcome in Afghanistan. " I think we can win. It will not be easy and will be expensive over time, but I do believe it can be accomplished. Afganistan is an important relationship for us maintain."\u000a\u000aFor More Listen Here:
