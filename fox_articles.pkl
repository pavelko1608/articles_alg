VBy Christian Toto, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf\u2019s Trump hate save his career? The Transformers star is in big trouble. Again. Could his ardent hate for President Trump help him bounce back?\u000a\u000aMel Gibson couldn\u2019t get arrested in Hollywood following his oh, so famous public meltdown in 2006.\u000a\u000aThe Lethal Weapon star ranted against the Jews while being cuffed on DUI charges. It took years for Gibson to get in the industry\u2019s good graces again. He apologized repeatedly, kept a low profile and performed in some indie films before winning raves for his 2016 war film Hacksaw Ridge.\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf follow in Gibson\u2019s tainted footsteps? Or will the actor\u2019s anti-Trump performance art buffer him against a similar career catastrophe?

aVBy Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com\u000a\u000aAs the investigation into why former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz failed to fire IT staffer Imran Awan after he allegedly stole House property, wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan and was arrested at the airport for bank fraud, the Congresswoman is accusing the police and FBI agents of racism. Further, she's essentially calling investigators Islamophobic because Awan is Muslim.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen their investigation was reviewed with me, I was presented with no evidence of anything that they were being investigated for. And so that in me gave me great concern that his due process rights were being violated. That there were racial and ethnic profiling concerns that I had,\u2019\u201d Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel in an exclusive interview.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz has been under heavy criticism for failing to fire Awan after he was fired by every other Democrat he worked for on Capitol Hill. In February Awan and his brother were banned from working on House systems or computers after evidence of wrongdoing started to surface. Wasserman Schultz kept him on board as a staffer until the end of July and finally fired him after he was arrested at the airport attempting to leave the country.

aVIn a fiery polemic on our personal finances, Gerri Willis, anchor and personal finance correspondent for Fox Business News, reveals how liberal policy has decimated our wallets.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Rich Is Not a Four-Letter Word, veteran financial journalist and pundit Gerri Willis takes on the progressive mind-set championed by liberals that gives government bureaucrats the right to decide what's best for us, resulting in bigger government programs, more bureaucracy, and more wasted taxpayer money. She dissects Obamacare and Democratic tax initiatives to show how they have hamstrung the average American. Then she shows us how to overcome these left wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the topics she tackles in the book: (1) How the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom (a new Blackrock survey shows that 4 out of 10 Americans haven't even started saving for retirement)--and how to get it back; (2) How the wide-open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year--and how we can successfully navigate the system; (3)How, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored health-care coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies have begun to abandon employee health-care coverage and opt to pay a less expensive federal penalty; (4) Why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.

aVIran signed the country's biggest-ever car deal on Monday to build tens of thousands of cars annually under a joint venture with French automobile manufacturer Groupe Renault, buoying its manufacturing industry in defiance of the Trump administration's moves to isolate the country.\u000a\u000aThe \u20ac660 million \u2014 or $778 million \u2014 deal follows the lifting of the U.N. and European Union sanctions after Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers to curb its controversial uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aIt also comes just days after new U.S. sanctions on Iran were signed by President Donald Trump, who spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend about ways to counter Iran's influence in Mideast conflicts. The U.S. legislation, first passed by Congress, imposes penalties on people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.\u000a\u000aAmerican businesses have been cautious about pursuing business deals with Iran due to U.S. sanctions in place not related to the nuclear program.\u000a\u000aAsian and European companies, meanwhile, have raced for a share of Iran's sizable consumer market since international sanctions were lifted. Iran, with its population of 80 million people, sits atop the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-biggest reserves of natural gas. It also has well-established manufacturing and agricultural industries.\u000a\u000aJust last month, France Total SA and state-run China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop the country's massive offshore natural gas field in the first such deal since the landmark nuclear deal was struck. Also, Washington granted permission to Chicago-based Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars' worth of aircraft to Iran in September 2016.\u000a\u000aRenault and other European companies are looking to rebuild their presence in Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Renault says that in the first half of 2017, its sales in Iran increased by more than 100 percent to 68,365 vehicles \u2014 a nearly 10 percent market share.\u000a\u000aThe new deal, first reached with Iran's government last September, will see Renault produce 150,000 vehicles a year in Iran at a plant located 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside Tehran. The plant will produce Duster and Symbol cars starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aRenault, a majority shareholder with a 60 percent share in the deal, will have its own distribution network in Iran for the first time. The company has been operating in Iran since 2003, though operations were halted when Iran came under international sanctions over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aDuring the signing ceremony in Tehran, Iran's Minister of Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said the deal with Renault would "establish a research and development center for designing" in the country.\u000a\u000aA Renault executive, Thierry Bolloré, said it would help transfer technology to Iran and reinforce Groupe Renault's position there.\u000a\u000a"This joint venture will enable an acceleration of our growth in this country," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe car deal is expected to create about 3,000 jobs for the two Iranian companies involved: IDRO, or the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and the privately-owned Negin Group, which imports Renault products to Iran.\u000a\u000aAlso last year, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen reached a deal to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually in Iran. Peugeot was a major player in Iran's car market before international sanctions were imposed.\u000a\u000aIran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year, though authorities hope that number will reach 3 million annually by 2025.

But his treatment involved a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a natural resistance to HIV, which is risky and impractical due to the large number of patients already infected.\u000a\u000aWhat's hopeful about the girl's case, is that she is the third child to enter long remission after beginning aggressive treatment soon after infection. She started when she was two and stopped 40 weeks later. Tests found the virus was not capable of reproducing in her immune system cells.\u000a\u000aFor more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.\u000a\u000aHousecall for Health, I'm Alex Hein, FOX News.

aVAttorney General Jeff Sessions fired back Monday at the lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago over the Justice Department\u2019s threat to withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities, saying \u201cno amount\u201d of money will help a city that won\u2019t help its own residents.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis administration is committed to the rule of law and to enforcing the laws established by Congress. To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country\u2019s lawful immigration system,\u201d Sessions said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe city filed its suit over the Justice Department's threat to withhold Byrne grants for law enforcement groups from sanctuary cities. The city\u2019s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, likened this to \u201cblackmail.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming city,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe federal government should be working with cities to provide necessary resources to improve public safety, not concocting new schemes to reduce our crime-fighting resources.\u201d\u000a\u000aSessions said the city of Chicago has chosen to protect \u201ccriminal aliens who prey on their own residents\u201d instead of enforcing laws meant to protect law enforcement.\u000a\u000aThe attorney general called the \u201copen hostility\u201d against protecting law enforcement -- while protecting criminal aliens -- \u201castounding\u201d given the influx of Chicago\u2019s violence crime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe city\u2019s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve,\u201d Sessions continued.\u000a\u000aThe grants, named for former New York City police officer Edward Byrne, who was murdered in 1988, would provide $3.2 million to Chicago, to be used for police vehicles. Funding from the grant is a small fraction of the city's budget.\u000a\u000aA requirement added to the grants would force local jurisdictions to report to federal officials of the release of illegal immigrants from police custody at least 48 hours in advance, which Emanuel said would violate citizens\u2019 \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d\u000a\u000aCRIME-RIDDEN CHICAGO SUES DOJ OVER SANCTUARY CITIES\u000a\u000aEmanuel \u201ccomplains that the federal government\u2019s focus on enforcing the law would require a \u2018reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago,\u2019\u201d Sessions said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that rollback the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cChicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated. And Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\u000a\u000aDOJ THREATENS TO WITHHOLD CRIME-FIGHTS FUNDS FROM FOUR SANCTUARY CITIES\u000a\u000aEmanual said he did not think Chicago would be the last sanctuary city to file a lawsuit of this nature. Other cities the DOJ contacted about withholding funds of this nature include Baltimore, Albuquerque, N.M., and Stockton and San Bernardino, Calif.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,\u201d Sessions concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s this simple: Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars.\u201d

It was, he claims, punishment for his "condemnation of white supremacy." The word "blackball" is defined as "to vote against, especially to veto the admission of," and "to shut out from social or commercial participation; ostracize or boycott."

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

The Nazi dictator intended to strike a second blow to an America still reeling from the attacks at Pearl Harbor just six months earlier. But the U.S. Coast Guard and the FBI uncovered the plot and tracked down the enemy agents. These saboteurs met their fate in a secret military trial that is still controversial to this day.\u000a\u000aThis group of saboteurs was not the first Nazi agents discovered on American soil. In New York in 1941, 44 men and women were arrested as part of a spy ring that sent American military secrets back to Germany. What is shocking about these two episodes of sabotage is that all the men and women working for Hitler lived here in America. They spoke English, worked in American factories and businesses, many were American citizens. Yet they believed in Nazi Germany and many were involved in a sinister pro-Hitler organization based right here in America called the German American Bund. They seemed like Americans, but they came to kill.\u000a\u000aIn this episode of "War Stories With Oliver North," you'll hear the fascinating tales of enemy agents infiltrating the United States.

They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis | Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVPhiladelphia's tax on sugary drinks has made soda more expensive than beer in the city.\u000a\u000aThe Tax Foundation released a new study on the excise tax last week, finding that the 1.5-cent per ounce tax has fallen short of revenue projections, cost jobs, and has forced some Philadelphians to drive outside the city to buy groceries.\u000a\u000aThe study finds that the tax is 24 times higher than the Pennsylvania tax rate on beer.\u000a\u000a"Purchases of beer are also now less expensive than nonalcoholic beverages subject to the tax in the city," according to the study, written by Courtney Shupert and Scott Drenkard. "Empirical evidence from a 2012 journal article suggests that soda taxes can push consumers to alcohol, meaning it is likely the case that consumers are switching to alcoholic beverages as a result of the tax. The paper, aptly titled From Coke to Coors, further shows that switching from soda to beer increases total caloric intake, even as soda taxes are generally aimed at caloric reduction."\u000a\u000aThe Tax Foundation points out that unlike most cities, Philadelphia passed the tax specifically to raise revenue, not to fight obesity. The city even includes diet sodas in its tax, as a way to raise money for pre-kindergarten programs.\u000a\u000aHowever, less than half of the $39.4 million collected since the tax went into effect on Jan. 1 has gone to education funding.\u000a\u000aClick for more from The Washington Free Beacon.

aVBy Steve Cortes | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe song Chicago, made famous by Old Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, refers to Chicago as a \u201ctoddlin\u2019 town.\u201d Sadly today, thanks to decades of dreadful leadership, Chicago more resembles a \u201ctottering\u201d town, as in a place nearing collapse.\u000a\u000aLet me preface my indictment of Chicago and particularly Mayor Rahm Emanuel with the important disclaimer that I love this city and I\u2019ve raised a family here for two decades. If cut, I would bleed the orange and navy of the Monsters of the Midway, my beloved Chicago Bears.\u000a\u000aBut no amount of hometown affinity can color the reality of a city in systemic decline. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that from 2015 to 2016, Cook County \u2013 where Chicago is located \u2013 lost more people than any county in America. A U-Haul rental from Chicago to Texas can cost as much as six times more than the return trip, an indicator of the heavy outward flow of people. It\u2019s no wonder people vote with their feet and escape the endemic corruption, escalating taxes, and rampant crime. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly on Fox News, Chicago is certainly the most dangerous place in the developed world, with over 2,200 shooting already this year.\u000a\u000aSo what is Mayor Emanuel doing to address this migration out of our city? How is he ameliorating the mammoth $838 million property tax increase that\u2019s crushing disposable incomes in our city? Is he searching for solutions for the most under-funded pension system in America, obligations that will cripple our budget in just a few years? Is Rahm empowering police to stem the bloody carnage that afflicts the streets, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods?

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVSex sells, but is there a limit to how much titillation consumers want?\u000a\u000aChocotravel is a ticketing service based in Kazakhstan that is apparently looking to make a splash with their new app. To their credit, they picked pretty much the most straight-forward way to advertize \u2014 with plenty of skin.\u000a\u000aHowever, the ads have left both the travel industry and consumers shaking their heads.\u000a\u000aThe barely-there wardrobes in the ad were apparently supposed to have a purpose: to highlight the nothing-added fee structure of the company. Yet, the message that was actually communicated was more along the lines of "buy our product because of these attractive ladies."\u000a\u000aIf you're thinking that Chocotravel was just catering to one gender, you would be mistaken, because the company responded to claims of sexism by digging their proverbial hole even further and releasing a second video featuring some men showing \u2014 as they say \u2014 the "Full Monty."\u000a\u000aHere's a pro tip for any companies that might be foolish enough to copy this advertising strategy: If you're looking to get past a charge of sexism, making sure all of your pilots are males and all of your attendants are female isn't the way to do it.\u000a\u000aThe backlash to the company has been fierce thanks to internet comments, and plenty of digital ink has already been spilled on the matter. The company's director isn't convinced the criticisms are correct, however, and has responded via his personal Facebook page, as reported by the BBC.\u000a\u000a"On his Facebook page, Chocotravel Ticketing Service director, Nikolay Mazensev, has responded to the criticism saying the clips were "bold and outrageous and we did not mean to offend."\u000a\u000aHe adds: "It shows no less than you'd see on the beach or by the pool. Do you attack girls in short skirts or swimsuits?"\u000a\u000aWhether or not Chocotravel benefits from the ads or decides to change strategy in future campaigns remains to be seen. What is clear is that they've made a splash in the market place \u2014 though slightly bigger and messier than they likely intended.

aVBy Dr. Keith Ablow | Fox News\u000a\u000aNew Planned Parenthood guidelines for parents now advise that children as young as four years old be informed that having a penis or a vagina doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are male or female. Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches. Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.

aVThese days, the price of a San Francisco home can easily top a million dollars. But one savvy investor has bought up a whole street in the city's most exclusive neighborhood for a mere $90,000.\u000a\u000aTrouble is, some of the extremely wealthy residents of Presidio Terrace were not aware their street was up for sale and are not pleased it has been sold.\u000a\u000aPresidio Terrace is an oval shaped street sealed off by a gate from the tony Presidio Heights neighborhood. Lined with towering palm trees and multimillion dollar mansions, the street has been home, over the years, to famous residents including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThanks to a city auction stemming from an unpaid tax bill, Bay Area real estate investor Michael Cheng, and his wife Tina Lam, bought the street and now own the sidewalks, the street itself and other areas of "common ground" in the private development that, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, has been managed by the homeowners association since at least 1905.\u000a\u000aCheng says reaction to the sale has been less than neighborly.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"I thought they would reach out to us and invite us in as new neighbors," Cheng told The Associated Press. "This has certainly blown up a lot more than we expected."\u000a\u000aIt turns out the homeowners association for Presidio Terrace failed to pay a $14-a-year property tax, something that owners of all 181 private streets in San Francisco must do, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aSo the city's tax office put the property up for sale at the cost of $994 in an online auction to regain unpaid back taxes, penalties and interest. The couple eventually won the street with a $90,100 bid in an April 2015 auction.\u000a\u000aScott Emblidge, the attorney for the Presidio Homeowners Association, said in a letter to the city that the owners failed to pay because the tax bill was mistakenly being sent to the address of an accountant who hadn't worked for the homeowners association since the 1980s, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aEmblidge said the residents didn't know their street was put on the auction block, let alone sold, until May when a title search company hired by Cheng and Lam reached out to ask if any residents had interest in buying back the property.\u000a\u000aThat was one of several options Cheng and Lam have considered for making the investment pay off.\u000a\u000aAnother option is to charge residents to park on their street \u2014 and rent out the 120 parking spaces that line the grand circular road.\u000a\u000a"As legal owners of this property, we have a lot of options," Cheng said, adding that nothing has been decided.\u000a\u000aThe matter could be headed for court.\u000a\u000aLast month, the homeowners petitioned the Board of Supervisors for a hearing to rescind the tax sale. The board has scheduled a hearing for October. The homeowners association has also sued the couple and the city, seeking to block Cheng and Lam from selling the street to anyone while the city appeal is pending.

aVEvangelical supporters of President Donald Trump on Monday requested a meeting with Pope Francis over a recent critical article in a Vatican-vetted journal.\u000a\u000aJohnnie Moore, a leader of Trump's evangelical advisory board and a spokesman for some of its members, said he sent the request to Rome in response to an article published last month that accused some American Catholics of building an alliance of "hate" with evangelicals who backed the president.\u000a\u000aThe two authors of the piece are confidants of Francis. They published their article in the Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica, which is reviewed by the Vatican Secretariat of State.\u000a\u000aMoore said he sought the meeting with the pope and Vatican officials to address "efforts to divide Catholics and Evangelicals."\u000a\u000a"We think it would be of great benefit to sit together and to discuss these things. Then, when we disagree we can do it within the context of friendship," Moore wrote in his letter to the pontiff.\u000a\u000aThe July 13 article warned that the decades-old political alliance between some American Catholics and evangelicals had "gradually radicalized" to promote conflict and hatred and a "xenophobic and Islamophobic vision that wants walls and purifying deportations."\u000a\u000aFrancis has made helping refugees and immigrants a top priority of his papacy. Trump has sought to bar travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The president has said the measures were key to fighting terrorism and protecting national security.\u000a\u000aThe article has prompted an outpouring of criticism from conservative American Catholics and evangelicals, who contend the article grossly misrepresents their views to make a political point. The article's authors have stood by their conclusions, re-posting the piece regularly on Twitter over the last month.

aVFive years after touching down on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover mission is still making big discoveries.\u000a\u000aOn the night of Aug. 5, 2012, the car-size robot aced a dramatic and harrowing landing, settling softly onto the Red Planet's surface after being lowered on cables by a rocket-powered "sky crane." The success of this unprecedented (and seemingly improbable) maneuver sparked eruptions of emotion at mssion control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California \u2014 and at late-night viewing parties all over the world.\u000a\u000aCuriosity landed on Mars at 10:17 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5, that's 1:17 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6 (0517 GMT), with the signal of its success reaching Earth 14 minutes later after crossing the 154 million miles between Mars and Earth.\u000a\u000aWithin weeks of its arrival inside Mars' 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, Curiosity hit scientific pay dirt, rolling through an ancient streambed where water once flowed. And, not long after that, mission scientists revealed a bombshell: Billions of years ago, a nearby area known as Yellowknife Bay was part of a lake that could have supported microbial life. [The 10 Biggest Moments from Curiosity's First 5 Years on Mars]\u000a\u000aBut that's not where Curiosity's story ends. The rover has continued to piece together details about the ancient Gale Crater environment \u2014 work that has led to another exciting find.\u000a\u000a"I feel like we're arriving at a second conclusion from the mission that's just as powerful as the first, which is that habitable environments persisted on Mars for at least millions of years," Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada, of JPL, told Space.com.\u000a\u000aRolling up Mount Sharp\u000a\u000aCuriosity worked near its landing site on Gale's floor for its first year on Mars. Then, the nuclear-powered rover began a 5-mile (8 km) trek to the towering Mount Sharp, which rises about 3.4 miles (5.5 km) into the Red Planet sky from Gale's center.\u000a\u000aThe mountain's foothills had long been Curiosity's main science destination, even before the rover's November 2011 launch. Mission team members wanted the six-wheeled robot to work its way up through Mount Sharp's lower reaches, studying the rock layers there for clues about Mars' long-ago transition from a relatively warm and wet world to the cold, arid place it is today.\u000a\u000aAnd that's what Curiosity has been doing for the past three years. Since arriving at Mount Sharp in September 2014, the robot has climbed about 600 vertical feet (180 meters), drilling, sampling and studying numerous rocks that are part of a geological division that mission scientists call the Murray Formation.\u000a\u000aCuriosity found that most of this rock is fine-grained mudstone \u2014 classic lake-bed deposits, Vasavada said. Such deposits on Earth generally take millions of years to accumulate, leading the team to conclude that Gale Crater's lake system was long-lasting.\u000a\u000aThat's a big deal, because Curiosity's work at Yellowknife Bay captured just "a snapshot in time," Vasavada said.\u000a\u000aBased on the initial findings, "that lake may only have been around for 100 or 1,000 years at the minimum," he said. "There was a risk that our habitability discovery only applied to a short amount of time." [Photos: Ancient Mars Lake Could Have Supported Life]\u000a\u000aMore work to do\u000a\u000aCuriosity has already seen some changes during its climb up Mount Sharp. For example, the mudstone was pretty much continuous at and near the mountain's base, but that finely grained stuff gets broken up by other deposits closer to the top of the Murray Formation, Vasavada said.\u000a\u000a"There are intervals of deposits that are consistent with forming in near-shore environments where rivers are reaching the edge of the lake, or even in dry environments where the lake has presumably receded," he said. "But the lake then reappears."\u000a\u000aAnd Gale Crater likely remained habitable even through such periodic dry spells, Vasavada added. That's because groundwater probably remained, even if the lake site was dry on the surface.\u000a\u000aThis groundwater also outlasted the lakes, he said. Mission scientists know this because Curiosity has spotted evidence that liquid water flowed through Gale's lake deposits after they dried out and were buried, compressed and fractured.\u000a\u000a"So there's a whole other era of water that's, by definition, after the lakes," Vasavada said. "It suggests that the water was there even longer than the timescale of the lakes."\u000a\u000aVasavada and his colleagues hope to learn more about this other era, and Gale's early history in general, as Curiosity goes higher up the mountain. Ideally, mission scientists would like to reach three other rock layers that are above the Murray Formation. The first is Vera Rubin Ridge, a feature with lots of the iron-containing mineral hematite; the second is a clay-rich unit; and the third is one dominated by sulfates.\u000a\u000aThe clay unit was probably exposed to lots of liquid water in the ancient past, whereas sulfates imply that water was scarcer, Vasavada said.\u000a\u000a"There's this idea that you go from the clays to the sulfates, and you're going to be witnessing some kind of drying out of the environment at Gale Crater," he said. "Whether that has anything to do with the global drying out of Mars we'd love to figure out. But at the very least, it's a major environmental change within Gale Crater."\u000a\u000aCuriosity has already been eyeing Vera Rubin Ridge and should start studying the formation in earnest in the next month or two, Vasavada said. If everything goes according to plan, the rover should get to the clay unit by the end of the year and arrive at the sulfate region, which is about 650 feet (200 m) above Curiosity's current location, a year or two after that.\u000a\u000a"In the next three years or so, we'll probably see all of those units," Vasavada said.\u000a\u000aIn good health (mostly)\u000a\u000aCuriosity has already far outlasted its warranty; the rover's $2.5 billion mission was originally scheduled to last just two Earth years.\u000a\u000aBut there's no reason to think Curiosity won't be able to power through three more years on the Red Planet; the rover is in good shape overall, Vasavada said. (The mission team has been able to slow an initially worrying rate of wheel damage, primarily by choosing routes with softer ground, he added.)\u000a\u000aBut one major health problem continues to afflict Curiosity: The rover has been unable to use its drill since December 2016. This is a big blow, because the drill \u2014 which sits at the end of Curiosity's 7-foot-long (2.1 m) robotic arm \u2014 allows the robot to access the pristine interiors of rocks and, therefore, characterize ancient environments. (Without this capability, the rover is mostly limited to analyzing surface material such as sand, which was shaped and altered in the recent past.)\u000a\u000aThe issue lies in the drill feed mechanism, which moves the drill bit forward and backward. Until about a month ago, Curiosity engineers were focused primarily on diagnosing the problem and fixing it in a way that would restore normal drill operations, Vasavada said. But the team is now investigating an alternative drilling method \u2014 using the arm itself, not the feed motor, to move the drill.\u000a\u000a"That requires a lot of work \u2014 to figure out if that's safe, and to figure out how to do it, and how to command it," Vasavada said. "But it's promising, and that may be where we concentrate our efforts going forward."\u000a\u000aThough he and other mission team members are chiefly concerned with the future \u2014 fixing the drill and continuing Curiosity's climb up Mount Sharp, for example \u2014 the events of Aug. 5, 2012, still have a special place in Vasavada's heart.\u000a\u000a"When I look at the landing video, I still get really emotional; I have a hard time giving talks when I show the video, because it takes me like a minute to recover," he said. "It's remembering the emotion of that night, where your whole career is depending on seven minutes of this stuff going right \u2014 and when it actually did work, realizing that you had a future."\u000a\u000aNote: Space.com Senior Producer Steve Spaleta contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+ .

aVHackers using the name "Mr. Smith" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online Monday, and demanded that HBO pay a ransom of several million dollars in bitcoin to prevent further such releases.\u000a\u000aThe data dump included what appear to be scripts from five "Game of Thrones" episodes, including one upcoming episode, and a month's worth of email from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\u000a\u000aThe latest leak is a half-gigabyte sample of the 1.5 terabytes of data the hackers have claimed to steal, according to Wired. All of the leaked "Game of Thrones" scripts include a watermark with the hackers\u2019 motto, \u201cHBO is falling.\u201d The data dump also includes internal documents like emails, financial balance sheets, employment agreements, and marketing strategy.\u000a\u000aHBO, which previously acknowledged the theft of "proprietary information," said it's continuing to investigate and is working with police and cybersecurity experts. The network said Monday that it still doesn't believe that its email system as a whole has been compromised.\u000a\u000aThis is the second data dump from the purported hacker. So far the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\u000a\u000aThose behind the HBO hack claim to have more data, including scripts, upcoming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO.\u000a\u000aIn a video directed to HBO CEO Richard Plepler, "Mr. Smith" used white text on a black background to threaten further disclosures if HBO doesn't pay up. To stop the leaks, the purported hackers demanded "our 6 month salary in bitcoin," which they implied is at least $6 million.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"Our demand is clear and Non-Negotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your Data," the letter reads.

aVNASA's New Horizons spacecraft may double its pleasure during its next deep-space flyby 16 months from now.\u000a\u000aOn Jan. 1, 2019, New Horizons is scheduled to have a close encounter with a body called 2014 MU69, which lies 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto in the distant, frigid Kuiper Belt. (The probe famously zoomed past Pluto in July 2015, returning the first-ever up-close images of that mysterious world. This second flyby is the key component of New Horizons' extended mission.)\u000a\u000aNot much is known about 2014 MU69, so the New Horizons team planned out a campaign to watch the object pass in front of background stars. Such "occultations" can reveal a great deal about the foreground body, including its size and shape. [Destination Pluto: NASA's New Horizons Mission in Pictures]\u000a\u000aMission team members decamped to various spots around the globe to watch three occultations this year, one each on June 2, July 10 and July 17. Observations of the most recent one, which scientists made from southern Argentina, suggest that 2014 MU69 may actually be two separate bodies, New Horizons team members said.\u000a\u000aThese two objects may be orbiting each other closely, or they could be touching, the team members added.\u000a\u000a"This new finding is simply spectacular. The shape of MU69 is truly provocative, and could mean another first for New Horizons going to a binary object in the Kuiper Belt," mission principal investigator Alan Stern, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement. "I could not be happier with the occultation results, which promise a scientific bonanza for the flyby."\u000a\u000aIt's also possible that 2014 MU69 is a single object \u2014 one that's relatively long and skinny, or a more spherical one with a big chunk taken out of it, NASA officials said. Further analysis of the occultation data may allow New Horizons team members to get to the bottom of the mystery, the officials added.\u000a\u000aThanks to the occultation observations, MU69's size is now better understood as well. If the flyby target is a single body, it's no more than 19 miles (30 km) long. If it's a binary, each of the two pieces is 9 miles to 12 miles (15 to 20 km) long, mission scientists said.\u000a\u000aThe occultation campaign was an extensive effort that involved a number of assets and instruments. For example, NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) \u2014 a 747 jet equipped with a 100-inch (2.5 meters) telescope \u2014 observed the July 10 event. And mission team members used observations by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft to choose the best viewing spots on the ground.\u000a\u000a"Both of these space satellites were crucial to the success of the entire occultation campaign," Stern said.\u000a\u000aFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+ .

Through recently discovered sermons, interviews with Robinson\u2019s family and friends, and even an unpublished book by the player himself, Henry details a side of Jackie\u2019s humanity that few have taken the time to see.\u000a\u000aBranch Rickey, the famed owner who risked it all by signing Jackie to his first contract, is also shown as a complex individual who wanted nothing more than to make his God-fearing mother proud of him. Few know the level at which Rickey struggled with his decision, only moving forward after a private meeting with a minister he\u2019d just met. It turns out Rickey was not as certain about signing Robinson as historians have always assumed.\u000a\u000aWith many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized.\u000a\u000aThis book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson\u2019s already awe-inspiring legacy.

Vonderheide was armed with the ice ax, but the only traces they found of the mountain lion were the paw marks it left behind.\u000a\u000aWildlife biologist Daniel Gammons said the men did the right thing by staying calm. Biologists say you should make yourself appear big by waving your arms overhead and scare off the animal, as the men did.\u000a\u000a"The big thing these visitors did right was that they didn't panic and run," Gammons said. "Probably the most important message to get out to visitors is not to act like prey if they encounter a mountain lion."\u000a\u000aWhile the encounter was terrifying, McKinney said he and Vonderheide had discussed spotting a puma.\u000a\u000a"When we started the trip, we sort of jokingly said, 'Wouldn't it be great if we saw the trifecta of a rattlesnake, a bear and a mountain lion?' " he said. "And sure enough, we got our wish."

aVBarry Bonds so badly wanted to play one final season.\u000a\u000aOn the 10th anniversary of breaking baseball's all-time home run mark, Bonds told The Associated Press on Monday night that believes he would have hit 800 homers or come very close.\u000a\u000aBonds said it "stung" to walk away from a decorated 22-year career with little notice immediately after a record-setting 2007 season with the San Francisco Giants in which he topped Hank Aaron's mark.\u000a\u000aBonds said there were never discussions about him playing for the Giants in 2008. He also said he didn't push for it because, "I was just told I'm not coming back and that was it."\u000a\u000aThe 53-year-old Bonds now works for the Giants. He was at AT&T Park on Monday night, the same place he hit No. 756 to pass Aaron.\u000a\u000aBonds finished with 762 home runs. The seven-time NL MVP finished his career under the cloud of steroids allegations.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, it should have only been nine (years ago). I should have played one more year, I should have had the chance to," Bonds said, standing behind the batting cage.\u000a\u000a"It's all right, though. Those 22 were still good. I wish I could have gotten to retire better, or just walk away better, whatever it was, however you want to call it," he said.\u000a\u000aBonds waved from the broadcast booth when he was shown on the big board before the top of the third inning, when highlights of his record-setting homer were played.\u000a\u000a"I was what (38) away from 800? I'd have been real close. I would have never hit under 20-something, no matter what," Bonds said.\u000a\u000aHours earlier, Bonds spent time chatting up his 2007 manager, current San Francisco skipper Bruce Bochy, and giving some guidance to Pablo Sandoval and Jarrett Parker between their turns taking batting practice.\u000a\u000aBonds said he hadn't even thought about this being 10 years since his milestone home run until hearing from the team with an invite to the ballpark Monday, when the Giants hosted the World Series champion Chicago Cubs.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know it was 10 years," he said. "I didn't even know I was out of baseball 10 years. It feels like just yesterday," he said.\u000a\u000aAs the Giants hitters got loose, Bonds pondered what might have been with a season more of chances.\u000a\u000a"It always will eat at you in a way, always, because it just wasn't right the way it was done. It is what it is. Just to say goodbye like that after all, that's not cool," he said.\u000a\u000a"But I've learned to overcome it and accept it and move on. If I didn't overcome it I wouldn't be back here. There's no reason to subject myself to that kind of stuff. If it wasn't for me to just overcome it then just say, I played my 22 years, I had a great career, I love my city, the city loves me. That means more to me than anything. You've got to weigh it all. Great community, great city, great fans here, family I say mostly, that's what they are."\u000a\u000aIn July 2015, Bonds said he had a huge "weight lifted" when federal prosecutors dropped what was left of their criminal case against him after a nearly decade-long steroids prosecution.\u000a\u000aBonds was on 53.8 percent of Hall of Fame ballots in this year's voting, up from 43.3 percent of ballots last year and 36.2 percent in his initial appearance.\u000a\u000a"I went to court, I won. Major League Baseball's not punishing me for anything," Bonds said. "If I did something wrong, then MLB can take it down. If you think I did something wrong or I violated a rule, which I never violate any rules in baseball, MLB's not the one punishing me. The media's punishing me, which is all right. If that's what they want to do, go ahead, do your thing."\u000a\u000aWhether he believes he will eventually be enshrined at Cooperstown, Bonds isn't ready to go there.\u000a\u000a"When the time comes I can answer that, but right now there's nothing really to answer," he said. "It's all a big why? I'm not the one doing it."\u000a\u000aFit and friendly, Bonds is now an avid cyclist. He finally got a plaque on the Giants Wall of Fame this spring.\u000a\u000aA jury found Bonds guilty in 2011 for giving a meandering answer to a federal grand jury in 2003 when asked whether his personal trainer gave him anything that required a syringe for self-injection. An 11-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that conviction in April 2015.\u000a\u000aBonds was charged in 2007, four years after his testimony before the grand jury after receiving a grant of immunity. He didn't dispute that he took steroids, but testified to the grand jury that his former trainer, Greg Anderson, told him they were flaxseed oil and arthritic balm.\u000a\u000aBonds hit 28 home runs and led the majors with a .480 on-base average in 2007. He never played after that.\u000a\u000a"Yeah, it stung at the time, hard. But we built a good franchise here," Bonds said. "The team was going to be sold at the time and when you weigh everything in it, we kept a great team in San Francisco, they're winning championships. The Bay Area's great, so who cares."

They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

Non-union or "at will" employees, such as most tech workers, can be fired in the United States for a wide array of reasons that have nothing to do with performance.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. National Labor Relations Act guarantees workers, whether they are in a union or not, the right to engage in "concerted activities" for their "mutual aid or protection".\u000a\u000aDamore, though, would likely face an uphill fight to seek that protection based on his memo, said Alison Morantz, a Stanford University law professor with expertise in labor law.\u000a\u000a"It's going to be a hard sell that this activity was either concerted or for mutual aid or protection, rather than simply venting or pitting one group of workers against the others, which does not sound very mutual," Morantz said.\u000a\u000aDebate over the treatment of women in the male-dominated tech industry has raged for months. Claims of persistent sexual harassment in the ranks of Uber Technologies Inc and of several venture capital firms led to management shakeups.\u000a\u000aManagement at the largest tech firms, including Google, have publicly committed to diversifying their workforces, although the percentage of women in engineering and management roles remains low at many companies.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Department of Labor is investigating whether Google has unlawfully paid women less than men. The company has denied the charges.\u000a\u000aDamore asserted in his 3,000-word document that circulated inside the company last week that "Google's left bias has created a politically correct monoculture" which prevented honest discussion of diversity.\u000a\u000aThe engineer, who has a doctoral degree in systems biology from Harvard University, according to his LinkedIn page, attacked the idea that gender diversity should be a goal.\u000a\u000a"The distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and ... these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership," Damore wrote in the memo.\u000a\u000aHe quickly received support in conservative media outlets. On Breitbart News, once run by Steve Bannon, now chief strategist to President Donald Trump, commentators overnight discussed whether to boycott Google and switch to services such as Microsoft Corp's Bing.\u000a\u000aGoogle's vice president of diversity, Danielle Brown, sent a memo in response to the furor over the weekend, saying the engineer's essay "advanced incorrect assumptions about gender".\u000a\u000a(Reporting by David Ingram in SAN FRANCISCO and Ishita Palli in BENGALURU; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Christopher Cushing)

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

aVWon't Back Down! Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly issued subpoenas to appear before the grand jury that he has convened to probe a meeting that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016. Two sources told Reuters of the move on Thursday, saying it was more proof that Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in last year's election was picking up speed. The former FBI director made headlines earlier in the day when it was revealed that he had impaneled a new grand jury to lead the probe. Trump Jr. and Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016 -- along with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- after being told that they would receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The meeting had been brokered by British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who has worked with the Trumps in the past.

Mr. Emanuel said the new rules would require cities to allow the Department of Homeland Security to have unlimited access to local police stations and law-enforcement facilities.\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming City,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said in a press release Sunday.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

aVBaseball executives say Major League Baseball appears to be growing impatient with the impasse over the sale of the Miami Marlins, and its commissioner may tell the team owner exactly that at next week\u2019s owner\u2019s meeting, FOX Business has learned.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aThe Marlin\u2019s owner, Jeffrey Loria, is still weighing three bids ranging from $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the financially struggling team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

As FOX Business was first to report, the Jeter group recently received an investment from a firm affiliated with personal computer impresario Michael Dell.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aBut Loria and his team\u2019s president David Samson have yet to name a winner of the bidding war, a move that is worrying some baseball executives and even some in the commissioner\u2019s office, sources tell FOX Business. The Marlins continue to lose money, have heavy debt and will be on the hook for major player contracts that have ballooning payments in the years ahead.\u000a\u000aBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred may alert Loria to his concerns about the team, and the prolonged bidding process at the owner\u2019s meeting in Chicago, scheduled to take place Aug. 16 and 17, these people add.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the Marlins didn\u2019t return a call for comment, nor did spokesmen for Mas, Rothbaum and Jeter.\u000a\u000aLoria has expressed interest in selling the Marlins since late last year, and the bidding war for the team\u2014one of the league\u2019s more mediocre franchises\u2014has captivated Major League Baseball for months because of the high-profile potential owners to have emerged. At one point, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as well as Tagg Romney, a hedge fund manager and son of 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, were heading bidding groups for the franchise.\u000a\u000aLoria paid $158 million for the team back in 2002, and the Marlins have struggled in recent years both on the field and financially with high levels of debt and operating losses. Still, Loria could fetch a significant premium in any sale given the scarcity of MLB teams available to be purchased.

aVThe Nintendo Switch ships with a number of input options out of the box due to the hybrid nature of the machine. But all of those methods involve the Joy-Cons. The other official input method Nintendo offers is the Pro Controller. However, the Switch is about to get an arcade stick thanks to 8Bitdo.\u000a\u000aThe stick is called the 8Bitdo NES30 and will cost $79.99 when it launches on August 20. Aimed squarely at gamers who enjoy playing Street Fighter or King of Fighters titles, the NES30 offers a joystick paired with eight 30mm buttons. It's also possible to fit one of the popular Sanwa joysticks or customize the buttons, and there's a turbo option and d-pad/joystick mode selection options.\u000a\u000aConnectivity is achieved via Bluetooth or USB, with a three meter USB cable included in the box. Charging the wireless arcade stick takes up to two hours, but in return you'll enjoy 18 hours of play time. The stick measure 300-by-226-by-116mm and weighs 1.4KG, so it shouldn't move around if you get a little aggressive during bouts.\u000a\u000aIf you think $80 for a Switch arcade stick sounds expensive, keep in mind 8Bitdo included compatibility beyond Nintendo's console. You can also use the NES30 with Windows PCs (Windows 7/8/8.1/10), Macs (macOS 10.7 and above), devices running Android 4.0 and above, and for Steam gaming (Windows 7/8/8.1/10 or macOS 10.9 and above).

An investigation, which pokes a constellation of holes in Dunham's story, suggests she might have fabricated, or at the very least exaggerated the incident - much like her recent excuses for abandoning her dog at a pound, and assorted lurid tales she alleged in her desperate, attention-craving memoir. In each case, she wasted the time of responsible, employed men and women - time that could have been better used to deal with actual concerns, instead of indulging a fantasist.

Nevertheless, the researchers hope the work will help programmers develop better defenses against these types of attacks.\u000a\u000aAs a backup to this type of situation, driverless cars use several inputs, including hyper accurate GPS mapping, to help them avoid issues caused by confusing signage, but still need to sort out the data to make the correct -- sometimes life or death -- decision.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Sun, the researchers suggest this kind of 'contextual' information is of the utmost importance to the safe operation of autonomous cars.\u000a\u000aUNBELTED REAR SEAT PASSENGERS CAN KILL DRIVERS IN A CRASH

The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. Killing the Rising Sun takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, Killing Patton, and Killing Reagan, this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before.

aVGoogle fired the worker whose controversial leaked memo claimed the company had an \u201cideological echo chamber\u201d that alienated conservatives, according to multiple reports late Monday.\u000a\u000aThe engineer, identified as James Damore, emailed Bloomberg to say he was fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d Recode also reported the firing, citing sources. Google did not immediately comment.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aEarlier, CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sent a note to employees saying that part of the engineer's memo violated the company\u2019s Code of Conduct by advancing \u201charmful gender stereotypes.\u201d The memo suggested women had biological issues that prohibited them from being equally as successful as their male counterparts in the tech industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,\u201d part of the CEO's note, entitled \u201cOur words matter,\u201d reportedly read.\u000a\u000aThe employee's memo, which was up for several days before going viral and igniting an internet firestorm over the weekend, attracted both vehement support and backlash. It reportedly left Google\u2019s top brass in the quandary of deciding whether it had gone too far beyond the realm of free speech.\u000a\u000aThe author started by stressing that he valued \u201cdiversity and inclusion,\u201d but that the matter required an \u201chonest discussion\u201d to truly solve the problem -- instead of silencing conservative voices, as he claimed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don\u2019t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,\u201d he wrote, adding that those differences include assertions that women tended to be more social and artistic thus could not take high pressure jobs, along with possessing traits such as neuroticism, higher anxiety and a lower tolerance to stress.\u000a\u000aSMOKE, THEN FIRE: UBER KNOWINGLY LEASED UNSAFE CARS TO DRIVERS\u000a\u000aPichai told employees that such views are not welcome in their work.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aTRANSGENDER CAMP OFFERS PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 4\u000a\u000aThe conflicting memos, however, reflect the challenges that Silicon Valley as a whole is currently grappling with when it comes to claims of extensive sexual harassment and discrimination.

aVBy Steve Cortes | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe song Chicago, made famous by Old Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, refers to Chicago as a \u201ctoddlin\u2019 town.\u201d Sadly today, thanks to decades of dreadful leadership, Chicago more resembles a \u201ctottering\u201d town, as in a place nearing collapse.\u000a\u000aLet me preface my indictment of Chicago and particularly Mayor Rahm Emanuel with the important disclaimer that I love this city and I\u2019ve raised a family here for two decades. If cut, I would bleed the orange and navy of the Monsters of the Midway, my beloved Chicago Bears.\u000a\u000aBut no amount of hometown affinity can color the reality of a city in systemic decline. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that from 2015 to 2016, Cook County \u2013 where Chicago is located \u2013 lost more people than any county in America. A U-Haul rental from Chicago to Texas can cost as much as six times more than the return trip, an indicator of the heavy outward flow of people. It\u2019s no wonder people vote with their feet and escape the endemic corruption, escalating taxes, and rampant crime. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly on Fox News, Chicago is certainly the most dangerous place in the developed world, with over 2,200 shooting already this year.\u000a\u000aSo what is Mayor Emanuel doing to address this migration out of our city? How is he ameliorating the mammoth $838 million property tax increase that\u2019s crushing disposable incomes in our city? Is he searching for solutions for the most under-funded pension system in America, obligations that will cripple our budget in just a few years? Is Rahm empowering police to stem the bloody carnage that afflicts the streets, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods?

aVOver the last six months the Trump administration has made good on its promise to enhance border security and enforce our immigration laws. In the first half of 2017, illegal border crossings fell by an estimated 70 percent. It is very reassuring to know that President Obama\u2019s reckless immigration policies are now over. An Executive Branch that is dedicated to fixing the problems along our southern border and actually enforcing our laws not only deters future illegal immigration, but is also absolutely necessary to protecting our homeland.\u000a\u000aHowever, we are constantly reminded that our borders and our immigration laws are still being exploited, including by those who are intent on doing Americans harm. For example, MS-13, a violent transnational gang controlled by members in El Salvador, has aggressively recruited minors who entered illegally at our southern border during recent surges of illegal immigration. Known for its brutal tactics of rape, theft, and homicide, this gang now has tens of thousands of members in cities all across the United States.\u000a\u000aThese dangers are not always brought on by transnational gangs however. In late July, a 65-year-old woman from Portland, Oregon, was assaulted by an illegal immigrant armed with a knife. The assailant had been previously deported over a dozen times. How did this man keep sneaking into our country and why are some localities undermining the enforcement of our immigration laws and their communities\u2019 safety?\u000a\u000aFurther, nine illegal immigrants were recently found dead in a sweltering tractor-trailer parked outside of a Walmart in Texas. Tragically, dozens more were sent to a nearby hospital; some with life-threating conditions. They were the victims of a heinous human smuggling operation.\u000a\u000aWe cannot be a safe nation if we have porous borders and our laws are not being fully enforced.\u000a\u000aHuman smugglers, violent criminals, drug smugglers, and international terrorists continue to do everything they can to break into America, creep into our neighborhoods, and take advantage of our society. This is completely unacceptable. We cannot be a safe nation if we have porous borders and our laws are not being fully enforced. We must tackle these problems head on.\u000a\u000aFortunately, we have introduced two important pieces of legislation in the House of Representatives that work together as a united front to strengthen our border security, strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws, and provide the Department of Homeland Security with the personnel and resources it needs to get the job done.\u000a\u000aThe Judiciary Committee has passed Representative Raùl Labrador\u2019s, R-Idaho, Davis-Oliver Act, named for two law enforcement officers from California who were killed by an illegal immigrant. This legislation removes the ability of any future president to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement by empowering state and local authorities to help enforce our immigration laws. State and local authorities are the front line in the fight against crime and encounter criminals every day in their communities. We must ensure that they are able to identify the drug dealers, murderers, drunk drivers, and spouse-abusers who are illegally present and work with federal immigration enforcement authorities to ensure their punishment and removal.\u000a\u000aThe legislation also withholds certain federal grants from jurisdictions that illegally prohibit their officers from cooperating with ICE; allows victims of crimes by illegal aliens to sue localities in instances where the locality\u2019s refusal to cooperate with ICE facilitated the crime; makes membership in a gang a deportable offense; and calls for additional ICE officers to enforce our laws; among other important provisions. This legislation is a necessary step towards keeping our communities safe.\u000a\u000aThe Homeland Security Committee\u2019s Border Security for America Act is a multi-layered approach that enhances the security of our southern border in a number of important ways.\u000a\u000aMost notably, this bill authorizes the construction of a border wall and provides $15 billion for the deployment of tactical infrastructure, technology, and other measures to achieve full operational control and situational awareness. President Trump repeatedly said that a wall was an important part of securing our border and this legislation will help make that happen. However, a wall will not solve this problem by itself.\u000a\u000aThis legislation improves and modernizes ports of entry to target illegal immigration while enhancing trade, authorizes the National Guard to assist with aviation intelligence support, and will ensure identification of visa overstays by requiring implementation of the Entry-Exit system Congress enacted over two decades ago to track the entry and exit of foreign nationals visiting our country. It also provides more boots on the ground by adding 5,000 Border Patrol Agents and 5,000 Customs and Border Protection Officers. We can have strong walls, solid intelligence, and advanced technology, but our strongest asset in the fight to control our borders are the brave men and women who patrol our borders.\u000a\u000aThe American people have made it clear that they want to see their leaders implement policies that will protect their families and their neighborhoods. A weak border and immigration laws that can be easily circumvented only allow new dangers to enter our country and threaten our citizens. Let\u2019s work together and pass these common sense proposals that will better enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws and provide all Americans the secure border they have long demanded and deserve.\u000a\u000aRepublican Michael McCaul, represents Texas' 10th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

aVHe cements the media\u2019s reputation as the opposition party.\u000a\u000aBy GEORGE NEUMAYR | The American Spectator\u000a\u000aIt is impossible to overstate the partisan jackassery of CNN, which is at once a product of the cynical, ratings-driven scumbaggery of its head Jeff Zucker and the pretentious liberalism of its \u201creporters,\u201d almost all of whom come from Democratic circles. What an astonishing collection of frauds. With their anchormanish baritones, they try to hoodwink viewers into thinking they are \u201cserious\u201d journalists. But they are all just liberal activists playing reporters on TV. Jake Tapper was a Dem staffer. So was Jim Sciutto. Christiane Amanpour, last heard lecturing journalists on the need to drop \u201cneutrality\u201d in its coverage of Trump, is married to former Clinton staffer James Rubin. And the list goes on and on.\u000a\u000aOut of this ethos came Jim Acosta, who, thanks to Trump, has justly become the face of fake news. Acosta\u2019s hectoring of Stephen Miller on Wednesday \u2014 behavior indistinguishable from a La Raza activist at a Trump rally \u2014 confirms once again the journalistic bankruptcy of Jeff Zucker\u2019s CNN. Acosta doesn\u2019t need any encouragement to be a demagogic jerk, but Zucker has no doubt flashed that green light to him. (By the way, where are the successors to the Kalb brothers to tsk-tsk Zucker for his complete abandonment of \u201cobjective\u201d journalistic conventions in pursuit of the cheapest of entertainment values? That even those old charades no longer occur is itself proof of the media\u2019s status as an unapologetic opposition party.)\u000a\u000aBut conservatives should thank Acosta for pulling off CNN\u2019s mask completely. It reveals the face of an exceedingly dumb and arrogant liberal. Poets, according to the windy adage, are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. But Acosta on Wednesday was determined to turn Emma Lazarus into an acknowledged one. He demanded to know why the Trump administration wasn\u2019t using her poem as the organizing principle of immigration policy.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

Do you feel marginalized by your college\u2019s mascot? Do you look for something to get outraged about, every single day, so you can fire off a tweet defending your exquisitely precious sensibilities? Then you\u2019re a Snowflake.\u000a\u000aSo again, are you drifting frozen precipitation? Or do you matriculate at the Old School fountain of wisdom?\u000a\u000aThis book will explain the looming confrontation so even the ladies on The View can understand it.\u000a\u000aTime to take a stand.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis | Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVThere\u2019s a palpable sadness in the air at Fox News Channel today. We learned over the weekend that one of our longtime fixtures, Rich O\u2019Brien, passed away.\u000a\u000aRich was a Sr. Vice President here and Creative Director. But titles didn\u2019t mean much to him\u2014everyone knew him as Rich\u2014the guy who gave Fox its distinctive on-air look.\u000a\u000aYou might not think much about graphics when you watch television, but Rich certainly did, and his keen eye and creative mind made Fox News better. He literally changed the look of cable news, not just at Fox, but at the competing networks as well\u2014when he\u2019d build a show open or create the animation to introduce a segment, the products were unfailingly eye-catching. They made you want to watch. Our competitors noticed, and soon they were trying to emulate what Rich was doing, while for his part, Rich was moving on to put something even more dazzling onscreen. He had that gift that drives so many creative people like him, the desire to look for and bring into being something better, something more interesting, some addition that helps tell a story. He\u2019d visit our studio during a live show, left hand propping up the right elbow, right hand in front of his chin. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d, he\u2019d wonder aloud. \u201cWhat if we moved that camera over there, and then put you here? Would that work?\u201d\u000a\u000aI remember once sitting in a recording booth here at Fox; Rich had asked me to be the voice of a very short promo his department was building. The script read, \u201cBefore it\u2019s history\u2026 it\u2019s news.\u201d Five little words. But for him, they had to have impact. They had to be just right. I\u2019m not sure how many tracks I recorded, but it was at least a dozen\u2026 maybe 15 or 20. Suddenly, he stopped me, his voice excitedly punching into the headphones I wore: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one!\u201d Five little words, but to satisfy Rich\u2019s inspired mind, they had to be delivered just so.\u000a\u000aOur company offers a small cafeteria in which employees can buy meals and snacks; I\u2019d often see Rich there in the mornings and we\u2019d sit together while I had a bagel and Rich ate\u2026 nothing. Mind you, he\u2019d already been at work for two to three hours by the time I was having my second cup of coffee. It wasn\u2019t the food that drew him; he just liked people and would sit with a couple of his graphic artists and sometimes me, ruminating about the state of the world. He was intensely curious and wanted to know what we thought, whether the topic was politics or real estate or the future of personal computing. I\u2019ve not known anyone\u2014especially someone charged with running a department at a major TV news operation\u2014who could be so upbeat every day. I might grouse about this event or that leader, but not Rich. The world seemed like one big wonderland to him, something to try to capture with his beloved camera and share with the rest of us.\u000a\u000aIf you really wanted to see his face light up, you\u2019d ask him about his family. He adored his wife Karen and their children, Katie and Connor. Now they\u2019ve lost a husband and father, and the rest of us have lost a really good guy and a creative genius. The people who worked for him loved him\u2014he gave a start, a first job, to dozens of animators and graphic artists.\u000a\u000aPeople ask me what happened and I know precious little. There was a bad car accident, some internal injuries that went undetected, then a coma and ultimately, death. It all happened so suddenly. At least Rich\u2019s family\u2014the family he loved so much\u2014was able to be with him to say goodbye when he passed away just a week shy of his 61st birthday. That\u2019s a gift, albeit a painful one, that many of us aren\u2019t able to experience.\u000a\u000aSo now I see him sitting at some breakfast table in heaven, wondering why we\u2019re all so downcast. He never seemed to have a bad day in his life and he certainly wouldn\u2019t want us mourning over him. I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019s intrigued by his new environment and is probably asking questions\u2014lots and lots of questions. I\u2019m sure the lighting there is quite good, the color spectrum divine and the landscapes, incomparable. No doubt, Rich is enjoying the look of the place. But knowing him, I suspect he just might have a couple of suggestions\u2026\u000a\u000aJon Scott serves as co-anchor for "Happening Now."

Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches.

Boyden Gray, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation morph into an open-ended inquisition? Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations. Nor is there an obvious limit on their scope.

The woman told investigators Keating punched her in the face and threw her against a wall. Her injuries included a swollen nose, a black eye and a split lip. Deputies observed no injuries on Keating.\u000a\u000aKeating, 45 and a 14-year veteran of the department, told deputies the woman "flew into a drunken rage" and started hitting him because he won't divorce his wife.\u000a\u000aHe also told deputies the woman "has a history of making false reports against him," and injured herself in the past to support those claims.\u000a\u000aThe Orlando Sentinel cites a 2016 internal investigation following a beating that sent the woman to a hospital in Brevard County with cuts to her face, arms and hands.\u000a\u000aThe report said the woman didn't want to give deputies her boyfriend's name at first, saying she's "terrified he would kill her."\u000a\u000aIn the July 2016 case, the woman said she'd gone to dinner with Keating and when they returned to her apartment, he started screaming at her for no reason and punched her. She told detectives she couldn't breathe and tried to fight him off, but he twisted her arm and punched her again. She told deputies she was "scared of him and scared for her life."\u000a\u000aHowever, she changed her story later, telling detectives she was to blame and "had been a handful that night." She said she didn't want them to investigate. But they continued and forwarded their findings to the Seminole-Brevard State Attorney's Office, which filed charges against Keating. However, Osceola County sheriff Russ Gibson said the woman wouldn't cooperate, so the case wasn't prosecuted and Keating was never arrested.\u000a\u000aDuring an internal investigation, the sheriff's office found the couple has a "volatile" relationship. Deputies were called numerous times including in December when she was accused of taking a golf club to his motorcycle. Investigators noted the conduct reflected poorly on Keating and the sheriff's office.\u000a\u000aKeating was suspended for 24 hours then, but he kept his job. After Saturday's arrest, he's on unpaid administrative leave pending the investigation.

Suddenly his school -- along with many others across the United States -- is under attack. Gunmen burst in, slaughtering children and adults alike.\u000a\u000aFrom the ISIS leader in Syria, to the murderous rampages throughout the U.S., Day of Wrath reveals with chilling effect how national panic and paralyzing terror at the spiraling violence can bring a mighty country to a near-standstill.

Yet, preventing puberty could commit those young people to journeys ending in castration or double mastectomy, when their journeys may have ended in being entirely content with their anatomy at birth.\u000a\u000aWhether one believes that transgender treatment in adults is defensible or not, I believe that sensible people must speak out against those individuals and organizations (including schools) who seem hell-bent on getting the word out to children and adolescents that they may be locked in the wrong bodies.\u000a\u000aThis is happening all over America, and not just with Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aJust this year, for example, Pingree School in Hamilton, Massachusetts, assembled its adolescent and teenaged students for a speech by an individual who had been female and had transitioned to being \u201cmale.\u201d The individual instructed all the students to close their eyes and imagine which gender they really were.\u000a\u000aNo one knows the effect of telling young people like the students at Pingree, many of whom were just then experiencing puberty, that they should consider whether their genitals ought be the opposite ones.\u000a\u000aMany organizations and individuals are abandoning science and common sense because they are convinced they can help children and adolescents by telling them that their gender may not correspond with their anatomy.\u000a\u000aAs a psychiatrist, I believe it is far more likely that they are harming those children and adolescents.\u000a\u000aDr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.

Boyden Gray, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation morph into an open-ended inquisition? Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations.

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages.

aVSomeone brought a dog to mass at my parish this weekend. It lay smack in the middle of the main aisle, forcing parishioners to edge around it. No one said anything, but the symbolism was not lost on some in attendance: dogs may be going to church, but the universal Roman Catholic Church is going to the dogs.\u000a\u000aUnder Pope Francis, the church has abandoned many of its bedrock positions on issues like divorce and homosexuality in favor of a \u201cwhy not?\u201d attitude. Francis has scolded people for being rich, sided with illegal immigrants, and suggested the church should be a refuge for the poor.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aHe has sidelined conservative cardinals, installed like-minded allies in key jobs, taken personal control of the Knights of Malta for defying him, and generally sent the signal that behind his amiable smile and humble talk lurks a radically liberal agenda.\u000a\u000aThe latest example of the pope\u2019s blueprint for the future is contained in an article penned by two of his closest confidantes. They believe that conservative Catholics in the United States have formed a coalition with Evangelical Protestants to push Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, which the authors call a \u201cManichean vision.\u201d The article, in the Jesuit publication La Civiltà Cattolica, could not have been printed without Francis\u2019s knowledge and approval.\u000a\u000aThe pope left little doubt about his feelings toward Trump when the president and first lady visited the Vatican earlier this year. In their joint photo, Francis frowns as if he smelled something bad in the room.\u000a\u000aIn addition to rejecting Trump\u2019s worldview, the article\u2019s authors single out White House strategist Stephen Bannon as a \u201csupporter of apocalyptic geopolitics.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pope is expressing his displeasure at the election of Donald Trump as president and with the Catholics who voted for him,\u201d says Deal Hudson, former Catholic Outreach director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt came as a huge surprise to the establishment of the church, who were pulling for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, says Hudson, the pope is wielding his power as CEO of the Church to tell American Catholics \u201cwe are bad Christians. This was his way of calling us a basket of deplorables without using that phrase.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis pope does not like the culture war,\u201d says Robert Royal, president of the Faith and Reason Institute and a commentator on the Catholic network EWTN. \u201cThe real tragedy is they\u2019re trying to discredit some types of religious action in the public square, while they are very active in advocating for the environment, immigrants and stopping human trafficking.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrancis can run the church any way he wants. But demonizing conservative American Catholics is a risky business.

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data. If the sensor detects dangerous levels of radon for longer than 48 hours, it notifies the user and recommends what to do next. The sensor also gives audio alerts.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aIf high levels of radon are detected, experts recommend getting in touch immediately with a contractor who can implement a radon reduction system that will reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. It will set you back around $800-$1,200 \u2014 or more if the home has crawl spaces, no gravel under the slab or a completely finished lower level.\u000a\u000a\u201cEach state radon or radiation department should have a list of qualified contractors,\u201d Brodhead said. \u201cIt is usually best to have a local qualified contractor do the work to get better service.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrodhead recommends hiring a contractor who visits your home before submitting an estimate. He also advises getting more than one estimate and checking with references.

aVWith few good options available to deal with the growing threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, the Trump administration scored a major victory on Saturday by getting the UN Security Council to unanimously impose the toughest sanctions ever on North Korea in response to its recent ICBM tests.\u000a\u000aBut as important as the new sanctions are, they will have little or no effect unless China fully complies with them and starts playing a much more active role in pressuring Pyongyang to cease its WMD programs and belligerent behavior.\u000a\u000aThe new UN sanctions reportedly will cost North Korean an estimated $1 billion \u2013 a third of its export earnings \u2013 mostly by filling loopholes in UN sanctions imposed last November that only put caps on iron ore and coal sales to China. The new sanctions outright ban iron ore, coal, lead and seafood exports from North Korea and increase banking sanctions as well as sanctions on North Korean persons and entities.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s blunt criticism of China\u2019s inaction and the president\u2019s indications that all options really are on the table may lead Beijing to reevaluate its North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aWhile these may be the toughest UN sanctions ever imposed on North Korea, China and Russia blocked several tougher measures sought by the United States. For example, the United States wanted to cut off Chinese oil exports to North Korea but Moscow and Beijing would not agree. They also blocked stricter banking and commercial penalties. In addition, because of Chinese and Russia opposition, the new sanctions bar North Korea from sending more workers abroad but North Korean laborers already working abroad \u2013 including many in China and Russia \u2013 won\u2019t be sent home. Similarly, only new \u2013 not existing \u2013 foreign investment and joint ventures in North Korea are banned by the sanctions.\u000a\u000aWhile these shortcomings are significant, the main factor that will determine whether the new sanctions succeed is China. Will China cooperate? Will Beijing step up pressure against Pyongyang like it has never done before?\u000a\u000aA major reason prior UN sanctions failed to have the intended effect on North Korea is because China failed to abide by them. China\u2019s trade with North Korea increased in the first quarter of 2017 by 37 percent and its iron ore imports from the North grew by 270 percent despite UN sanctions imposed on the Hermit Kingdom last November. China\u2019s violations of these and other UN sanctions provided Kim Jong Un with billions of dollars in hard currency that he spent on about 84 missiles tests since 2012 \u2013 including 17 in 2017 \u2013 and three increasingly powerful nuclear weapon tests.\u000a\u000aAlthough there have been recent reports that North Korea may have an operational ICBM and an H-bomb within two years, no one outside North Korea (except maybe the Iranians) knows exactly how advanced these programs are. However, Beijing, like the rest of the world, is worried about the rapid progress of these programs and knows they are on a dangerous trajectory that could spark a major war, possibly by miscalculation.\u000a\u000aChina also knows that unlike Barack Obama, who preferred doing nothing about difficult international problems and kick them down the road to the new president, President Trump sees North Korea\u2019s WMD programs and its repeated threats to attack the United States as an intolerable situation that need to be addressed now. Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt criticism of China\u2019s inaction and the president\u2019s indications that all options really are on the table may lead Beijing to reevaluate its North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aAs it has done so many times in the past, China today made the absurd claim that the United States bears some responsibility for tensions with North Korea and that these tensions could be reduced if the U.S. dropped joint military exercises with South Korea and withdrew U.S. troops from the South. But China\u2019s foreign minister also had \u201can intensive conversation\u201d with his North Korean counterpart Monday and publicly warned North Korea to \u201cnot violate the UN\u2019s decision or provoke the international society\u2019s good will by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is a good start that I hope indicates China\u2019s willingness to finally get tough with North Korea and stop violating UN sanctions. If North Korea defies these sanctions, the United States should demand imposing the tougher measures that Moscow and Beijing refused to include in them.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration should follow up with additional sanctions against North Korea outside of the UN and closely monitor sanctions compliance, especially by China. Any Chinese cheating on these measures should result in U.S. sanctions against the Chinese firms and persons responsible. The Trump administration should also continue to develop military options, pressure South Korea to deploy the THAAD missile defense system, and put on more shows of military force in the region.\u000a\u000aThe clock may be ticking down to a military conflict with North Korea. Hopefully Beijing realizes that strong and unambiguous Chinese pressure on Pyongyang may be the only way to prevent this from happening.\u000a\u000aFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVLess than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.\u000a\u000a\u201cNinety percent of the trade that North Korea has is with China. So that\u2019s why they were so important to this resolution,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cChina stepped up and said, we will follow through on these sanctions. And they encouraged the international community to follow it. When that missile test took off, they felt it in China. And they\u2019re disturbed enough to say that they now have to do their part.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aNorth Korea responded Monday with threats and backlash, seemingly suggesting that the dictator Kim Jong Un was doubling down on his objective of developing a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the continental U.S. Haley, however, maintained that \u201cwe are not going to run scared from them.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. SPY SATELLITES DETECT NORTH KOREA MOVING ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILES TO PATROL BOAT\u000a\u000aThe ambassador, who has made global human rights at the forefront of her positions since starting the job earlier this year, also characterized the chaos in Venezuela as \u201ctragic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are watching a democracy go directly into a dictatorship,\u201d Haley said, noting that an emergency hearing on the country in crisis was called two months ago after she proclaimed it a \u201cserious human rights\u201d concern.\u000a\u000aNORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS DESCRIBE CONCENTRATION CAMP, DAILY LIFE\u000a\u000aVenezuela has been in a state of conflict for months, with almost daily anti-government protests targeting iron-fisted President Nicolas Maduro have been engulfing through the increasingly impoverished country.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026.

Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted. Parents can dress up Arlo Baby to look like a rabbit (with snap-on ears and feet) , a Dalmatian, or a cat.\u000a\u000aIt also records video, so busy parents don't have to miss milestones like their baby\u2019s first words or first steps.\u000a\u000a"If one parent is on the road, you can use your smartphone and get access to a live feed from the camera, and type in your password to get into the app and see what baby's doing at any time of the day," Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aUsers can talk to their babies when they\u2019re away, thanks to the monitor\u2019s two-way audio.

aVBefore Jerry Mathers found fame as Theodore \u201cBeaver\u201d Cleaver in the wholesome sitcom \u201cLeave It to Beaver,\u201d he was personally selected by Alfred Hitchcock to star in 1995 dark comedy \u201cThe Trouble with Harry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI arrived at the audition and at that point he had probably seen everyone in Los Angeles for the part,\u201d the 69-year-old former child actor told Fox News. \u201cI walked into the interview and he seemed very nice. In fact, the first time I met him, he was sitting behind this huge desk and he had all of this food in front of him.\u000a\u000a"I hadn\u2019t had lunch because my mom told me we would have some after the audition. I was looking at all of this food and he said, \u2018Hello Mr. Mathers.\u2019 I was a bit shocked. Then he said, \u2018How are you doing? I\u2019m thinking about making a movie.\u2019 We talked for a little bit and he said, \u2018We\u2019ll be going someplace, do you like to travel?\u2019 This guy seemed very nice!\u201d\u000a\u000aHitchcock, the brooding British filmmaker who earned the nicknamed \u201cthe master of suspense\u201d for his psychological thrillers involving such as \u201cPsycho,\u201d \u201cThe Birds,\u201d and \u201cVertigo," appeared friendly and approachable to then-7-year-old Mathers.\u000a\u000a\u201cI really got to know him when we went to Stowe, Vermont,\u201d said Mathers. \u201cWhenever we had lunch there, and we were on location 12-14 weeks, all the local women would cook us lunch for the whole crew.\u000a\u000a"And each would bring out their best dishes every day. And whenever we had lunch, Mr. Hitchcock was the first one to examine the dishes\u2026 I would just follow him and go, \u2018Oh, was that a good one, Mr. Hitchcock?\u2019 And he would go, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s the one I\u2019m going to have.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA post shared by Matt Berman (@mrmattberman) on Jul 3, 2017 at 11:47am PDT\u000a\u000aMathers said he wouldn\u2019t really consider Hitchcock a friend due to their significant age differences. However, the director somehow always made his presence known when Mathers, then 9-years-old, would go on to appear in \u201cLeave It to Beaver.\u201d That was 1957, which was two years after he launched his own series, titled \u201cAlfred Hitchcock Presents.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c[He] was about three stages down [in the same studio]," Mathers recalled. \u201cBut he only came in once a month [to] do all the intros... I would see him when I had a little free time and he would roll in a big Rolls Royce with a chauffeur... He would go, \u2018How are you doing today? How\u2019s the show going?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aIt wouldn\u2019t be the last time the two would cross paths in Hollywood. For the 1960 film \u201cPsycho,\u201d Mathers helped makeup supervisor Robert Dawn, who also worked on \u201cLeave It to Beaver,\u201d create the special effects for Mrs. Bates\u2019 skull used in the final scenes of the movie.\u000a\u000a\u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d ran from 1957 until 1963. Mathers told Fox News in July he currently leads lectures across the country to raise awareness on Type 2 diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in 1997.\u000a\u000aHitchcock died at age 80 in 1980 from kidney failure.

aVNot that long ago, you might have heard about an alarming concern with deodorant. People warned their friends through email and social media that these necessary antiperspirants cause breast cancer. Actually, some people even stopped using deodorant before this threat, such as Cameron Diaz who hasn\u2019t worn it in years! Before ditching your deodorant, though, you should understand the full story behind the concerns about deodorant and breast cancer.\u000a\u000aFirst, many people have worries about drugstore deodorants because of parabens. Recently, scientists performed a study which was published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology. The researchers took four samples of breast tissue from 40 women who had cancer. They found an interesting result.\u000a\u000aAfter analyzing the tissue, they found parabens in as many as 99 percent of the tissue samples. Even further, the scientists detected at least 5 parabens in 60 percent of the samples. In addition, some patients did experience breast cancer that formed in the armpit area while others did not.\u000a\u000aGETTING READY FOR COLLEGE? CONSIDER THESE VACCINES\u000a\u000aWith results such as these, you can see why both scientists and consumers are showing uncertainty. At the same time, this study doesn\u2019t clearly link the parabens as a cause of the breast cancer.\u000a\u000aSince the women experienced cancer in several locations, there also was no evidence that cancer resulted from paraben-containing deodorants. However, the results do warrant more research by scientists and health professionals.\u000a\u000aParabens: What Are They?\u000a\u000aEssentially, parabens are synthetic ingredients used in many personal care products and even foods. Companies favor them because parabens come with a low cost and act as a preservative that protects against mold and bacterial growth.\u000a\u000aBecause parabens can be absorbed through the skin, however, these ingredients can easily get into a person\u2019s bloodstream. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, researchers have found parabens in up to 99 percent of people in the US. Also, Scientific American states that up to 90 percent of common grocery products contain parabens, making it a hard synthetic to avoid.\u000a\u000aThe major reason for concern with these common ingredients is that parabens showcase weak estrogen-like qualities. Unbalanced levels of estrogen have shown to play a role in cancer, and parabens themselves may further cancer growth.\u000a\u000aIn one study, however, scientists actually grew breast cancer cells in a lab. Then, they combined parabens with another chemical to study the cancer\u2019s reaction.\u000a\u000aThey found that the cancer did indeed grow with the combined effect of parabens and another chemical. While the research does prove that parabens can fuel the growth of cancer under the right conditions, it still does not directly link them as a carcinogen.\u000a\u000aIS LIPOSUCTION SAFE FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES?\u000a\u000aIn defense, many health experts contend that the level of parabens in food and beauty products is too low to directly cause cancer. Furthermore, the research does not show that paraben-containing deodorants can increase the risk for breast cancer.\u000a\u000aHow You Should Respond\u000a\u000aSo what should you take away from this research? Consider this:\u000a\u000aIf you have no other concerns about using drugstore deodorant, you do not need to toss out your usual brand. People have been using paraben-containing deodorants for decades with no known damaging health effects.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, you could choose to avoid knowingly buying products with parabens as a safety net. One doctor from the Lankenau Medical Center in Pennsylvania, Marisa Weiss, MD, figures that it won\u2019t hurt anything to stay on the safe side. Weiss personally avoids products with parabens, keeping her products as natural as possible.\u000a\u000aWhile parabens are undergoing some scrutiny lately, studies have not found a direct link to the low levels of parabens in deodorant and breast cancer. In fact, many deodorants have stopped using parabens as an ingredient, reducing the cause for concern anyway. If you still have uncertainties, you can choose more natural deodorants to stay on the safe side.\u000a\u000aDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor. He also serves as chairman of the department of obstetrics/gynecology and reproductive science at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.

aVAn anonymous note accusing Google of embracing diversity while chilling intellectual freedom has unleashed a flood of divergent opinions and proves not everyone inside the tech giant toes the company line.\u000a\u000aThe 10-page memo, written by a male engineer and widely shared internally, was eventually leaked to Gizmodo. In it, the author slams the tech giant\u2019s \u201cleft bias\u201d for having created a \u201cpolitically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe engineer, who has not been identified publicly, argues that gender disparities in Google\u2019s workforce can be explained by biological differences between men and women. The memo asserts Google should replace its existing diversity efforts with policies to allow for more \u201cideological diversity.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a recent annual report the company made public, 69% of Google\u2019s employees were revealed as male and 55% of its employees were white.\u000a\u000aReaction to the memo, pro and con, has been vehement.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom what I've seen it's been a mix of women saying, 'This is terrible and it's been distracting me from my work and it shouldn't be allowed;' Men and women saying 'this is horrible but we need to let him have a voice;' and men saying 'This is so brave, I agree,'\u201d one current Google employee told Motherboard.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s VP for Diversity, Integrity and Governance, Danielle Brown, swiftly rebuked the anonymous engineer\u2019s memo:\u000a\u000a\u201cMany of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our engineering organization, expressing views on the natural abilities and characteristics of different genders, as well as whether one can speak freely of these things at Google. And like many of you, I found that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I'm not going to link to it here as it's not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to Motherboard, some employees wrote messages of support for the memo\u2019s author, including this one:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fella who posted that is extremely brave. We need more people standing up against the insanity. Otherwise 'Diversity and Inclusion' which is essentially a pipeline from Women's and African Studies into Google, will ruin the company," another comment in the thread said.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s diversity chief also addressed Google\u2019s perceived lack of ideological diversity:\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cPart of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe memo also led a range of current and former tech employees to tweet, pen their own essays and call out the engineer who wrote it.\u000a\u000aChristopher Carbone is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history.

Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations.

aVWhite House officials have been urging President Trump to double down on the platform that got him elected into the nation\u2019s highest office, while he tries to re-energize his staunchest allies.\u000a\u000aAdvisers have been urging Trump to refocus on immigration and other issues that resonate with the conservatives, evangelicals and working-class whites who propelled him to the Oval Office.\u000a\u000aThe president has also ramped up his media-bashing through Twitter, long a successful tactic for Trump, and staged rallies hoping to marshal his base to his defense. On Monday, he used the tactic to take swipes at Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., after he expressed support for a special counsel\u2019s probe of Trump\u2019s associates\u2019 links to Russia.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s advisers are aware that a serious slip in support among his core voters could jeopardize hopes for a major, early legislative accomplishment and would certainly increase Republicans' worries about his re-election prospects.\u000a\u000aThe president's struggles already have prompted public speculation about his political future. The White House pushed back angrily Sunday against a New York Times report about Republicans preparing for 2020 presidential race that may not include Trump. The report described Vice President Mike Pence as laying groundwork in case Trump does not run. Pence called the report "disgraceful."\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe chatter has been fueled by Trump's unsuccessful attempt to shepherd health care legislation through Congress, the drip-drip of revelations about his associates' ties to Russia and the churn of turnover and turmoil at the White House. The president's advisers have tried to drown out the bad news by focusing on his agenda.\u000a\u000a"They are telling him just enact your program," Conway said of the president's base in a recent interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cDon't worry about a Congress that isn't supporting legislation to get big ticket items done. And don't worry about all the distractions and diversions and discouragement that others, who are trying to throw logs in your path, are throwing your way."\u000a\u000aImmigration is expected to continue being a focus for Trump in the coming weeks, including a push for the border wall. Officials also are weighing a more public role for White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, a favorite of Trump backers whose hardline immigration policies irritate some congressional Republicans.\u000a\u000aThe appointment of White House chief of staff John Kelly also fits in to that effort. While Kelly was brought in primarily to bring much-needed discipline to the West Wing, officials note that he, too, is viewed favorably by some Trump loyalists for his early execution of the administration's immigration policy as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Kelly's appointment was particularly welcomed by senior strategist Steve Bannon, who has taken on the task of ensuring Trump doesn't drift from the promises he made to his base during the campaign.\u000a\u000aAlice Stewart, a conservative who worked for the presidential campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said Trump is right to make overtures toward his coalition of loyal supporters, even if some of his moves are incomplete.\u000a\u000a"I think people realize half a loaf is better than none," Stewart said.\u000a\u000aMitch Harper, a former GOP state legislator and Republican activist in Indiana, said Trump will get credit from conservatives even for partial measures simply because he is "articulating things that they have not heard anyone articulate in a long time."\u000a\u000aAnd what about the results? Harper said Trump supporters "are willing to wait."\u000a\u000aIndeed, even some of Trump's advisers still marvel at the loyalty of the president's supporters. For now, conservatives are pinning the blame on Washington's failure to get health care done not on Trump, but on the handful of Republican senators who blocked legislation aimed at overhauling "Obamacare."\u000a\u000a"I think on health care the president is viewed as someone who did everything they could," said Matt Schlapp, who heads the American Conservative Union.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVBy Kaitlyn Schallhorn\u000a\u000aPublished July 20, 2017 | Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aO.J. Simpson could be a free man as early as October.\u000a\u000aThe disgraced former football star \u2013 born Orenthal James Simpson \u2013 will face a parole board today that will decide whether Simpson should be released from prison as early as Oct. 1, according to state parole officials.\u000a\u000aSimpson, 70, was found guilty in 2008 of armed robbery, kidnapping and other charges stemming from a confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas casino hotel room. The altercation occurred in September 2007.\u000a\u000aSimpson has already served eight years of his 9- to 33-year sentence.\u000a\u000aNo one is expected to testify against Simpson at the hearing, where all four members of the parole board must be in agreement for Simpson\u2019s early release.\u000a\u000aRead on to find out more about Simpson\u2019s case.\u000a\u000aWhat was he sentenced for?\u000a\u000aSimpson was convicted in 2008 of kidnapping and armed robbery along with 10 other charges. Prosecutors said the Hall of Famer, along with five other men, stormed into a hotel room and took memorabilia such as game balls, photos and plaques.\u000a\u000aFour co-defendants pleaded guilty before the trial to felony charges and testified for the prosecution. Two told jurors they brought and displayed guns, although Simpson insisted he never knew anyone was armed.

aVBy Frank Miniter, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aAn IT scandal involving perhaps dozens of Democrats in Congress is advancing so fast that it can be hard to keep up with the details \u2013 especially given that so much of the media is ignoring or downplaying the story.\u000a\u000aThe story exploded last week when congressional IT staffer Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington as he was about to fly to Pakistan. Awan, who was employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-Fla.), was charged with bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty. But the story only begins with alleged bank fraud.\u000a\u000aHere are 10 shocking things we know right now about the scandal.\u000a\u000a1. Awan was arrested after wiring $283,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to Pakistan. Officials charged him with defrauding the credit union of $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application.

aVBy Dr. Keith Ablow | Fox News\u000a\u000aNew Planned Parenthood guidelines for parents now advise that children as young as four years old be informed that having a penis or a vagina doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are male or female. Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches. Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.

aVBy Steve Cortes | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe song Chicago, made famous by Old Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, refers to Chicago as a \u201ctoddlin\u2019 town.\u201d Sadly today, thanks to decades of dreadful leadership, Chicago more resembles a \u201ctottering\u201d town, as in a place nearing collapse.\u000a\u000aLet me preface my indictment of Chicago and particularly Mayor Rahm Emanuel with the important disclaimer that I love this city and I\u2019ve raised a family here for two decades. If cut, I would bleed the orange and navy of the Monsters of the Midway, my beloved Chicago Bears.\u000a\u000aBut no amount of hometown affinity can color the reality of a city in systemic decline. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that from 2015 to 2016, Cook County \u2013 where Chicago is located \u2013 lost more people than any county in America. A U-Haul rental from Chicago to Texas can cost as much as six times more than the return trip, an indicator of the heavy outward flow of people. It\u2019s no wonder people vote with their feet and escape the endemic corruption, escalating taxes, and rampant crime. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly on Fox News, Chicago is certainly the most dangerous place in the developed world, with over 2,200 shooting already this year.\u000a\u000aSo what is Mayor Emanuel doing to address this migration out of our city? How is he ameliorating the mammoth $838 million property tax increase that\u2019s crushing disposable incomes in our city? Is he searching for solutions for the most under-funded pension system in America, obligations that will cripple our budget in just a few years? Is Rahm empowering police to stem the bloody carnage that afflicts the streets, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods?

aVTry as they might, the infection control specialists at Royal Brompton Hospital could not eradicate the invasive fungus that was attacking already gravely ill patients in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aEnhanced cleaning didn\u2019t stop the dangerous bug from spreading from one patient to the next in the 296-bed hospital. Neither did segregating infected patients, to keep them from spreading the fungus.\u000a\u000aEventually, officials who run the Royal Brompton, located a couple of miles from Buckingham Palace in London\u2019s tony Chelsea neighborhood, resorted to a last-ditch move no hospital ever wants to have to take. They temporarily shut their ICU. That appears to have put a stop to the more than year-long outbreak, which ended last year and which involved at least 50 patients.\u000a\u000aThe lengths to which the Royal Brompton was forced to resort to rid the hospital of Candida auris \u2014 a member of a broader fungal family named Candida \u2014 raised red flags for the small community of scientists who study fungi that infect people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey did the Cadillac of drastic actions to make that happen, which we generally wouldn\u2019t be doing for Candidal infections,\u201d Dr. Tom Chiller, the chief of mycotic \u2014 fungal \u2014 diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT in a recent interview.\u000a\u000aBACK TO SCHOOL: HOW TO AVOID SCABIES INFECTION IN CHILDREN\u000a\u000aThe fear is that that\u2019s what U.S. hospitals may be facing if C. auris breaches their infection control defenses. Last year at this time, the CDC knew of a single U.S. case, which occurred in 2013. As of mid-July, the case count had risen to 98 in nine states, though the lion\u2019s share have been reported by two \u2014 New York (68) and neighboring New Jersey (20).\u000a\u000aOn the ever-growing list of bad bugs, C. auris is one of the most unsettling. Dr. Anne Schuchat, who served as the CDC\u2019s acting director this spring, termed it a \u201ccatastrophic threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aSaid Chiller: \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for really sick people right now and we at CDC are taking a very aggressive approach to see if we can\u2019t control, contain, and even eradicate it from the places it exists.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut doing that won\u2019t be easy.\u000a\u000aMost fungal infections are acquired when a person picks up the fungus from the environment. But it seems C. auris can be transmitted from person to person, at least in a hospital setting. The fungus is hellishly difficult to eradicate from a space, once it settles in. And some versions of it seem to be impervious to the drugs \u2014 the dismayingly few drugs, it must be noted \u2014 that combat fungal infections.\u000a\u000aMore on this... She's got a radical approach for the age of superbugs: Don't fight infections. Learn to live with them external-ct\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s almost a perfect storm kind of organism. It has all the bad characteristics of a large number of bad pathogens,\u201d said Dr. Alex Kallen, a medical officer with the division of health care quality promotion at the CDC.\u000a\u000aThe resistant strains of the fungus seem to be as robust as the non-resistant strains \u2014 which is a disappointment and a concern. Often organisms that develop resistance pay a price; they are weakened in the process and don\u2019t spread as well. But with this fungus there is no \u201cfitness\u201d tradeoff for acquiring resistance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s again another scary thing about it. Because we don\u2019t want fit resistant organisms,\u201d Chiller said.\u000a\u000aNone of these dire characteristics was apparent when the fungus was first detected, in 2009. Then it was simply a new fungus grown from discharge swabbed out of the ear of a 70-year-old woman in a Japanese hospital.\u000a\u000aFinding new additions to the fungal family tree is not uncommon; nor is it considered alarming, generally speaking.\u000a\u000aBut then the radar pinged again. Some scientists in Pakistan were investigating puzzling bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients that they thought were caused by another type of yeast, called Saccharomyces. They shipped samples to Atlanta in the hopes the CDC could help. The culprit was actually C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat caught our attention,\u201d Chiller admitted. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019re like, \u2018Huh? Candida auris? A cluster that big in a hospital?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aOther countries started reporting cases. In fairly short order after the Japanese report, countries on three continents disclosed having seen infections caused by this fungus.\u000a\u000aThe widespread and virtually simultaneous appearances of C. auris raised suspicions that travelers were moving the fungus around \u2014 but that turned out not to be accurate. Comparing genetic sequences from various places showed different strains in each place \u2014 a phenomenon that remains a bit of a mystery. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s one thing,\u201d said Kallen, when asked how to explain the dissemination of the fungus.\u000a\u000aTo be clear, C. auris isn\u2019t the zombie apocalypse. Healthy people aren\u2019t going to be felled in the street by this fungus.\u000a\u000aIn fact, like lots of other pathogens, some of us carry Candida fungi on our skin \u2014 C. auris seems to especially like the warmth of armpits and the groin. As is true with other bugs, this fungus doesn\u2019t generally cause problems when it\u2019s on the outside of a healthy person being kept in check by other bugs with which it shares human turf.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s when someone gets sick that C. auris can become a problem. The fungus can infiltrate the bloodstream \u2014 wending its way into the body along a catheter or an intravenous line used to deliver fluids and medicines. When that happens, sick people become a lot sicker.\u000a\u000aWHAT IS 'LEAKY GUT' -- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT?\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that about five or six out of every 10 people that have been seen to be infected with C. auris die. Chiller cautioned, though, one cannot say the fungus kills 50 percent or 60 percent of its victims. As often is the case with secondary infections \u2014 bugs that infect people who are already fighting off another serious ailment \u2014 it can be tough to determine who died \u201cfrom\u201d the fungus, and in whom the infection merely contributed to the death.\u000a\u000aKeeping C. auris from getting into and spreading within hospitals is the big goal here. But it\u2019s likely to prove challenging. At the Royal Brompton, in London, doctors found that when a patient with C. auris was moved out of a hospital room, the next patient to move in would pick up the fungus. Even after cleaning, the fungus could be found on multiple surfaces \u2014 the bed, the floor \u2014 in the room.\u000a\u000aThe team of researchers there who investigated the outbreak declined requests for interviews.\u000a\u000aDr. Curtis Donskey, chief of infectious diseases at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, has been studying C. auris in the laboratory, trying to determine how long it can survive on surfaces in hospitals and which cleaning regimens can effectively destroy it.\u000a\u000aIn an upcoming paper, he and colleagues will report that the disinfectants most commonly used in U.S. hospitals are not that effective against this fungus.\u000a\u000aThey also found that C. auris is able to live on surfaces for at least seven days. And that is probably not the end of the C. auris story. \u201cWe certainly suspect that they would last longer than that,\u201d Donskey said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how long we tested.\u201d\u000a\u000aAware of this problem, the CDC has recommended hospitals use bleach to clean rooms that housed patients with C. auris. But that\u2019s not a fail-safe solution. \u201cWe found more of it on moist surfaces that are not typically cleaned with bleach at all,\u201d said Donskey, pointing to sink drains.\u000a\u000aAnd bleach isn\u2019t the easiest of cleaning regimens. \u201cIt\u2019s damaging, it doesn\u2019t smell good, causes occupational health issues,\u201d CDC\u2019s Kallen said.\u000a\u000aLikewise, there are surfaces hospitals might not think to clean between every patient that can harbor the bacteria \u2014 for instance, the privacy curtains that separate patients in a multi-bed room.\u000a\u000aAdopting the enhanced cleaning techniques used to control C. difficile \u2014 a bacteria that forms a spore and is also challenging to control \u2014 should help with C. auris, said Donskey.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s hoping, though, that the lessons hospitals learned as they battled that bacteria \u2014 for example, clean those privacy curtains after a patient with C. difficile is moved out of a room \u2014 will give them a head start in the era of C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the environment is much more appreciated now than it was a decade ago as a source for transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we would do the same things if we see Candida auris that we already are very well used to for trying to control C. diff and other pathogens.\u201d

aVGoogle has fired the author of a controversial anti-diversity manifesto that got leaked to the media this weekend after circulating among employees last week, according to multiple reports. CEO Sundar Pichai publicly spoke out against the memo Tuesday night, and also said that he would cut his family vacation short to deal with the crisis.\u000a\u000aBloomberg was first to get a confirmation for the firing from the affected employee; Google declined to confirm the termination when contacted by Variety.\u000a\u000aThe ten-page manifesto, titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber,\u201d accused the company of a left-wing political bias that led to the discrimination of male employees under the guise of diversity. Throughout the text, it aimed to defend the idea that women supposedly have inherent biological traits that make it harder for them to succeed in engineering positions at a tech company like Google.\u000a\u000aThe author went on to stereotype women as more susceptible to \u201cneuroticism,\u201d and suggested that hiring practices that account for diversity would lower the bar, effectively resulting in the hire of less qualified applicants.\u000a\u000aGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in a memo sent to staff Tuesday night that he valued critical discussions of Google\u2019s diversity programs, but added that some of the accusations made in the memo were clearly harmful to other employees.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d he wrote in the memo, which the company published on its blog. \u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.\u201d\u000a\u000aPichai had been spending time in Africa and Europe recently, and had started his family vacation overseas this week. But in light of the controversy, he decided to return to the office early.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to discuss as a group\u2014including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.\u201c

There\u2019s a Federation ship under attack by Klingons, and the Discovery is rushing to join their fight. \u201cLock on the Bird of Prey!\u201d Lorca barks. \u201cBasic pattern Beta 9. Hard to port!

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.\u000a\u000aIf history tells us anything, China has never, ever, enforced UN Security Council resolutions when it comes to North Korea.\u000a\u000aIt seems, at least for the time being, the Trump administration has decided to follow the most obvious path of trying to restrain North Korea, attacking the lifeblood of the Kim regime: its exports to the outside world. Over the weekend, the U.S. led an international coalition passing a tough UN Security Council resolution that one senior White House official described to me as \u201csanctions on Hulk Hogan-style steroids.\u201d\u000a\u000aYikes.\u000a\u000aOn the surface, the sanctions do seem quite muscular. The move, supported by China as well as Russia, take away roughly one-third of North Korea\u2019s export revenue, or a billion dollars, from an economy that is roughly worth only fourteen billion. Considering the fact that Pyongyang\u2019s economy is the size of tiny Laos, this has all the appearances of a devastating response to North Korea\u2019s two recent long-range missile tests.\u000a\u000aExcept it\u2019s not. You see, there is a fatal flaw when it comes to applying sanctions to North Korea: almost all of Pyongyang\u2019s exports go to its Communist brother-in-arms, China. And if history tells us anything, China has never, ever, enforced UN Security Council resolutions when it comes to North Korea. In fact, it seems quite clear this latest sanctions action will be what all the other sanctions resolutions end up being: a scrap of worthless paper.\u000a\u000aThe simple fact is Beijing is likely more afraid of North Korea than we are. Senior Chinese officials have told me time and time again they fear that if they put too much pressure on the Kim regime it could collapse\u2014and they would own the problems that would create. As one Chinese official told me last week: \u201cThe great rule we learned from you [the United States] when it comes to international politics is that if you break it, you own it. We aren\u2019t going to risk collapsing the North Korean regime. We don\u2019t want to deal with that nightmare. We will apply pressure, but you will never be happy with how far we are willing to go.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom there\u2014at least the way Beijing sees it\u2014it could get even worse. China also fears creating a situation where if North Korea were to collapse there could be a civil war, where rival factions fire atomic or chemical weapons at each other\u2014and millions would likely perish. They also don't want countless scores of refugees to feed or, at some point in the future, a united Korea that is allied with America that would be a powerful counterweight to Beijing.\u000a\u000aFor China, a divided Korea, even as dangerous as it is, suits their interests in some respects. We aren\u2019t talking much about the South China Sea or Taiwan, for instance, so Beijing does gain an important advantage on other issues if North Korea takes up all the foreign policy bandwidth in Asia.\u000a\u000aDespite these challenges, which I would argue are inflated from China\u2019s point of view\u2014Beijing could easily offer alternative options to help the international community push back against a common threat, like getting Kim to the negotiating table\u2014China\u2019s strategy seems quite clear. Beijing wants to ensure the status quo holds for at least the short- to medium-term.\u000a\u000aThankfully there is still time to make some important course corrections to see these sanction actions constrain North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang simply can\u2019t be allowed to continue building more and more advanced nuclear weapons and missiles. Sanctions are the best of the worst options\u2014and they need to be enforced, unless China wants to offer a better idea.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump should use his Twitter feed and tell the world Beijing has 30 days to comply with UN sanctions on North Korea\u2014or else. He should declare: \u201cChina, I am watching your actions on North Korea\u2014keep your word on the sanctions. The world is watching.\u201d If Beijing does not, he should name and shame on his Twitter feed any Chinese entity that is helping North Korea evade the sanctions.\u000a\u000aThen, he should impose unilateral sanctions on those firms, such as stopping them from using the U.S. financial system or doing any business here in America\u2014possibly sanctioning large Chinese banks or state-owned enterprises. Then, Team Trump needs to press forward on making sure China plays by the rules on trade, pushing back in the South China Sea or over Taiwan, or wherever else Beijing is pressing its luck. That might be just the only way to get China to keep its word.\u000a\u000aHarry J.

Many of them are dedicated to home security, including smart locks like Dwelo and Kevo, which allow users to unlock their homes via voice command even when they\u2019re not near the door. Others, such as August Smart Lock, will lock the door too, when you tell Alexa your pin code. Amazon Echo also connects to home security systems such as Scout, Alarm.com and SimpliSafe.

And now there\u2019s a new addition: the Echo Show ($229.99), which has a 7-inch screen that plays media, can be used for video calls and adds a visual element to Alexa-controlled home security. Ask Alexa to show you the front door or a child\u2019s bedroom, and Echo Show pulls up a live feed from a camera. \u201cWe use Echo Show at my home to make sure we understand who is coming in and out of the house,\u201d said Rausch.\u000a\u000aCurrently the Echo Show only works with home security cameras such as Arlo by NETGEAR and Ring video doorbells, but Amazon is adding to the list.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe see Alexa as the great simplifier in the home,\u201d said Rausch. \u201cYou can ask Alexa, \u2018Is my door locked?

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis | Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVIf it weren\u2019t for his daughter, Ronald Ro, a San Francisco-based engineer, might still be working for Boeing or Samsung. And if it weren\u2019t for her dad, 6-year-old Jungsuh might still be struggling with her eczema.\u000a\u000aSeven years ago, Ro and his friend Kevin Cho, who has two sons with asthma, were frustrated with the air monitors on the market and set out to design a better one. In 2015 they launched Awair.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, the $199 Awair, with its minimalistic display and North American walnut case, looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired alarm clock. It gives you the time, but when you double-tap on the monitor, it displays the air quality scores in the room. There\u2019s also the $179 Awair Baby, designed for nurseries in Ocean blue or Baby Rose. The final product in the line, Awair Glow ($109), plugs directly into an outlet and could easily be mistaken for a nightlight made by Apple.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000a\u201cJust because there is technology within our products doesn\u2019t mean they need to look like technology,\u201d says Ro, who became Awair\u2019s CEO.\u000a\u000aBut what really distinguishes Awair from other air monitors is its empowerment capabilities.\u000a\u000aAccording to the American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air 2017 report, more than 40 percent of Americans \u2014 more than 125 million people \u2014 live in counties that have unhealthful levels of ozone or particle pollution. Dirty air exacerbated Ro\u2019s daughter\u2019s eczema and Cho\u2019s sons\u2019 asthma; it\u2019s the archenemy of people with allergies and chemical sensitivities; and it\u2019s been linked to sleeping problems and even death. According to 2014 World Health Organization estimates, polluted air is the cause of one out of every eight deaths in the world.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aIndoor air can be five times as polluted as outdoor air, according to Awair, and people \u2014 whether they\u2019re in a hotel room that\u2019s been cleaned with harsh chemicals \u2026 or in a packed and poorly ventilated meeting room with rising levels of carbon dioxide \u2026 or in an older home with low-quality paint and carpeting that leaks chemicals into the air \u2014 often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re inhaling toxins.\u000a\u000aAwair monitors the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, chemicals and dust in a room, and when any of them reach unhealthy levels \u2014 indicated by a color code on the display \u2014 it notifies an app that recommends solutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe always jokingly say in the office, \u2018The only people who need Awair are those who breathe air,\u2019\u201d says Ro. \u201cMany people don\u2019t think about air because they don\u2019t see it, but the fact is that we wouldn\u2019t drink dirty water, but so many of us breathe dirty air.\u201d\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aThe Awair app also provides tips and recommended courses of action from the Mayo Clinic. For example, it may suggest placing a peace lily, which removes airborne chemicals, in a bathroom with a high chemical score. Or it may recommend using 100 percent soy and beeswax candles, since conventional candles omit high levels of volatile organic compounds. It\u2019s also programmed to remind users to keep up on housekeeping, from laundering linens to wiping away dust.\u000a\u000aPeople who own the Awair Glow can even turn on heaters, air conditioners and humidifiers remotely when the app detects unhealthy air. \u201cWe\u2019ve received emails from users raving about how they connect their irons to it because they always forget to turn it off,\u201d says Ro. \u201cWe\u2019ve even heard about some people connecting their crock pots, which we can\u2019t promote, but we admire the creativity.\u201d\u000a\u000aAwair can connect over Wi-Fi to Alexa, Google Home, Nest and the IFTTT web service to automate the process of purifying your air, and it keeps a log of recordings so you can track air quality over time.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aRo says his team is still working on improving the user experience, adding that his team values feedback and is continually updating the tips to make sure users are comfortable with them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have accomplished much since we launched Awair in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking at the roadmap, one thing is clear: This is just the beginning.\u201d\u000a\u000aKatie Jackson is a travel writer.

aVFrom the bestselling team of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard comes Killing Reagan, a page-turning epic account of the career of President Ronald Reagan that tells the vivid story of his rise to power -- and the forces of evil that conspired to bring him down.\u000a\u000aJust two months into his presidency, Ronald Reagan lay near death after a gunman's bullet came within inches of his heart. His recovery was nothing short of remarkable -- or so it seemed. But Reagan was grievously injured, forcing him to encounter a challenge that few men ever face. Could he silently overcome his traumatic experience while at the same time carrying out the duties of the most powerful man in the world?\u000a\u000aTold in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton, Killing Reagan reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in the California governor's mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan's most heroic actions. In Killing Reagan, O'Reilly and Dugard take readers behind the scenes, creating an unforgettable portrait of a great man operating in violent times.

In March, activists protested outside his Bristol restaurant after he went on a television show and encouraged people to drink milk.\u000a\u000aIn the same article, Oliver said that he was annoyed by vegans, but that he also cares for them. Though the chef can understand where meat-free supporters are coming from, he still, rightfully, takes issue with the way they convey their message \u2013 by interrupting his patron\u2019s dining experience.\u000a\u000aFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSBottom of Form\u000a\u000aPerhaps his concern stems from his own desire for people to be more food conscious. Oliver has before advocated for adopting vegan and vegetarian diets a few times a week to save money and create less impact on the environment. Oliver, himself, has admitted to eating meat free three times a week, and even creating a vegetarian cookbook.\u000a\u000aStill, vegans seem to \u201chate\u201d the seasoned chef.
