aVBy Michelle Malkin, For Townhall.com\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLiberal business executives are leaping like lemmings from President Donald Trump's manufacturing advisory council. Good riddance.\u000a\u000aThese silly string-spined CEOs have sided with social justice agitators, Beltway media enablers and Democratic resistance knuckleheads who believe Trump was wrong to condemn violence and hatred on all sides of the political spectrum. Never mind that of the four people arrested after the violent outbreak in Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend, two were identified with the white nationalist movement and the other two were left-wing "antifa" counterprotesters.\u000a\u000aOne of those radical leftists is the man identified as having reportedly punched a female reporter for the D.C.-based newspaper, The Hill. But since that doesn't fit the national media narrative of journalists allegedly being victimized by right-wing incitements to violence, mum's the word from corporate media executives and the rest of the preening CEOs.\u000a\u000aMerck CEO Kenneth C. Frazier claimed he stepped down from the Trump business panel because he felt "a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism." But Frazier, who served on President Obama's Export Council, felt no equivalent responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism when the White House invited leaders from the violence-inciting Black Lives Matter movement for a forum on policing in July 2016.

aVBy Dan Gainor, Fox News\u000a\u000aSome news stories are so insane that the first reaction has to be disbelief. That was the case Tuesday night when it was revealed that ESPN had pulled a broadcaster from covering a football game simply because he has a similar name to a Confederate general.\u000a\u000aIn one ridiculous move, ESPN became a metaphor for everything wrong in media.\u000a\u000aPoor Robert Lee, an Asian-American with no relation to Army of Northern Virginia Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, was scheduled to announce the University of Virginia\u2019s home opener. But after the Charlottesville protests ESPN feared that his name might be a \u201ctrigger\u201d to its nonexistent audience of social justice warriors, following. So Lee (the Asian-American one, not the general) was dropped from the broadcast faster than you can whistle \u201cDixie.\u201d\u000a\u000aRELATED: Starnes: Hey ESPN -- Robert E. Lee Was Not Asian-American\u000a\u000aThe website Outkick scooped the world, reporting that, \u201cMSESPN Pulls Asian Announcer Named Robert Lee Off UVa Game To Avoid Offending Idiots.\u201d That was too subtle. Comparing ESPN and MSNBC only scratches at the surface of how left-wing the \u201csports\u201d network has become.\u000a\u000aESPN President John Skipper has single-handedly wrecked what was once an icon of the sports world. Skipper spent eight years working for left-wing Rolling Stone before shifting and moving over to its competitor Spin magazine. Even The Washington Post called him \u201ca gangly, Southern hippie.\u201d Hippie was an understatement.\u000a\u000aIt has been downhill for The Worldwide Leader in Sports since Skipper took over the network completely in 2012. Subscribers have dropped off, conservative voices have been largely purged and social justice outdoes sports on a regular basis.

aVYou got lost hiking in the woods and you finished all the water you carried in with you. Now that you\u2019ve found the trail again, you\u2019re hot and thirsty and worried about dehydration. There\u2019s a stream up ahead. Is the water safe to drink?\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re pounding the pavement in an unfamiliar city on a very hot day. Can you trust the public water fountain? Come to think of it, can you trust the one in your office building?\u000a\u000aNow there\u2019s a water bottle that will answer those questions \u2014 and even purify the water, if necessary. And if it sounds ludicrous to shell out more than $200 for such a thing, ask yourself this: How much are you willing to pay for peace of mind?\u000a\u000a\u201cWater is life, but water pollution has become a nationwide problem,\u201d says Eric Li, the founder and CEO of Ecomo, maker of the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d water bottle.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Li, who also has a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, referred to a Harvard University study conducted last year that found unsafe levels of toxic chemicals in drinking water in 33 states, including California, New Jersey, Florida and New York. Among those chemicals were PFASs (polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances), which have been linked to hormonal problems, obesity and cancer.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why Li invented the Ecomo (short for \u201ceco-monitor\u201d) Bottle.\u000a\u000aThe stainless steel bottle tests water for contaminants and, if it\u2019s not up to snuff, removes them quickly to make it safe to drink.\u000a\u000aUnlike one of its competitors, CamelBak\u2019s All Clear ($99), which uses UV technology to purify unsafe water in 60 seconds, Ecomo uses a complex filtration system that does the job in less than five seconds. It took Li and his team two years to create, but for the consumer it\u2019s as simple as fill, shake, twist and drink \u2014 unless the water is already fine for drinking, in which case you can eliminate \u201ctwist.\u201d\u000a\u000aUsers can fill the bottle at practically any source: tap, pond, even toilet \u2014 and then activate its testing mechanism by shaking it. The bottle\u2019s filtration system, composed of carbon and ion exchange fibers and a nanofiber membrane, analyzes four things: the TOC (total organic carbon) level, the TDS (total dissolved solids) level, turbidity or cloudiness and water temperature. If the water is good to drink, a green light and the word \u201cGood\u201d appear on the bottle\u2019s LED monitor. If it\u2019s contaminated, as indicated by a yellow or red light and the word \u201cFair\u201d or \u201cBad,\u201d a twist of the bottle\u2019s base will reduce bacteria, pesticides, petroleum products and heavy metals by up to 99.9 percent.\u000a\u000aThe bottle weighs 13 ounces and has double-layer insulation designed to keep water hot for 12 hours or cold for 24 hours. It holds 20 ounces of water \u2014 and only water. Filling it with another liquid can damage the bottle\u2019s analyzer. The first bottles aren\u2019t expected to ship until late this year, but Ecomo has already caught the attention of Tech Insider, Gear Junkie and Fast Company, which called it \u201can invention for our increasingly poisonous world.\u201d\u000a\u000aEcomo Bottle is currently available for pre-ordering on the crowdfunding website IndieGoGo, where it\u2019s discounted to $139. Ecomo has raised nearly $600,000 \u2014 more than nine times its goal since the campaign launched in October \u2014 and it\u2019s on IndieGoGo\u2019s Must-Have Products for Your Office list.\u000a\u000aEventually, Li says, the goal is to get the bottle into stores, where the retail price will be $220. It could be the most expensive water bottle on the market, but it will also be the only one of its kind.\u000a\u000aChloe Li, Ecomo's vice president of marketing (no relation to Eric), describes Ecomo\u2019s core customers as people in their 30s to mid-40s who care about their health and are aware of the latest trends in technology. They\u2019re people who don\u2019t mind recharging batteries \u2014 the Ecomo Bottle\u2019s battery lasts up to a week and takes an hour to recharge \u2014 and buying replacement filters for $10 every two to three months.\u000a\u000aThe Ecomo has an app that notifies users when it\u2019s time to buy a new filter and a Bluetooth wristband that measures environmental conditions like the temperature, records users\u2019 daily activities to calculate their hydration needs and then keeps track of their water intake throughout the day.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnlike many other hydration trackers, it will not be a rough estimate based on a predefined average daily consumption of an average person,\u201d said Chloe Li. \u201cSo it\u2019s much more accurate.\u201d\u000a\u000aEcomo also aims to collect data on water quality throughout the U.S., and eventually the world, through crowdsourcing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want a place where everybody can receive data on their water quality at any time,\u201d said Eric Li. \u201cWhen a user takes a measurement and presses the bottle\u2019s \u2018send\u2019 button, the water quality data collected will be sent to the Ecomo website and used toward a real-time water quality map.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut first, Li has to oversee the distribution of the Ecomo Bottle and his other product, Ecomo Fount, which is scheduled to be released in September. Mounted on a kitchen faucet, Ecomo Fount will test for and filter the same four things as Ecomo Bottle, and it will come with a free app, Ecomo Lab, that will chart results by the month to show users the history of their water quality. The data will be synched to the cloud and uploaded to a water quality map so users can see the scores of the water around them.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re human \u2014 and chances are very good that you are \u2014 then your body is roughly 60 percent water.

aVTen states may soon sue President Trump -- for treating illegal immigrants too leniently.\u000a\u000aTexas attorney general Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general plan to file suit against the Trump administration unless it ends the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by September 5.\u000a\u000aDACA, a program established under President Obama, grants work permits and an official reprieve from deportation to over 750,000 illegal immigrants who came to the United States as minors.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump lambasted DACA as unconstitutional on the campaign trail. He vowed to end it on Day One of his administration. But thus far, he has kept the program in place -- even though federal courts have found DACA to be an illegal overreach of executive authority, and the Trump Administration already ended a companion program that granted reprieves and work permits to parents of DACA recipients.\u000a\u000aThe Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States.\u000a\u000aIt's time for President Trump to fulfill his vow. DACA is flagrantly unconstitutional. And it hurts vulnerable American workers.\u000a\u000aThe Constitution gives Congress -- not the president -- the authority to determine who may legally enter and reside in the United States. One year before enacting DACA, President Obama himself explained "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed."\u000a\u000aBut President Obama and his lawyers found what they thought was a clever way around this constitutional barrier. DACA, they said, doesn't give permanent legal residency to illegal aliens. It merely makes them a very, very low priority for deportation. Such a low priority, in fact, that all 750,000 illegal aliens who signed up for the program would receive an official card instructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to deport them unless they committed multiple criminal offenses.\u000a\u000aIt's highly questionable whether the executive branch has this much leeway to selectively enforce Congress' immigration laws. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Andrew Hanen, who issued an injunction freezing an expansion of the DACA program in 2015, explained that, "DHS cannot reasonably claim that, under a general delegation to establish enforcement policies, it can establish a blanket policy of non-enforcement that also awards legal presence and benefits to otherwise removable aliens."\u000a\u000aEven supporters of amnesty for illegal aliens agree DACA is unconstitutional. In December, Senator Lindsay Graham tweeted, "In my view, the DACA Executive Order issued by President Obama was unconstitutional and President-elect Trump would be right to repeal it." For reference, Sen. Graham has sponsored the DREAM Act, a bill that would give U.S. citizenship to illegal aliens who came here as children.\u000a\u000aEven if the executive branch did have authority to exempt an entire class of people from deportation, DACA would still be unconstitutional. That's because the president doesn't have the authority to hand out work permits to illegal aliens. As Judge Hanen noted, "Exercising prosecutorial discretion...does not also entail bestowing benefits."\u000a\u000aLegal arguments aside, the DACA program hurts American workers.\u000a\u000aAn alarming number of American workers without college degrees are struggling to find work. In the first quarter of 2017, nearly four in ten native-born 18 to 29-year olds without college degrees were either unemployed or not in the labor force.\u000a\u000aIllegal immigration exacerbates these young Americans' struggles by increasing the number of people competing for a limited supply of lower-skilled and entry-level jobs. Over the past 20 years, illegal aliens without high school degrees have inflated the low-skill U.S. workforce by approximately 22 percent.\u000a\u000aThe excess of low-skilled workers means companies don't need to raise wages to fill positions. Native-born workers without a high school degree would earn nearly $800 more annually if there were no illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aThe burdens of illegal immigration disproportionately fall on American minorities. Harvard Kennedy School economics professor George Borjas' explains that "Because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip."\u000a\u000aPut simply, our most economically vulnerable citizens have the most to lose if President Trump preserves the DACA program.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump repeatedly vowed to end DACA to protect American workers and the rule of law. It's time for him to follow through on this promise.\u000a\u000aBruce C. Perryman, Ph.D., is a retired member of the U.S. Air Force and served as president of two community colleges in Colorado and Minnesota.

This can lead to crowding in the aisles and more close contact between passengers, which can spread disease, according to the study.\u000a\u000aRELATED: WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE USING A HOTEL HAIR DRYER\u000a\u000aThe researchers suggest the best way to board is by splitting the plane into two sections and randomly boarding passengers in these groups.\u000a\u000aTo test this, the study evaluates a hypothetical case of a passenger with Ebola and to see how close contact with the disease might change and spread based on boarding strategy.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe consider the situation with one infected individual with Ebola traveling on a commercial airplane,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe infective passenger onboard is not identifiable; therefore, we varied the seating position of the infected individual through all the seats.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the suggested boarding process, the estimated risk of exposure to illness dropped from 67 percent to 40 percent.\u000a\u000aRELATED: EVERY AIRLINE HAS A DIFFERENT BOARDING PROCESS \u2014 HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\u000a\u000aThe data also found that smaller planes are much less likely to spread infection, since fewer people means fewer chances of an outbreak.\u000a\u000a\u201cUsing smaller airplanes during an outbreak, instead of completely banning flights to a specific destination, can drastically reduce the probability of introduction of infection,\u201d said Anuj Mubayi, one of the authors of the study.\u000a\u000aThis article originally appeared on Travel and Leisure

aVSebastian Gorka, President Donald Trump's national security aide, has departed from his White House position late Friday.\u000a\u000aIt was not immediately clear whether Gorka had resigned or had been fired. In a purported resignation letter obtained by the Federalist, Gorka said the "best and most effective way" he could support President Trump "is from outside the People\u2019s House."\u000a\u000aHowever, White House officials told Fox News late Friday that Gorka did not actually resign, but confirmed he "no longer works" at the White House.\u000a\u000aA Trump adviser familiar with the circumstances of Gorka's departure told Fox News that the deputy assistant recently had a tense phone conversation with new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly in which Kelly asked Gorka why he was on a long vacation in the middle of myriad national security challenges.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about his exit, Gorka texted Fox News a one-word response: "Liberating."\u000a\u000aGorka later called to say that in terms of his vacation, Kelly "never mentioned it for a millisecond."\u000a\u000aGorka's version is he called Kelly on Friday through the Situation Room and told the chief of staff he was resigning and wanted to come into the office on Monday to hand-deliver his resignation letter to the president. Kelly basically short-circuited that by suggesting there was no need for Gorka to come back to the White House.\u000a\u000aIn his letter, Gorka expressed dissatisfaction with the direction of the Trump administration, saying that "given recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the [Make America Great Again] promise are \u2013 for now \u2013 ascendant within the White House."\u000a\u000aGorka added that apart from Trump himself, "the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will 'Make America Great Again,' have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months."\u000a\u000aGorka was a controversial figure in the Trump administration, with Democrats accusing him of having ties to white supremacist groups. He was also close to Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist who was fired from the White House last week and has since returned to his former post as the executive chairman of Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aLast week, Rep.

aVA family in the U.K. said they are receiving invaluable advice from Charlie Gard\u2019s mother as they fight an uphill battle to keep their son alive. Alfie Evans, who is 15-months-old, has been in a coma for eight months, with doctors suspecting that he has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, Metro News reported.\u000a\u000aHis parents, Thomas Evans and Kate James, launched a fundraising campaign in the hopes of bringing Alfie abroad for treatment, but are concerned that the courts will prevent their efforts, similar to what happened with Charlie.\u000a\u000aCHARLIE GARD'S DISEASE AND LEGAL CASE: AN EXPLAINER\u000a\u000a\u201cThe doctors have indicated that his parents should withdraw life support and \u2018allow him to die peacefully\u2019 because that\u2019s \u2018in his best interest,\u2019\u201d the family said in a statement, according to Metro News.\u000a\u000aBut Evans counters that his son is not in a vegetative state, and vowed not to give up their fight. Alfie is currently at Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have given him days to live. According to an aunt, the family has been receiving advice from Charlie\u2019s mother, Connie Yates, about fundraising and how to contact specialists.\u000a\u000aCharlie died in July after his case received international attention over the highly publicized court battle to treat him with an experimental approach in the U.S. Yates and Charlie\u2019s father, Chris Gard, had raised $1.7 million to take their son to the U.S. for a treatment, but lost their months-long court battle. Alfie\u2019s aunt has accused her nephew\u2019s doctors of shying away from the case over fear of backlash, Metro News reported.\u000a\u000aCHARLIE GARD TO BE BURIED WITH 'BELOVED' TOY MONKEYS\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is currently intubated and has a ventilator helping him to breathe, but is also seen by doctors and family breaths himself,\u201d Evans said, according to Metro News. \u201cHe has come off life support three times and shown he can manage a maximum of 13 days without the ventilator. We believe that is someone out there who knows and can help us find out what is wrong with Alfie, so that we may create and follow a proper medical plan of car for him.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the family\u2019s JustGiving website, Alfie was born healthy but missed developmental milestones. He then contracted a chest infection and suffered a seizure, which landed him in the hospital, where he has developed chronic seizures and is continuing to decline.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur little soldier has had a better day today,\u201d Evans wrote in an Aug. 24 post on the Alfie\u2019s Army Facebook page. \u201cThe last two days have been critical for him, but although he is still very poorly, he has stabilized today. He is taking breaths and is trying to open his eyes during seizures.\u201d

aVBy Matt Vespa | Townhall.com\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Former Director Of National Intelligence James Clapper questioned President Trump\u2019s fitness for office, where CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, who suffered a total meltdown after the Phoenix rally, asked if that makes the president a national security threat. It was a totally unhinged night of political commentary from the Left, but also highly entertaining. There were insinuations about Trump\u2019s mental state, specifically if he has early on-set dementia\u2026because people didn\u2019t like what he said. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) has said Trump\u2019s remarks about the recent violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia was justification enough for his removal from office.

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data. If the sensor detects dangerous levels of radon for longer than 48 hours, it notifies the user and recommends what to do next. The sensor also gives audio alerts.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aIf high levels of radon are detected, experts recommend getting in touch immediately with a contractor who can implement a radon reduction system that will reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. It will set you back around $800-$1,200 \u2014 or more if the home has crawl spaces, no gravel under the slab or a completely finished lower level.\u000a\u000a\u201cEach state radon or radiation department should have a list of qualified contractors,\u201d Brodhead said. \u201cIt is usually best to have a local qualified contractor do the work to get better service.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrodhead recommends hiring a contractor who visits your home before submitting an estimate. He also advises getting more than one estimate and checking with references.

aVBy Maxim Lott | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe left has upped the stakes in its guerilla operations against Republicans, as deep-pocketed groups fund protesters to show up to the offices and even houses of congressmen to protest their lack of "town hall" meetings.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, protesters targeted the home of Rep. Jason Lewis, a newly elected Republican in Minnesota's 2nd District. The protests on his doorstep grew big enough that one of his neighbors called the police.\u000a\u000a"Fortunately my family wasn't home at the time,\u201d Lewis told Fox News. \u201cI ran for Congress, but my family didn't run ... so to bring them into it I think is not in keeping with the best of American tradition."\u000a\u000aProtesters also have shown up at the homes of other Republican lawmakers in swing districts such as Rep. John Faso, R-N.Y., and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. Some 200 protesters showed up at Issa's home to blast him for not holding town hall meetings, leading his spokesman to say: \u201cDragging the congressman\u2019s wife and family into this goes beyond the pale.\u201d\u000a\u000aLocal chapters of a left-wing group called \u201cIndivisible\u201d helped organize and lead those two protests.

aVCalifornia correctional officials on Friday asked state regulators to approve a revised method of carrying out death sentences after years of delays that have stalled executions since 2006.\u000a\u000aThe new regulations would allow California's death row inmates to be executed using one of two different drugs or choose the gas chamber.\u000a\u000aThe state is acting after what critics say are years of delaying tactics by Democratic office-holders who have been in no hurry to resume carrying out the death penalty.\u000a\u000aCorrections officials filed the revised regulations one day after the state Supreme Court upheld a voter-approved measure to speed up death sentences. That leaves one major obstacle before executions can resume: Getting approval for a new lethal injection method.\u000a\u000aAmong other things, the justices' decision upholding Proposition 66 ends the requirement that prison officials receive approval from state regulators for their new lethal injection plan.\u000a\u000aCorrections officials, however, decided to submit the revised regulations to the state Office of Administrative Law and follow the normal regulatory process until the justices' decision becomes final.\u000a\u000aKent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, isn't bothered by their decision even though his organization had to sue to pressure corrections officials into adopting the new execution regulations after three years of delays.\u000a\u000a"That's cautious but I can't say that being cautious is a bad thing, because they know they're going to be sued \u2014 they always are," he said.\u000a\u000aThe high court's decision could become final as soon as late next month, although the court could extend that time for an additional 60 days. Once it becomes final, corrections officials will no longer need regulatory approval for the new lethal injection rules, so those will become final as well.\u000a\u000aThe next step would then be for state officials to ask a federal judge and a Marin County superior court judge to lift separate longstanding injunctions that applied to California's old way of executing inmates using a combination of three lethal drugs.\u000a\u000aThose injunctions have prevented the state from executing anyone since 2006.\u000a\u000aUnder the new rules, corrections officials would choose between the powerful barbiturates pentobarbital or thiopental for each execution, depending on which one is available.\u000a\u000aThey initially proposed using any one of four drugs, but they dropped two of them after opponents said those drugs had never been used in executions and questioned whether the drugs would be safe and effective.\u000a\u000aThere may be other legal challenges to the final rules, however. Opponents already are objecting, for instance, that the rules allow the state to obtain the barbiturates from compounding pharmacies instead of manufacturers as the state attempts to work around a nationwide shortage of execution drugs.

Last month Trump clarified that he is considering Cohn for the post in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI\u2019ve known Gary for a long time, but I\u2019ve gained great respect for Gary working with him, so Gary certainly would be in the mix,\u201d Trump said while also noting that Yellen was doing a solid job.\u000a\u000aAs for Yellen, in June, she reiterated her commitment as Fed Chair. \u201cSo what I\u2019ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve out my term as Chair, which ends in early February. I have not had conversations with the President about future plans,\u201d she said in response to a question following the FOMC\u2019s June meeting in which policymakers raised the key benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 1 to 1.25%.\u000a\u000aYellen began her Fed Chair term in February of 2014, moving up from Vice Chair, on the appointment of President Obama. And Yellen, like Cohn, served on the National Economic Council of Economic Advisors from 1997-1999.\u000a\u000aSuzanne O\u2019Halloran is Managing Editor of FOXBusiness.com and a graduate of Boston College.

aV\u201cLast Man Standing\u201d seems to be dying many deaths. Following its recent, and controversial, cancellation at ABC, the series has been hit once again with a bit of bad news and a bit of good news.\u000a\u000aAlthough new episodes of the series won\u2019t be made, fans have been able to watch the first five seasons on Netflix, but that\u2019s about to change. On September 30, the popular streaming service will no longer carry \u201cLast Man Standing.\u201d However, unlike its cancellation, the removal from Netflix only sounds controversial.\u000a\u000aAs TV Guide reports, things come and go from Netflix all the time for various reasons. The Tim Allen-led series is leaving the streaming giant, yes, but it\u2019s so that it can all be moved over to Hulu. 20th Century Fox recently struck a deal with Hulu for exclusive streaming rights to a lot of its back catalogue of TV, including \u201cLast Man Standing.\u201d So, while it will be sad for some to see it leave Netflix, it\u2019s joining Season 6, which is already available on a new home. Hulu has been making gains in the streaming market of late, securing other important properties like ABC\u2019s famed TGIF lineup, which will be available to users in September.\u000a\u000aDoing anything to mess with \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d and its fans is a tough sell right now. Fans were upset enough after ABC canceled the conservative-leaning sitcom to rally a petition to get it brought back to TV. When ABC tried to explain that the cancellation of the show had nothing to do with its politics, fans continued to balk.\u000a\u000aNetflix users have until September 30 to binge-watch all 5 seasons of \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d before it moves to Hulu.

aVFrom wild to weird, some people have a more elaborate sexual history than others. (No judgment here!)\u000a\u000aWhile the number of partners, specific deed, or fulfilled fantasy is in the past, sometimes history can have an effect on current relationships. There are a few reasons to keep former outrageous antics under wraps, but, in other cases, it\u2019s okay\u2014and even beneficial\u2014to share intimate secrets with someone else, says Tyra S. Gardner, Ph.D., psychotherapist and relationship therapist.\u000a\u000a"Sharing sexual history brings a stronger emotional closeness for the couple showing that neither has anything to hide," she says. "This strengthens their emotional and physical connection." It can also be helpful for sharing preferences and boundaries in the bedroom, explains Gardner.\u000a\u000aFor example, if your partner asks you to do something you're not entirely comfortable with due to a bad experience in the past, it may help to explain where your reservations come from. Here's what you should keep in mind when you're ready to spill the details:\u000a\u000aRELATED: THIS IS THE AGE WHEN YOU HAVE THE BEST SEX OF YOUR LIFE\u000a\u000aDo: Choose the right time and place\u000a\u000aWhile there are perks to being being totally transparent, it's important to choose the right time and place for story time. If info about your sexcapades isn't prompted by your partner, but rather you feel compelled to tell them, it has to be at the right stage in the relationship, which can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.\u000a\u000a"Create a pros and cons list to evaluate the benefits of having this discussion with your mate," says Gardner. It's also crucial to consider your S.O.'s personality.\u000a\u000a"In every relationship, mates always want to view you as being their first," says Gardner. "Some significant others are understanding of past relationships, others maybe sensitive and cannot handle that information."\u000a\u000aOnce you've decided to divulge: "Then determine when the time is right to share the information." Gardner says this should be a one-time-only discussion and in a stable setting.\u000a\u000a"Never wait until a negative situation occurs," she advises. If this info would make your partner jealous or stressed, then it's probably not a great idea to share.\u000a\u000aRELATED: 7 THINGS GUYS DO WHEN THEY\u2019RE NOT OVER THEIR EXES\u000a\u000aDo: Edit the information\u000a\u000aIf you do decide to tell your partner about your past, Garnder says it's also important to consider how much you should edit this sensitive information. "Knowing your significant other and how much they can handle is important when disclosing sexual history," says Gardner.\u000a\u000a"Painting a vivid picture of you with someone else can be hurtful. Stick to information, only." She also recommends not sharing too many details like familiar names.\u000a\u000aAnd on that note, you should probably steer clear of disclosing a crazy sexual act if it was with one of your partner's friends.\u000a\u000aRELATED: 5 THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER DO AFTER SEX\u000a\u000aDon't: Fib\u000a\u000aLies can may seem like a smart way to avoid a blowout argument or sidestep an uncomfortable situation\u2014but it can also backfire and have an impact on the present.\u000a\u000a"[The] relationship could end because [the] mate may feel that partner is 'hiding' something or have an 'alter ego/secret life', that they are not and will not be included to be a part [of]," says Gardner.\u000a\u000a"Feel free enough to speak with your significant other, and let them know what place you were emotionally at that time in your life. This helps them to understand better."\u000a\u000aDo: Be willing to listen to their confessions, too\u000a\u000aLastly, Gardner notes it's important to create a judgement free zone\u2014which works both ways. After all, your partner may open up to you and want to share their past as well.\u000a\u000a"Do not judge your significant other," says Gardner. "Keep in mind that these sexual acts and individuals were in the past, and do not condemn them for choices they made\u000a\u000aThis article originally appeared on Women\u2019s Health

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

aVMany people laugh at scams. We see an email from a mysterious stranger that\u2019s full of odd phrases and terrible misspellings, and we instantly share it on social media. \u201cThe Prince of Nigeria wants to send me bars and bars of gold!\u201d we write, adding a laughing emoji. \u201cShould I take it?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut not all scams are so easy to spot. Scammers get more sinister every day, and they use real-sounding email addresses, personal data, well-phrased letters and actual corporate logos to lure their victims. The savviest con artists work remotely, coaxing money out of people they\u2019ve never met.\u000a\u000aRelated: Click here to learn more about a convincing tech support scam that people are falling for.\u000a\u000aIn this era of rampant data theft and cybercrime, it\u2019s more important than ever to be aware of swindlers\u2019 stories, because the effects can be felt for months or years. Most cons want to score fast money, but you\u2019ll want to protect all your information from fraud, not just your credit numbers and bank accounts.\u000a\u000aRelated: Click here to learn just how many people have been targeted by telephone scams.

It\u2019s so easy to be taken by the swindlers.\u000a\u000a1. Job scam\u000a\u000aSome people joke about being \u201cbetween jobs,\u201d but there\u2019s nothing funny about unemployment. Looking for a new job is stressful, and as the weeks turn into months, you may jump at any opportunity, no matter how dubious or grim.\u000a\u000aScammers know this, and they prey on desperate people. They send emails with headings like \u201cYour Résumé\u201d or \u201cWork From Home Job.\u201d At first, these sound like exciting opportunities. Can you really make $1,200 a week sitting on your couch?\u000a\u000aEmployment scams are common, and you don\u2019t have to be jobless to find their offers enticing. Many of their targets are people who are unemployed or underpaid and eager for a change of pace. No matter what the location or time of year, scammers find needy victims with bills to pay.\u000a\u000aThis year, I\u2019ve noticed a rise in two different types of job-related scams that look very convincing if you don\u2019t know how to watch out for them.\u000a\u000aMailed Check: In this scam, you apply for a job and get a response. Your potential employer mails a check that\u2019s made out to you for $500 or so. (That should be a red flag. Why would they pay you before you start working? Reputable companies don't do that.) Then the scammers call or email you to say the mailed check was a mistake, and would you wire the funds back to them? If you fall for it, their bad check won't cover the funds. The money will come out of your bank account.\u000a\u000aUpfront Fees: Some fake companies will require an \u201cactivation fee,\u201d or even upfront costs for \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201cmaterials.\u201d If you\u2019re dying for work, you might convince yourself that this is normal because you need to \u201cspend money to make money.\u201d Don\u2019t rationalize. Legitimate employers should not require fees.\u000a\u000a2. Vacation scam\u000a\u000aMany Americans get morose about vacations. They don\u2019t have much time off; travel is expensive and complicated; and they\u2019ll only return to mountains of unfinished work. Why bother?\u000a\u000aSo when you receive an email about an all-expenses-paid vacation package to Hawaii, you may do a double-take. Did you win some sweepstakes? Have you truly been randomly selected? Is this hotel handing out astonishing promotions?\u000a\u000aYes, it\u2019s possible to win a vacation, but if you don\u2019t remember entering a contest, run an online check. If you\u2019ve never heard of the company offering you round-trip flights and luxury resorts, be skeptical. In this case, scammers may call you or email you or post a vacation package on Facebook and then ask for personal data, like a credit card number, to \u201chold the reservation.\u201d\u000a\u000aNever give this information away unless you know for a fact that the company is legitimate. Vacations are healthy and life-affirming, but they are best handled on your own or through a respected travel agency.\u000a\u000aRelated: Click here on how to use public Wi-Fi and not get hacked.\u000a\u000a3. Concert and theater scams\u000a\u000aSimilar to vacation scams, these start with someone contacting you, or by you responding to an ad that you see online. The scammers say they're selling tickets for a hot show or a band you've been following for years. They excitedly tell you about the venue and the great value you're getting, because they\u2019ve discounted the price.\u000a\u000aWhen they ask you to wire money or submit credit card information, you may not even know it\u2019s a hoax. But tickets can be reproduced easily with the right gear. It may not be until you\u2019re turned away at the event that you discover the tickets were fake and you got taken.\u000a\u000a4. Moving scam\u000a\u000aLate summer is one of the busiest times of year to move into a new home. Whether you\u2019re a student switching apartments or a parent moving to a better school district, you\u2019ll probably find yourself migrating on a sunny weekend in August.\u000a\u000aFake moving companies may call you, or drop you an email, or leave a flyer on your doorstep. In the ugliest situations, the company will verbally quote a number, move you into your new home and then demand far more money than you expected. There are some cases of \u201cmovers\u201d packing all your worldly possessions into a truck and then driving off with it.\u000a\u000aRelated: Click here for two other scams that are popular on Craigslist.\u000a\u000aDo not fall for this scam. Most moving companies will offer to come to your home to see how much furniture they\u2019ll need to move. They will give you a written estimate. They are bonded and have insurance. You get the point.\u000a\u000aHere's how to stay safe: Check the Better Business Bureau \u2014 BBB.org \u2014 to see if the moving company is a reputable business.\u000a\u000aThen have the movers come to your house and give you a final estimate before you move.\u000a\u000a5. Owed money scam\u000a\u000aEverybody loves automatic payments, because they save time writing checks or looking up charges. But as the years wear on, you may have forgotten to pay up. Cards expire, payments fail to go through and we forget about them. We may even miscalculate our taxes, resulting in a bill and monthly fine.\u000a\u000aSo when we receive a letter in the mail marked \u201cUrgent: Payment Requested,\u201d we often think we\u2019ve done something wrong. Did you forget to pay a cable bill in 2007, and should you send a check for $72.89 now? The information is so specific, why should you doubt the sender? The last thing you want is a collections agency on your tail, so why not just pay the fee and get it over with?\u000a\u000aIn this case, you should make sure the collector is real. It is perfectly reasonable to receive a letter from a collection agency, especially if you\u2019ve moved a lot or are forgetful about paperwork. But before you send any money, spend a few minutes to see if the company is legit.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of money, there is one legitimate way you may get money back that you totally forgot about.\u000a\u000aBonus: No scam! Find your unclaimed money\u000a\u000aRight now, there's an estimated $41.7 billion in government unclaimed property programs, and some of that unclaimed money could be yours. Maybe you forgot to get that deposit back from the electric utility when you rented your first apartment. Or an insurance company may have issued you a refund on a policy but couldn't find you. Or you might have been enrolled in a pension plan that was discontinued.\u000a\u000aIn addition to utility refunds and insurance payments, unclaimed property includes abandoned savings or checking accounts, stocks, uncashed dividends or payroll checks, refunds, traveler's checks, trust distributions, unredeemed money orders or gift certificates (in some states), annuities, certificates of deposit, customer overpayments, mineral royalty payments and contents of safe deposit boxes. Whew!\u000a\u000aClick here for 7 ways to find and collect your unclaimed money.\u000a\u000aHow else can you protect yourself from thieves?

aVEveryone knows you can\u2019t run for governor of Ohio and head up an agency of the United States government at the same time. Then why is Richard Cordray, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), doing just that?\u000a\u000aIt was recently reported that a state judge in Ohio by the name of Bill O\u2019Neill was asked by a friend of Cordray\u2019s if he would stay out of the race for governor if Cordray became an official candidate. This is a campaign maneuver that\u2019s regularly employed in order to mitigate headaches in an upcoming race. In this case, Cordray is trying to limit the number of primary challengers he would face in the upcoming Democrat primary election next spring.\u000a\u000aThis is an outrage and another example of a liberal elitist who thinks the law doesn\u2019t apply to him. Engaging in this type of political activity is a clear violation of the Hatch Act and the allegations should be investigated by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel without delay.\u000a\u000aThe CFPB was created because of the disastrous Dodd-Frank law and specializes in job-killing regulations. Congress should place it on the ash heap of history or drastically reform it so that the agency can be forever defunded.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Special Counsel\u2019s \u201cGuide to the Hatch Act for Federal Employees,\u201d a covered employee: \u201cMay not be a candidate for nomination or election to public office in a partisan election\u201d and \u201cmay not use his or her official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election.\u201d\u000a\u000aI\u2019m glad to see that the Republican Governor\u2019s Association has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for relevant documents. RGA should be prepared to file a FOIA lawsuit if the CFPB doesn\u2019t comply in a timely manner.\u000a\u000aHardworking American taxpayers -- including the millions of Ohioans who fall into this category -- should demand that Cordray come clean and resign or state publicly that he won\u2019t be a candidate.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump could also fire him if he believes that Cordray is playing politics on taxpayer time.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not surprising that Cordray thinks he\u2019s above the law since the agency he leads was set up in exactly that fashion.\u000a\u000aThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not subject to traditional congressional oversight and is currently being threatened with contempt of Congress for not fully complying with committee subpoenas.\u000a\u000aIt was a Nancy Pelosi-led Congress that structured CFPB\u2019s budget so it\u2019s not subject to the congressional appropriations process.\u000a\u000aThe CFPB was created because of the disastrous Dodd-Frank law and specializes in job-killing regulations. Congress should place it on the ash heap of history or drastically reform it so that the agency can be forever defunded.\u000a\u000aRegardless of his campaign timetable, Cordray\u2019s five-year term ends in July 2018 and he ought to be remembered as the first and last director of this agency that exists to stifle American economic growth.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB were Obama-era mistakes and along with ObamaCare, big reasons why Republicans won control of Congress after the 2010 midterm elections.\u000a\u000aCordray is likely delaying his resignation so that he can continue to draw his nice taxpayer-funded salary as long as possible, since he would become an unemployed full-time candidate once he comes out of the shadows and starts running officially.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic candidates already running for the Ohio governor\u2019s mansion should turn up the heat on Cordray and tell him that he can\u2019t have it both ways.\u000a\u000aWhen Richard Cordray does finally return to Ohio, he might be surprised by what he finds.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump carried the Buckeye State by a whopping eight points running against the anemic Obama economy that Cordray himself helped create.\u000a\u000aMake no mistake about it -- the Ohio voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency fully understand this fact.\u000a\u000aDavid N. Bossie is President of Citizens United, a Fox News Contributor and the former Deputy Campaign Manager for Donald Trump for President.

aVBy Rep. Markwayne Mullin, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe conversation happening in our nation in light of recent events is more about political correctness than the issue at hand. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and terrorists are bad people. The ideals of these groups are in opposition to everything our nation stands for and everything that holds true to our founding principles. Their hatred of people dissimilar to them is un-American and it should not be tolerated under any circumstances.\u000a\u000aDays ago, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, announced that he plans to introduce legislation that would remove all of the statues in the U.S. Capitol that honored Confederate soldiers. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has also called for the elimination of such statues. I respect their rights as elected officials to put forth legislation they believe is in the best interest of their constituents, however I simply do not agree.\u000a\u000aAs a Cherokee, I can attest to the fact that Native Americans have been on the losing side of history. Our rights have been infringed upon, our treaties have been broken, our culture has been stolen, and our tribes have been decimated at the hands of our own United States government. Native Americans have faced centuries of atrocities to their people, their land, and their culture \u2013 all under various presidents who took an oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u000a\u000aUnder President Andrew Jackson in 1830, our government passed the Indian Removal Act that drove thousands of Native Americans out of their homes on the treacherous journey better known as the Trail of Tears. Under President Franklin Pierce in 1854, parts of Indian Territory were stolen from tribes to create the Kansas and Nebraska Territories. Under President Abraham Lincoln, the Sand Creek massacre occurred in 1864 when the U.S. Army attacked the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes unprovoked, killing about 250 Native Americans.

He shouldn\u2019t be negotiating Middle East peace.\u201d All three podcasters enjoyed referring to anyone near Trump as incompetent and liars. They agreed that healthcare reform is not dead in Congress, though. Their counter to the hopelessness felt by so many loser Democrats is to keep protesting and reaching out to members of Congress.\u000a\u000aThe three talked about parties at the White House and the White House Correspondents Dinner where they drank too much and showed up at the White House the next day to be sobered up by the photos of a dead Bin Laden. Gosh. Sorry that America\u2019s most wanted dead terrorist had to ruin your buzz, guys.\u000a\u000aChelsea asked if it was legal to stop White House briefings and they all said yes.

aVSaturday\u2019s hotly-anticipated boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and UFC Champion Conor McGregor is sparking a fierce battle outside the ring over pirated livestreams.\u000a\u000aSaturday\u2019s fight at the T-Mobile arena in Las Vegas is being distributed live by Showtime Pay-Per-View, with pricing ranging from $90 to $100. Millions are expected to watch the intriguing battle between Mayweather and Irish MMA superstar McGregor.\u000a\u000aThe fight, however, has been described as potentially \u201cthe most pirated event in history\u201d and has already prompted legal action by Showtime Networks. Earlier this month, the CBS subsidiary sued more than 40 websites to prevent unauthorized streaming of the clash.\u000a\u000aWORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT GETS TOEHOLD IN CHINA WITH STREAMING DEAL\u000a\u000aDespite the move, Eric Feinberg, a founding partner of deep web analysis company GIPEC, told Fox News that pirated streams are still being promoted via social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem because it makes it look like it\u2019s legitimate,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe fight also presents a potential challenge for Facebook if footage of the bout is streamed via Facebook Live. This could be shot at the event itself, or via TV footage.\u000a\u000aFacebook told Fox News that it devotes "significant resources" to addressing copyright issues for live content on the platform. "Video publishers and media companies can provide reference streams of live content that are checked against files in our Rights Manager tool," explained a Facebook spokesperson, in a statement emailed to Fox News. "If a match surfaces, Rights Manager immediately takes action on the rule set by the rights holder \u2013 for example, to block that stream."\u000a\u000aROBERT KRAFT SAYS FOOTBALL\u2019S FUTURE IS VIA LIVESTREAMING\u000a\u000aThe spokesperson added that rights holders can also report live videos at any time during a live broadcast. "We've been growing our global team that processes these reports across time zones and continue to invest in our copyright tools," he said. "This remains a work in progress and we continue to listen to feedback from our partners to help improve our offerings.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere is huge global interest in the super welterweight fight that marks 40-year-old Mayweather\u2019s return to the ring. The 12-time world champion, who is regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, retired undefeated in 2015 with a record of 49-0.\u000a\u000aThe 28-year-old McGregor is the first fighter to hold two UFC titles simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE PENTAGON DOESN\u2019T WANT ITS EMPLOYEES WATCHING MARCH MADNESS\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fan and media interest exceeds what we have seen for the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight in 2015,\u201d an event spokesperson told Fox News.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago Mayweather\u2019s welterweight world championship unification fight with Manny Pacquiao, which was distributed by HBO and Showtime, set a new record of 4.6 million pay-per-view buys. However, Saturday\u2019s clash is tipped to surpass this number.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, streaming app Periscope was forced to take down pirated streams of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, as were other streaming apps.\u000a\u000aFox Business reports that pay-per-view purchases for Mayweather vs. McGregor could be in the neighborhood of 5 million buys.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Mayweather told Fox Business that he expects to earn $300 million from the fight, with McGregor\u2019s earnings expected to top $100 million.\u000a\u000aTHE WEEK IN PICTURES\u000a\u000aFor the first time, Showtime is making the event available to consumers on ShowtimePPV.com and through the Showtime PPV app on Apple mobile and Apple TV devices.\u000a\u000aThe fight takes place at 9 p.m. EDT Saturday.\u000a\u000aFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers

To be clear, thinking about what is about to happen has little to do with the sheer visceral experience of being amazed by it, as we must be. Before thinking about it, we should perhaps first simply goggle at it, at the monumental majesty of these monstrously large heavenly orbs, both of which we typically take mostly for granted.\u000a\u000aIs it not remarkable that these ever-present objects \u2014 though separated by nearly one hundred million miles \u2014 should once in a very great while perform this curiously perfect dance? But to what end?\u000a\u000aBut what might make us start to think a bit about this event is that this celestial pas de deux is being performed only for us. Anywhere but here on this planet on Monday, the view of these two objects is nothing special. It is only what we see from our terrestrial vantage point that is special. It\u2019s almost as though what we will marvel at was artfully arranged specifically for our benefit. Which brings us to the curious and startling part of the story.\u000a\u000aAbout fifteen years ago an odd idea popped into my head. Google was just a gurgling infant. But I happened to have a sturdy Brittanica nearby and I pulled out a dusty volume and quickly discovered the diameter of the sun. It is precisely 864,576 miles. The diameter of the moon was listed at 2,159 miles. I then looked up the distance from Earth to the sun, which varies slightly, but is generally given as 93 million miles. And then I found the distance from Earth to the moon. That varies slightly too, so the average is given as 239,000 miles.

For Ivanka, if she is looking to talk to her father as his daughter and not a staff member, then she too can be an exception.\u000a\u000aBoth she and Kushner quickly submitted to Kelly's system, two White House officials told the Times. Access to Trump, previously unrestricted, will now be done by appointment.

aVWhen Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, America was deeply in debt, with its economy and dignity under attack. Pirates from North Africa\u2019s Barbary Coast routinely captured American merchant ships and held the sailors as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute payments far beyond what the new country could afford.\u000a\u000aFor fifteen years, America had tried to work with the four Muslim powers (Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco) driving the piracy, but negotiation proved impossible. Realizing it was time to stand up to the intimidation, Jefferson decided to move beyond diplomacy. He sent the U.S. Navy and Marines to blockade Tripoli\u2014launching the Barbary Wars and beginning America\u2019s journey toward future superpower status.\u000a\u000aFew today remember these men and other heroes who inspired the Marine Corps hymn: \u201cFrom the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli, we fight our country\u2019s battles in the air, on land and sea.\u201d Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates recaptures this forgotten war that changed American history with a real-life drama of intrigue, bravery, and battle on the high seas.

aVMore than 17,000 California National Guard soldiers won\u2019t have to payback more than $190 million in enlistment bonuses and other payments that had been handed out in error between 2004 and 2010, the Pentagon said.\u000a\u000aThe decision comes several years after an audit revealed the Guard was overpaying bonuses as it faced pressure to hit enlistment goals during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\u000a\u000aCalifornia lawmakers in Congress successfully pushed for the Pentagon to waive any repayments unless it could provide evidence a solider knew or should\u2019ve known they weren\u2019t eligible for the money.\u000a\u000a"I am pleased that an overwhelming majority of the service members affected by the California National Guard's bonus clawback will be able to get their bonuses back," Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said in a statement. "These enlistment bonuses and other benefits were accepted in good faith and were given in exchange for serving the nation."\u000a\u000aA report by the Pentagon found that a vast majority of the 17,485 soldiers that got bonuses or loan aid won\u2019t have to repay it or will be refunded if they already did. The report, given to the U.S. House and Senate Armed Services Committees on July 31, was first reported by the Los Angeles Times.\u000a\u000aThe Guard paid out $194.6 million in bonuses and $6.4 million in student loan repayments between 2004 and 2010 to California soldiers, the report found. More than 1,400 soldiers had been asked to pay back the debt when former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter suspended the recoupment plan in late 2016. An additional 16,000 who were given bonuses during the same time period were included in the Pentagon's review.\u000a\u000aRepublican Rep. Jeff Denham, who helped craft the legislation requiring the Pentagon evaluation, criticized the U.S. Department of Defense for taking so long to "admit their mistake."\u000a\u000a"The men and women who wear the cloth of this nation deserve the security of knowing that the country they swore an oath to protect has their back at the end of their service," Denham told the Times.\u000a\u000aThe "overwhelming majority" of soldiers given bonuses \u2014 a total of 17,092 \u2014 won't be asked to pay back any money or will receive a refund.\u000a\u000aThe remaining 393 cases involved soldiers who did not complete their enlistment terms, because they were absent without leave, failed to show up for basic training or had a substance abuse problem, the report said. Those soldiers can appeal their cases.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

He worked with the cheerleaders once or twice a week in the fall of 2015 and also during a summer camp in 2016. He was dismissed three days into the four-day camp after a coach saw him using a technique similar to that seen in the Denver videos.\u000a\u000aBoulder High's principal, James Hill, sent a letter to parents on Thursday asking anyone who had a problem working with Williams to tell administrators or police.\u000a\u000aWilliams couldn't be located for comment but he told The Denver Post on Thursday that the videos were taken out of context.\u000a\u000a"You can definitely say that what was in the video could be seen in a different light," he told the newspaper. "I would love to tell my story, but I can't say anything else at this time."\u000a\u000aWilliams graduated in the spring from the University of Colorado and often performed tumbling tricks before football games there.

aVTesla\u2019s first semi will keep on truckin\u2019\u2026for up to 300 miles.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s according to Ryder chief technology and procurement officer Scott Perry, who told Reuters he met with Tesla earlier this year and was informed that the battery-powered big rig the company is set to reveal in September will likely be a day cab with a range of 200-300 miles per charge.\u000a\u000aThat technically makes it a long-haul truck, but comes nowhere near the 1,000-1,500 mile range some diesel powered tractors can cover between fill-ups. This suggests Tesla is initially targeting the regional trucking market, which accounts for about one-third of the industry.\u000a\u000aBut while Tesla shared the details of this type of truck with Perry, he thinks other options could be on the way. \u201cI\u2019m not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate I think that\u2019s where they\u2019ll start,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTesla wouldn\u2019t comment on the report.\u000a\u000aTesla isn\u2019t the only company getting into the electric trucking business. Toyota is currently testing a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric semi that has a range of about 200 miles between fill-ups. It\u2019s hauling cargo between the ports of Long Beach and Long Angeles, along with the 16,000 diesel-powered trucks that service the ports. Meanwhile, a new company in Utah called Nikola Motors claims to have 7,000 orders for the hydrogen-powered semi it has in development, which has an expected range of 1,200 miles.\u000a\u000aAs far as Ryder is concerned, Perry didn\u2019t say if the company has committed to buying any of Tesla\u2019s trucks, but it did just ink a deal with California-based startup Chanje to lease, rent and service is China-made battery-powered delivery vans, which have a range of up to 100 miles.\u000a\u000aTOYOTA'S ELECTRIC SEMI IS QUICK AS LIGHTNING:

aVMy first thoughts weren\u2019t about religious liberty when I heard the news that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday against Joe Kennedy \u2013 a high school football coach in the state of Washington. The court said Kennedy properly lost his job when he refused a school district order to stop praying on the 50-yard-line of the Bremerton High School football field after games.\u000a\u000aInstead of thinking about Kennedy\u2019s case, my mind went back to another coach \u2013 a man and mentor who saved my life.\u000a\u000aI first met my high school football coach, Paul Moro, as an orphaned sophomore who had experienced many tragedies in my short life: my dad walking out on the family when I was 5; mom dying of cancer four years later; and my traumatic stint in the foster care system.\u000a\u000aAs you can imagine, I wasn\u2019t doing too well. I desperately needed a mentor to help me transition from boyhood to manhood.\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s what Coach Moro did for me. He was a tough, no-nonsense type of guy who pushed me to excellence \u2013 but he also showed me great compassion and got involved in the details of my life. I owe a lot to him.\u000a\u000aAnd while I don\u2019t know Joe Kennedy personally, he reminds me a lot of my Coach Mo \u2013 a man of principle and influence who\u2019s motivated by his Christian faith.\u000a\u000aIn this age of rampant fatherlessness, when about 17.4 million kids in the U.S. live without a dad in the home, we need men like Coach Kennedy to be involved with children who desperately need positive role models.\u000a\u000aInstead, Bremerton School District suspended Kennedy because he silently prayed at the end of football games at the 50-yard line, and later refused to renew his contract at the end of the 2015 season.\u000a\u000aMind you, Kennedy quietly prayed for seven years and no one ever complained. He never invited anyone to pray with him. Often, he would pray at midfield alone.\u000a\u000aAnd on the times that players from his team and even the opposing team would ask if they could join him, Kennedy would answer: \u201cIt\u2019s a free country, you can do whatever you want.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf only.\u000a\u000aIt was only after one person complimented the district on the coach\u2019s prayers that it responded by ordering the coach to stop praying after the game, bowing his head or even being physically present where students may be praying.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s absurd to think that, in a sport where concussions and injuries regularly happen, the school district is concerned about a man who silently prays and thanks God for his team and the safety of players.\u000a\u000aThe fear of litigation has put many school districts into overreaction mode \u2013 and sadly, the courts haven\u2019t helped guarantee our right to free speech and religion.\u000a\u000aInstead of interpreting the First Amendment reasonably, the 9th Circuit is coming to conclusions that the average person doesn\u2019t understand or agree with.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s be reasonable. We cannot simply ignore the assertion in our Declaration of Independence that God has given us inalienable rights like the freedoms of speech and religion \u2013 and that it is the duty of government to \u201csecure\u201d those rights.\u000a\u000aAs former teenage boy who was once helped by a man in the mold of Kennedy, I know how important men like him are. Now that I\u2019m a dad, I would love for my two sons to have coaches and teachers like him \u2013 people who live out the principles of honor, hard work, conviction and compassion. These are things we can all agree are right and good.\u000a\u000aI hope the Supreme Court eventually agrees to take Kennedy\u2019s case \u2013 and that common sense will prevail.\u000a\u000aJim Daly is president of Focus on the Family and host of its daily flagship broadcast.

aVBy MEGAN MCARDLE | Bloomberg View\u000a\u000aJames Damore, the author of the notorious Google memo, has had his 15 minutes of fame. In six months, few of us will be able to remember his name. But Google will remember \u2014 not the company, but the search engine. For the rest of his life, every time he meets someone new or applies for a job, the first thing they will learn about him, and probably the only thing, is that he wrote a document that caused an internet uproar.\u000a\u000aThe internet did not invent the public relations disaster, or the summary firing to make said disaster go away. What the internet changed is the scale of the disasters, and the number of people who are vulnerable to them, and the cold implacable permanence of the wreckage they leave behind.\u000a\u000aTry to imagine the Damore story happening 20 years ago. It\u2019s nearly impossible, isn\u2019t it? Take a company of similar scope and power to Google \u2014 Microsoft, say. Would any reporter in 1997 have cared that some Microsoft engineer she\u2019d never heard of had written a memo his co-workers considered sexist? Probably not. It was more likely a problem for Microsoft HR, or just angry water-cooler conversations.\u000a\u000aEven if the reporter had cared, what editor would have run the story? On an executive, absolutely \u2014 but a random engineer who had no power over corporate policy? No one would have wasted precious, expensive column inches reporting it. And if for some reason they had, no other papers would have picked it up. Maybe the engineer would have been fired, maybe not, but he\u2019d have gotten another job, having probably learned to be a little more careful about what he said to co-workers.\u000a\u000aCompare to what has happened in this internet era: The memo became public, and the internet erupted against the author, quite publicly executing his economic and social prospects. I doubt Damore will ever again be employable at anything resembling his old salary and status. (Unless maybe a supporter hires him to make a political statement.)

aVBy Joel Gehrke, The Washington Examiner\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAn exhibit alongside the nation's chief memorial to Thomas Jefferson will receive an update that reflects "the complexity" of his status as a founder of the United States and a slaveholder, according to stewards of the National Mall.\u000a\u000aThe decision reflects an acute awareness of the furor currently surrounding Confederate statues across the country. A non-profit group that provides critical support for the National Mall is bracing for similar protests against the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial, although "there has been much broader support for maintaining them," as one official put it. But the Trust for the National Mall, which depends on private donors to fulfill its mission, is getting out in front of the uproar.\u000a\u000a"In the coming weeks and months, the physical symbols of American history and democracy will be scrutinized and challenged," Catherine Townsend, president of the Trust for the National Mall, wrote in a letter to supporters. "When that happens, we will work with our partners to ensure the National Mall continues to be a vibrant and relevant place where Americans can learn about our history and imagine our future, together."\u000a\u000aIn practice, that means that visitors to "America's Front Yard" will see the Founding Fathers honored, but there will be a new emphasis on their personal records as slave-owners. The changes might first be apparent at the Jefferson Memorial; the Trust, even before the renewed debate over Confederate statues, has been planning to raise money to refurbish the National Park Service exhibit accompanying the memorial, which has deteriorated since its installment about 20 years ago.

He was able to save about $25,000 in two years by cutting back on housing, as well as transportation and dining expenses.\u000a\u000a"At the end of the day it comes down to a personal choice, but I was happy moving to a smaller apartment, moving closer to my office, and eating out less, to bank the difference," Sabatier wrote on Millennial Money.\u000a\u000aHe continued:\u000a\u000a"While I don't have the exact figures, I estimate that cutting back for 2 years, before buying my first home, I was able to save about $25,000 that I invested in 2011 and 2012, and that 'cutting back' is now worth more than $100,000 in my investment accounts.

If it's more than 30% of your pre-tax income, the standard measure of housing affordability, then it's time to make a change.\u000a\u000aTo really make progress on your savings goals, however, you'll want to limit your housing expenses even further. Look for a place that costs 25% or less of your after-tax income, and funnel all of the cash you save toward your retirement accounts.\u000a\u000aIn some parts of the country (hi, New York and the rest of the Northeast), the percentage spent on housing can be even higher than the 37% average.

aVPresident Trump granted a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., on Friday.\u000a\u000aArpaio, 85, was recently found guilty of criminal contempt for defying a judge's order to stop traffic patrols that allegedly targeted immigrants.\u000a\u000aHe had been charged with misdemeanor contempt of court for allegedly willfully defying a judge\u2019s order in 2011 and prolonging his patrols for another 17 months.\u000a\u000aArpaio acknowledged extending the patrols, but insisted it wasn't intentional, blaming one of his former attorneys for not properly explaining the importance of the court order and brushing off the conviction as a "petty crime."\u000a\u000aHe was expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and faced up to six months in jail if convicted.\u000a\u000a"Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now 85 years old, and after more than 50 years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon," the White House said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio," the president tweeted on Friday night. "He kept Arizona safe!"\u000a\u000aArpaio thanked Trump in an earlier tweet, saying that his conviction was the result of a "political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department."\u000a\u000aKnown for his controversial takes on many issues, including his "birther" campaign against former President Barack Obama and for housing inmates in desert tent camps, Arpaio is best known for his approach to battling illegal immigration. In 2009 he claimed to have arrested 30,000 illegal immigrants since starting his efforts in 2005.\u000a\u000aAt a rally in Phoenix, on Tuesday, the president asked supporters in the crowd if Arpaio was \u201cconvicted for doing his job?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe crowd cheered.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe should have had a jury, but I\u2019ll make a prediction: He\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t do it tonight, because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy.\u201d\u000a\u000a"We\u2019ll see what happens," Arpaio said amid discussion of the pardon.\u000a\u000a\u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m still going to support him as long as he is the president of the United States because that\u2019s the way I am," Arpaio said. "I don\u2019t desert for political reasons. I\u2019ll stick with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who has had a public feud with Trump in recent weeks, was unsupportive of the move.\u000a\u000a"Regarding the Arpaio pardon," Flake wrote on Twitter. "I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course."\u000a\u000aDuring the presidential campaign, Arpaio showered Trump with support. Trump, meanwhile, has invoked Arpaio's name in his calls for tougher immigration enforcement and used some of the same immigration rhetoric and advocated for tactics that made the former Arizona lawman a national name a decade earlier.\u000a\u000aArpaio appeared for Trump at rallies in Iowa, Nevada and Arizona, including a huge gathering in the affluent Phoenix suburb where the sheriff lives. Arpaio also gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he said Trump would prevent immigrants from sneaking into the country.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVFor more than half a century, football helmets have done a great job of preventing skull fractures, but they\u2019ve been ineffective when it came to preventing concussions and protecting the brain. They just weren\u2019t meant to do that.\u000a\u000aBut now there\u2019s a new helmet that\u2019s been designed to protect not only the skull, but what\u2019s inside it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Zero1 and it\u2019s ranked No. 1 on the NFL/NFLPA 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results. VICIS, the Seattle-based sports equipment company that makes the Zero1, says 25 of the NFL's 32 teams bought the helmets before spring practice, and the company hopes many NFL players \u2014 and players on at least 20 NCAA teams \u2014 will be wearing them during the upcoming season.\u000a\u000aDoug Baldwin, a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who is working with VICIS, said participation in football nationwide has diminished because of fear of concussions and their link to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) \u2014 but the Zero1 helmet should change all that.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a"We take significant hits on the football field. Football is a violent collision sport," Baldwin said. "A product like this can give you that confidence of safety. It can boost your performance. I think it's going to save the game."\u000a\u000aDave Marver, VICIS\u2019 co-founder and CEO, said the Zero1 has four protective layers that "are designed to work together to provide outstanding fit and mitigate impact forces or slow them before they can reach the head and brain \u2026 better than any helmet ever made":\u000a\u000aThe outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, yielding when it's hit and slowing impact forces.\u000a\u000aRight below that is a second, reflex layer of columns that "bend and eventually buckle upon impact."\u000a\u000aThe third layer is a very thin hard shell that protects against skull fractures.\u000a\u000aThe fourth, innermost layer is the form liner, which conforms to the player's head.\u000a\u000aMarver said traditional helmets have a hard outer shell that makes a \u201ccrack\u201d sound on impact. The Zero1, on the other hand, goes \u201cthump.\u201d\u000a\u000a"The sound of the game is going to change,\u201d Marver said. \u201cIt means that players are going to be better protected."\u000a\u000aDr. Sam Browd, a pediatric neurosurgeon and co-founder of VICIS, said no helmet will fully eliminate concussions from football. But he said the Zero1 should prove very effective in reducing them.\u000a\u000aBrowd teamed up with Marver and VICIS\u2019 chief technology officer, Per Reinhall, to create the Zero1 because he had treated many teenagers who had to quit football because of repetitive head injuries.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000a"This was sad,\u201d Marver said. \u201cSo Sam wanted to do something about that, and he brought Per and me together and we started the company."\u000a\u000aA Zero1 helmet costs $1,500, much more than others, "because it's a more sophisticated design," Marver said. Besides the potential to reduce concussions, the helmet provides better peripheral vision, so players can see more of the field and opponents coming at them.\u000a\u000aReinhall said VICIS\u2019 technicians "torture the helmet" extensively, using a linear ram machine and a pendulum that hits the helmet at different speeds to judge its performance in the company's "smash lab."\u000a\u000aBrowd said a lot of players who have test-driven the helmet, linemen in particular, have said they "don't feel the impact as much" when they are tackled.\u000a\u000a"It's really encouraging," he said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aAdded Baldwin: "There's a lot of concerns out there amongst parents and adults about their children being safe on the football field. We [have] introduced a piece of equipment that is going to make the game safer, make their youth safer, prolong their careers in the NFL, in high school or college or wherever it may be.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you have something sustainable \u2026 that's going to bring back the attention to the fun of the sport, and not necessarily the risks of the sport. It's going to help prevent injuries."

aVPrince Harry slammed the paparazzi in a new documentary for causing his mother Princess Diana's deadly crash in Paris 20 years ago, then photographing his dying mother instead of helping her.\u000a\u000aHarry spoke openly about her mother's death in the new BBC documentary, "Diana, 7 Days," saying the "hardest things to come to terms with" was the photographers' lack of remorse and help for Diana on the night of the deadly car crash.\u000a\u000a"I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her through into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her, while she was still dying on the back seat of the car," Harry said.\u000a\u000aPRINCES WILLIAM, HARRY REMEMBER THEIR FINAL CALL WITH DIANA\u000a\u000a"William and I know that. We've been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case," the prince added.\u000a\u000aHarry blamed the paparazzi for the crash and said though his mother had suffered severe head injury after the crash, she was "very much still alive" in the backseat.\u000a\u000a"Instead of helping, [they] were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat. And then those photographs ...made their way back to news desks in this country," Harry recalled.\u000a\u000aPRINCESS DIANA'S BROTHER: I WAS 'LIED TO' ABOUT EVENTS THAT LED TO PRINCES WALKING BEHIND THEIR MOM'S COFFIN\u000a\u000aThe documentary is scheduled to air on BBC1 Sunday night and features both Harry and Prince William opening up about the days following Diana's death. Harry praised his father, Prince Charles, for his support and said Queen Elizabeth II removed all newspapers to allow them to privately grieve.\u000a\u000a"Our grandmother deliberately removed the newspapers and things like that, so there was nothing in the house at all, so we didn't know what was going on," Harry said.

aVBy Pamela K. Browne, Cyd Upson, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aThe former British spy who put together an unverified dossier of explosive allegations about President Trump during last year\u2019s campaign has been ordered to give a deposition in a multi-million-dollar libel case brought against a media outlet that published the document.\u000a\u000aFormer MI-6 British Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele is fighting the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro, of the Southern District of Florida that he must answer questions in the suit against Buzzfeed. A lawyer directly involved in the case said the issue will likely be argued before the British courts where a similar libel case is being heard.\u000a\u000aSteele's London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence, authored the 35-page dossier while working for American-based Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson. The document, which was crafted as opposition research for unknown political rivals of Trump, contained salacious charges involving Trump and Russian prostitutes, but none of the claims have been corroborated and most media outlets steered clear of the dossier.

aVBy MEGAN MCARDLE | Bloomberg View\u000a\u000aJames Damore, the author of the notorious Google memo, has had his 15 minutes of fame. In six months, few of us will be able to remember his name. But Google will remember \u2014 not the company, but the search engine. For the rest of his life, every time he meets someone new or applies for a job, the first thing they will learn about him, and probably the only thing, is that he wrote a document that caused an internet uproar.\u000a\u000aThe internet did not invent the public relations disaster, or the summary firing to make said disaster go away. What the internet changed is the scale of the disasters, and the number of people who are vulnerable to them, and the cold implacable permanence of the wreckage they leave behind.\u000a\u000aTry to imagine the Damore story happening 20 years ago. It\u2019s nearly impossible, isn\u2019t it? Take a company of similar scope and power to Google \u2014 Microsoft, say. Would any reporter in 1997 have cared that some Microsoft engineer she\u2019d never heard of had written a memo his co-workers considered sexist? Probably not. It was more likely a problem for Microsoft HR, or just angry water-cooler conversations.\u000a\u000aEven if the reporter had cared, what editor would have run the story? On an executive, absolutely \u2014 but a random engineer who had no power over corporate policy? No one would have wasted precious, expensive column inches reporting it. And if for some reason they had, no other papers would have picked it up. Maybe the engineer would have been fired, maybe not, but he\u2019d have gotten another job, having probably learned to be a little more careful about what he said to co-workers.\u000a\u000aCompare to what has happened in this internet era: The memo became public, and the internet erupted against the author, quite publicly executing his economic and social prospects. I doubt Damore will ever again be employable at anything resembling his old salary and status. (Unless maybe a supporter hires him to make a political statement.)

aVJournalist and baseball lover Ed Henry reveals for the first time the backstory of faith that guided Jackie Robinson into not only the baseball record books but the annals of civil rights advancement as well. Through recently discovered sermons, interviews with Robinson\u2019s family and friends, and even an unpublished book by the player himself, Henry details a side of Jackie\u2019s humanity that few have taken the time to see.\u000a\u000aBranch Rickey, the famed owner who risked it all by signing Jackie to his first contract, is also shown as a complex individual who wanted nothing more than to make his God-fearing mother proud of him. Few know the level at which Rickey struggled with his decision, only moving forward after a private meeting with a minister he\u2019d just met. It turns out Rickey was not as certain about signing Robinson as historians have always assumed.\u000a\u000aWith many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized.\u000a\u000aThis book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson\u2019s already awe-inspiring legacy. Yes, Jackie and Branch are both still heroes long after their deaths. Now, we learn more fully than ever before, there was an assist from God too.

aVBy Kristine Marsh | NewsBusters\u000a\u000aThis past weekend CNN drew more criticism for its left-wing bias after posting a profile on the violent left-wing group \u201cAntifa,\u201d that rather generously described the communist group as \u201cseeking peace through violence.\u201d Despite the obvious contradiction in terms, at least the headline noted the group\u2019s violent motives (albeit in a really stupid way.) But that phrase was scrubbed just hours later by CNN in an apparent move to not offend members of the radical-left group.\u000a\u000aThe original article appeared online Friday afternoon, with the headline: \u201cUnmasking the Leftist Antifa Movement: Activists Seek Peace Through Violence.\u201d That one mention of violence in the headline was the only real objective criticism CNN\u2019s Sara Ganim and Chris Welch had to offer throughout their lengthy piece, interviewing several self-identified Antifa activists.\u000a\u000aThe group\u2019s radical ideologies were downplayed in the sympathetic piece. Activists were given a direct line to explain their goals and beliefs, without fear of any criticism from CNN, in passages like these:\u000a\u000aAntifa activists, who operate without any centralized leadership, told CNN that their goal is peace and inclusivity. They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they've condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism.\u000a\u000aOn social media, many of the arrestees have posted anti-police messages and anarchist views. Some write that they feel disenfranchised in the current political climate, the CNN review found.\u000a\u000aLet's get one thing clear. Antifa is an Anarcho-Communist cause.

On Friday, Mnuchin explained that President Donald Trump had floated the idea of combining the bill with Veterans Affairs legislation and indicated that even if he doesn't get his wish for a clean bill, the government will increase its borrowing authority one way or another.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the president said was that his strong preference had been that when they passed the VA bill before they left, that they attached the debt ceiling to that so that we wouldn\u2019t be dealing with this in September,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I have said before, my strong preference is that we have a clean debt ceiling, but the most important issue the debt ceiling will be raised in September.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, in a tweet explaining his preference that lawmakers tie the debt ceiling to the VA bill for passage prior to August recess, Trump said debt ceiling approval \u201ccould have been so easy-now a mess!\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, Mnuchin went on to say that the White House and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are on the same page about getting that goal accomplished.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aIn an interview with The Financial Times released on Friday, National Economic Director Gary Cohn also addressed the imminent debt ceiling deadline, saying next month the burden will be on Congress to approve a bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecretary Mnuchin and I totally agree that we cannot be put in a position where we default \u2014 we cannot default. We have to pay our obligations. The debt ceiling stuff will be in September, so before [tax legislation].\u201d\u000a\u000aLawmakers have a tall to-do list come September. While the president hits the road to promote the GOP\u2019s tax reform agenda starting next week, Congress will be saddled with a slew of must-pass items before the onset of the new fiscal year in October.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do in September,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe have the debt ceiling, we have the continuing resolution to fund the government, we have a budget. Congress has a lot of work this month.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, White House officials seem to agree that the debt ceiling is number one on the priorities list.

Last year, the Motorcycle Industry Council reported that just over 371,000 new bikes had been bought \u2013 half of what was being rolled out of dealerships a decade earlier.\u000a\u000aIn 2003, only 25 percent of all U.S. riders were 50 or older. Just over a decade later, that rose to half and the populous is said to be aging ever since.\u000a\u000aBut along with gunning for the young adults, HD also is continuing to stay alive by revving toward the female market, the fast growing sector of new riders. Women made up just eight percent of the market share in 2009 and now stand at around 12 percent. In recent years, the company brought out \u201cUltra Low\u201d street cruiser models with shorter-to-reach handlebars and narrower grips to accommodate petite hands, and in 2013 they released the Street 500 \u2013 smaller, simpler and geared toward the start rider.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the brand\u2019s creatives maintain that it is all about being geared to neither gender, which has been its mandate long before the concept became ingrained in the modern lexicon. James pointed out that their bestseller for men \u2013 the Street Glide \u2013 has notoriously been and continues to be their bestseller for women.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have found that women ride for the same reasons that men do \u2013 to escape, for the fun, the freedom,\u201d James added. \u201cWe are about transcending genders.\u201d\u000a\u000aHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

However, school leaders informed moms and dads \u2013 they were not allowed to opt-out \u2013 and the state did not require them to notify parents.\u000a\u000aThe latest incident occurred during the first week of school when a first grader came across a classmate on the playground.

aVThe Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump Jr. in a highly scrutinized meeting last summer sought to distance herself Friday from the infamous anti-Trump dossier, following testimony from a Senate witness that she worked with the firm behind that document on a separate project.\u000a\u000aNatalia Veselnitskaya slammed the dossier as "cheap gossip," in an email sent in Russian to Fox News. Her translator sent an English version of the original message, which was reviewed and verified by Fox News.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I read some parts of this \u2018dossier\u2019 in the media I laughed,\u201d Veselnitskaya said. \u201cWhat kind of idiots does one have to take Americans for to think that they can believe that stupid and incompetent [and] absurd [dossier]?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same email, in a confusing passage, also seemed to both defend and question the co-founder of the firm behind the document.\u000a\u000aLast month, CEO of Hermitage Capital Bill Browder testified before a Senate committee that Veselnitskaya orchestrated a "smear campaign" against him as part of an effort to fight anti-Russia sanctions, working with the firm Fusion GPS and co-founder Glenn Simpson.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aFusion was the same company behind the anti-Trump dossier.\u000a\u000aThis detail was swiftly picked up by President Trump and his allies, who pointed to the alleged Fusion-Russia connection as proof Moscow was actually working against him in 2016 despite "collusion" claims.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aSimpson had employed former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in the project, which was crafted as opposition research in requests by unknown political rivals of Trump. The dossier was first made public when BuzzFeed published contents in January. Steele since has been ordered to give a deposition in the multi-million dollar libel case brought against the media outlet.\u000a\u000aSimpson and Fusion have refused to say who they were working for on the dossier case, claiming they must keep clients' identities confidential. Simpson met with Senate Judiciary Committee staff for hours on Tuesday behind closed doors as part of their investigation.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aFusion GPS told Fox News the firm is cooperating and turned over more than 40,000 documents to the staff for their review.\u000a\u000aHowever, the committee said the firm only turned over public headlines and thousands of blank pages.\u000a\u000a\u201cFusion\u2019s initial production of documents consisted solely of headlines from publicly available news reports and more than 7,500 pages of blank paper,\u201d committee spokesman Taylor Foy said after Simpson\u2019s interview. \u201cFusion eventually provided a copy of the same unverified dossier that\u2019s been publicly available since January, and a privilege log that raises more questions than it answers.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimpson's attorney did not respond to a previous Fox News inquiry on how the blank pages complied with the committee's request.\u000a\u000aIn her email to Fox News, Veselnitskaya said she was almost in \u201cshock\u201d when she learned Simpson was behind the compiling of the dossier.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only thing I can say is that what I read on BuzzFeed\u2014that is not something of Glenn\u2019s level, it\u2019s not his modus operandi, it\u2019s not his work,\u201d Veselnitskaya told Fox News. \u201cCheap gossip and tall tales\u2014that is diminishing for an investigator like Mr. Simpson.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimpson\u2019s attorney, Josh Levy, told Fox News in a statement this week that the firm is \u201cproud of the work it has conducted" and stands by it.\u000a\u000aBrowder, a champion of the Magnitsky Act\u2014a law passed in 2012 in the wake of Russian whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s death to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering\u2014has continued to publicly link Russia to Fusion GPS.\u000a\u000aIn a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Browder also said the dossier was undertaken \u201cat the same time\u201d the firm was working on the \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him.\u000a\u000aVeselnitskaya acknowledged the two projects coincided, while suggesting she only learned about the dossier later.\u000a\u000aTRUMP DOSSIER FIGURE QUESTIONED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ON CAPITOL HILL\u000a\u000aVeselnitskaya's name burst into the headlines after it was revealed she had a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The meeting, first reported in June of this year, fueled the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election which the Trump team denies.\u000a\u000aIn her email, Veselnitskaya acknowledged that Simpson's firm was hired by "our lawyers" from law firm Baker Hostetler, and looked into Browder's background in connection with his allegations against a client in a Magnitsky-related case. Veselnitskaya had worked on a U.S.-based case for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon, which was caught up in a Justice Department money laundering case.\u000a\u000aThe email renewed numerous allegations against Browder, questioning his motives.\u000a\u000aFusion GPS told Fox News Wednesday that they did work on the Prevezon case, but stressed that the Trump dossier was a separate project.\u000a\u000aBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

aVHurricane Harvey spawned tornadoes, flooding, fires and widespread power outages across southern Texas early Saturday.\u000a\u000aBehind the giant storm, the largest to hit Texas in more than a decade, production on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico remained halted, coastal refineries were idle and thousands of cruise ship customers waited offshore until their vessels were able to dock safely.\u000a\u000aA massive fire destroyed at least three homes on Bolivar Peninsula late Friday night, according to 12 News Now. More than 200,000 homes and businesses were reportedly without power.\u000a\u000aAt least 15,000 people aboard three Carnival Cruise Line ships scheduled to return to Galveston this weekend were delayed or detoured due to the hurricane. The Port of Galveston was closed on Friday.\u000a\u000aA statement from the Miami-based Carnival Cruise Line said the Carnival Freedom and Carnival Valor were at sea and would remain a safe distance from the hurricane.\u000a\u000aPetroleum companies evacuated personnel from 86 Gulf of Mexico platforms, according to the Oil & Gas Journal.\u000a\u000aBy the time Hurricane Harvey was downgraded to a Category 1 storm early Saturday, it had already delivered a 1-2 punch to the Gulf Coast of Texas, making landfall twice, with powerful wind gusts and the threat of catastrophic flooding.\u000a\u000aHarvey arrived late Friday south of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 storm, packing 130 mph winds. It made a second landfall about three hours later, according to the National Hurricane Center, and by dawn Saturday the eye of the storm was moving at about 6 mph.\u000a\u000aFloodwaters were expected to reach 6 to 12 feet above ground level along the coast, and as much as three feet of rain was expected in hardest-hit areas.\u000a\u000aRockport, a city of about 10,000 people, was especially hard hit. It saw damage to a senior center, high school and other structures.\u000a\u000a\u201cRight now we're still hunkered down and can't go anywhere,'' said Steve Sims, the volunteer fire chief in Rockport. \u201cWe've heard rumors of 1,000 different things, we can't confirm anything because we haven't seen anything. We know we've got a lot of problems, but we don't know what yet.''\u000a\u000aOn Friday, William McKeon, president and CEO of Houston-based TMC, told Fox News that it was all hands on deck.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re here hunkered down,\u201d McKeon said, added that he\u2019s \u201cnever surprised by the weather in Texas.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it wasn't the initial punch of the fierce storm that had McKeon worried.\u000a\u000a"The hurricane is elevating in strength over us," he said. "We're not so much concerned with the wind as we are with it stalling over us. It's daunting to think of how much rain we could get."\u000a\u000aHospitals as far as Austin, Texas, had evacuated patients ahead of Harvey, FOX7 Austin reported.

aVFor one reason or another, the time may come to seek a new job. It may be due to normal life transitions such as graduating from college, obtaining an advanced degree, the relocation of a spouse or a company goes out of business. Sometimes, it may be that the job itself is not a good fit or the organization did not turn out to be the kind of employer you expected. Most of the time, people leave a job because of an opportunity for advancement.\u000a\u000aHow we leave a job is as important as how we start one. At some point in the future, you are likely to need a reference from the current employer. Sometimes, if you work in the same industry, you may end up working with some of the same people or they might even be your client one day. Whatever the case, you want to leave a very positive impression. The following tips are the ones I have given my own children when the time has come to leave a job.\u000a\u000a1. Resign in person. This may seem obvious, but in this digital world, people sometimes feel it acceptable to email, text or phone in a resignation. If you want to remain well thought of, and you do, then schedule a time to talk to your boss to resign face-to-face.\u000a\u000a2. Submit a written letter of resignation following the face-to-face meeting. Even if you and your boss have a great relationship, it is beneficial to you to have a written record that you chose to leave on your own accord.\u000a\u000a3. Provide ample notice, which is customarily a minimum of two weeks. Your boss may choose to go ahead and send you on your way, but the respectful action is to give notice. If the boss wants you to work out your notice, give 100 percent until your exit is complete.\u000a\u000a4. Don't burn any bridges. This old cliché' is a good one to remember. Even if asked during an exit interview, don't bash the company or any of its employees. Offer positive statements about the better parts of your experience and constructive feedback on what might have made it better. Do so while maintaining the highest level of professionalism.\u000a\u000a5. Offer to train your successor. If the company hires someone to replace you before you leave, offer to help train the new employee. Again, the boss might decline the offer, but you will be more highly thought of by offering to help the organization continue to be successful.\u000a\u000a6. Ask your employer for a letter of recommendation or permission to list as a reference in the future.\u000a\u000a7. Thank your boss and your organization for the opportunity for their company. Even if you had a poor experience, you obtained experience on which to build for the future. Be grateful and gracious.\u000a\u000a8. Return all company property promptly. It hurts your reputation for the company to have to hunt you down to retrieve a security badge, parking pass, key or other company-issued equipment. Protect your own integrity by voluntarily providing as you leave. Only leave with personal items that are rightfully yours.\u000a\u000aLeaving well, without baggage, sets you up for success in the next opportunity. You can start your new job ready to go and ready to grow in the next chapter of your career.\u000a\u000aDee Ann Turner is Vice President, Enterprise Social Responsibility, for Chick-fil-A, Inc.

aVPutting together the perfect Insta-friendly pregnancy announcement is basically a competitive sport at this point. But not everyone sees the sometimes-challenging realities that come with pregnancy behind the scenes. Which is why one mom's honest\u2014and creative\u2014photos are finding an enthusiastic audience on Instagram.\u000a\u000a"I was taking pretty pictures of my family and stuff like that, but at one point, I was just portraying something I wasn't," 28-year-old Maya Vorderstrasse tells SELF.\u000a\u000a"I had just had a baby and I was pregnant again\u2014I felt horrible, I was very emotional, I was exhausted." The New Jersey\u2013based stay-at-home mom gave birth to her first daughter, Zoey, last summer. And when she became pregnant with her second daughter, she decided to let her feed get a little more real. "I said, 'You know what, let me just embrace my life and throw it out there,'" she says. "It's not possible that I'm the only person who doesn't fit into this 'perfect motherhood' scene."\u000a\u000aTo create the first photo in her new "honest" series, Vorderstrasse drew on her advertising background and included a letterboard explaining that she was dealing with a sciatica flare-up and a "wild bladder." From there, she began posting updates every other week, including not being able to see her feet, having an increased appetite, and, of course, just needing a freakin' nap.

aVHurricane Harvey\u2019s impact on U.S. oil production could extend beyond offshore platforms and Gulf Coast refineries. Extreme flooding threatens to bring Texas shale activity to a halt, and it may take weeks, if not months, before some shale fields can bounce back.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aForecasters are warning residents of life-threatening conditions from Hurricane Harvey, a slow-moving Category 2 storm. The National Hurricane Center said Friday it expects \u201ccatastrophic\u201d flooding across portions of south and southeastern Texas. Harvey is expected to make landfall by early Saturday as a Category 3 storm or higher.\u000a\u000aTexas is by far the largest oil producer in the U.S., and at least part of the oil-rich Eagle Ford shale formation lies in the projected path of the storm. ConocoPhillips (COP) said it suspended drilling in Eagle Ford and evacuated non-essential staff beginning Thursday.\u000a\u000aIf flooding is as bad as anticipated, some shale fields could be out of commission for up to two months, Price Futures Group senior market analyst Phil Flynn wrote in a blog post Friday. Flooding is expected to impact Eagle Ford shale fields and perhaps some parts of the Permian basin.\u000a\u000aMotorists across the U.S. might see a spike in gasoline prices following disruptions to offshore rigs, refineries, pipelines and terminals. Pump prices could jump 15 to 25 cents a gallon, Flynn said.\u000a\u000aSome refineries along the Texas coastline have already shut down in preparation for the storm, bracing for heavy rainfall that can flood refining units or even start fires. There are roughly 30 refineries near the Texas Gulf Coast that have the capacity to process approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil per day.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aValero said Friday completed the process of temporarily closing two refineries in Corpus Christi and Three Rivers. Flint Hills Resources, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, ceased operations at its Corpus Christi plants.

Phillips 66 closed its Freeport terminal, while the company\u2019s other Gulf Coast assets were operating normally as of midday Friday.\u000a\u000aBy Thursday, companies evacuated personnel from 39 oil and natural gas platforms that account for 9.6% of the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s oil output, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

aVBy Steve Kurtz, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), is perhaps the most powerful representative the Democrats have. When she speaks, it means something. And what she\u2019s been speaking about lately is that others shouldn\u2019t be speaking at all.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s frightening. One might expect extremists in her party to have trouble with the First Amendment, but it\u2019s alarming that the top Democrat in the House jumps on the bandwagon. Is this how most Democrats feel?\u000a\u000aThe National Park Service recently announced that a right-wing rally by the group Patriot Prayer can go forward Saturday at federally owned Crissy Field in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge.

aVThe White House has finally issued guidelines for the transgender military ban -- sending a two-and-a-half page memo to the Pentagon, directing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to enact the rules within six months. Officials familiar with the document told the Wall Street Journal that the regulations will ultimately allow Mattis to consider a service member's ability to deploy when deciding whether to give them the boot. They will also give the Pentagon the power to deny admittance to transgender military members -- and to halt spending on medical treatment regimens for those currently serving, the sources said. When weighing one's "deployability," Mattis will reportedly be looking at their ability to not only serve in a war zone, but also whether they can participate in exercises or live for months on a ship.\u000a\u000aSue Fulton, Former Army Captain and past President of SPART*A (an LGBT military organization), and General Jerry Boykin, Executive Vice President of Family Research Council joined the Todd Starnes Show today to engage in a lively debate about the transgender military ban.

aVWhile every choice comes with a consequence, the future could get a whole lot more peachy for oenophiliacs everywhere. Vino startup PureWine claims their latest purifying gadget will make it easier than ever to strip wine of headache-inducing compounds before it ever hits your lips.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe basically are a Brita filter for wine,\u201d company CEO David Meadows told The Dallas Morning News. Meadows, who received a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Michigan, founded PureWine three years ago with his son Derek in hopes of discovering a way to consume wine without fear of a hangover.\u000a\u000aCALIFORNIA'S LAGUNITAS BREWERY CREATES CANNABIS-INFUSED IPA\u000a\u000aA post shared by Drink Pure Wine (@drinkpurewine) on Jul 30, 2017 at 7:40pm PDT\u000a\u000aAccording to the company website, after much experimentation, the father-son duo discovered an effective way to removing sulfites and histamines from vino, and The Wand was born. In September, a one-bottle-use spout that fits wine bottles like a cork and filters vino as its poured is set to hit shelves, according to Meadows.\u000a\u000a10 CRAFT BEERS YOU NEED TO SIP BEFORE SUMMER ENDS\u000a\u000aUnpleasant reactions induced by wine drinking may be more common than you realize. According to the company\u2019s research, up to 75 percent of adult consumers experience headaches, flushed skin or nasal congestion after downing a glass or two.\u000a\u000a"I was able to drink two glasses of red wine and not develop a headache, which I hadn\u2019t been able to do in a long time, if ever," gushed product tester Jeryn Laengrich, thankful that the PureWine gadget was able to eliminate her hangover. However, experts are skeptical that the gadget is totally effective.\u000a\u000aFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\u000a\u000aMoving forward, more scientific research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of the product, said Matthew Feldman, a private-practice allergist at the Dallas Allergy and Asthma Center.\u000a\u000a"What they're claiming is that some of the side effects and intolerances to wine may be improved by removing histamines and sulfites, but that's technically not an allergy," he said.

aVAutumn 1944. World War II is nearly over in Europe but is escalating in the Pacific, where American soldiers face an opponent who will go to any length to avoid defeat. The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. Killing the Rising Sun takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, Killing Patton, and Killing Reagan, this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before.

aVNorth Korea fired three short-range missiles on Saturday -- all successful -- despite earlier reports suggesting failure, according to the U.S. military.\u000a\u000aSeoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the projectiles fired from the North's eastern coast flew about 155 miles. It said South Korea and U.S. militaries were analyzing the launch and didn't immediately provide more details.\u000a\u000aAccording to earlier reports, U.S. Pacific Command spokesman and Cmdr. David Benham suggested two North Korean missiles "failed in flight" while the third one had "blown up almost immediately."\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Pacific Command has since revised its evaluation of the missile launch, now reporting no missile failures -- in line with the South Korean military assessment.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aBenham said the missiles did not pose a threat to North America or U.S. military facilities on the U.S. territory of Guam. Earlier this month, North Korea created a tense standoff with the United States by threatening to lob some of its missiles toward Guam.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's presidential office held a National Security Council meeting to discuss the missiles, which are the first known launches since July, when the North successfully flight tested a pair of intercontinental ballistic missiles that analysts say could reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\u000a\u000aThe White House said President Donald Trump -- who has warned he would unleash "fire and fury" if the North continued its threats -- was briefed on the latest North Korean activity and "we are monitoring the situation."\u000a\u000aThe launch came five days after U.S. and South Korean forces began annual military exercises that the North claims are a rehearsal for war. Tensions on the peninsula generally ratchet up during the late summer maneuvers and a series of larger exercises held each spring.\u000a\u000aBefore the latest missile launches were confirmed, North Korean state media said that dictator Kim Jong Un inspected a special operation forces training of the country's army that simulated attacks on South Korean islands along the countries' western sea border in what appeared to be in response to the ongoing U.S.-South Korea war games.\u000a\u000aKim reportedly told his troops that they "should think of mercilessly wiping out the enemy with arms only and occupying Seoul at one go and the southern half of Korea."\u000a\u000aThe Korean Central News Agency said that the "target striking contest" involved war planes, multiple-rocket launchers and self-propelled guns that attacked targets meant to represent South Korea's Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong islands before special operation combatants "landed by surprise" on rubber boats.\u000a\u000aThe border islands have occasionally seen military skirmishes between the rivals, including a North Korean artillery barrage on Yeonpyeong in 2010 that left two South Korean marines and two civilians dead.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea had not launched any missiles since the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution imposing new sanctions against the rogue nation Aug. 5. Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson trumpeted the lack of "missile launches or provocative acts" by the North since the resolution was passed.\u000a\u000a"I am pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we\u2019ve not seen in the past," Tillerson said at the time.\u000a\u000aAt a campaign-style rally Tuesday in Phoenix, President Trump told the crowd that "I respect the fact that I believe [Kim Jong Un] is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much."\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, North Korean state media released photos appearing to show the designs of one or possibly two new missiles hanging on a wall behind Kim while he visited a plant that makes solid-fuel engines for the country's ballistic-missile program.\u000a\u000aIn response to North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons program, South Korea has been moving to strengthen its own capabilities, planning talks with the United States on raising the warhead limits on its missiles and taking steps to place additional launchers to a U.S. anti-missile defense system in the country's southeast.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea has also been testing new missiles of its own, including the 497 mile-range Hyunmoo-2. Although the missile has not been operationally deployed yet, it is considered a key component to the so-called "kill chain" pre-emptive strike capability the South is pursuing to cope with the North's growing nuclear and missile threat.\u000a\u000aFox News' Lukas Mikelionis, Lucas Tomlinson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

That strategy has limits.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy Seth Cropsey, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSunrise in Singapore on Aug. 20 came at 7:03. Nearly an hour and a half earlier, the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain \u2014named for Sen. John McCain\u2019s father and grandfather, both admirals\u2014collided with a Liberian-flagged tanker ship near the heavily traveled Strait of Malacca. Ten sailors died.\u000a\u000aThis was the fourth accident this year for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, headquartered in Yokosuka, Japan. In January a guided-missile cruiser, the USS Antietam, ran aground in a high tide and strong winds after dragging her anchor in Tokyo Bay. The Antietam\u2019s commanding officer was subsequently relieved and reassigned to a post at fleet headquarters.\u000a\u000aIn May the USS Lake Champlain, another cruiser, collided with a South Korean fishing vessel east of the Korean Peninsula. The Navy crew had tried to signal the fishermen, who neither had a radio nor responded to the ship\u2019s horn. No one was injured.\u000a\u000aThen in June the USS Fitzgerald, a guided-missile destroyer, suffered significant damage in a collision with a Philippine-flagged container ship in the busy approaches to Tokyo Bay. Seven American sailors died. After an investigation, the ship\u2019s commanding and executive officers were relieved.\u000a\u000aSpeculation that sabotage or hacking had anything to do with these accidents seems unfounded. Navy ships have personnel constantly at watch, both on and off the bridge, to spot nearby vessels and other potential dangers. Can Russia hack a sailor\u2019s eyes?

aVYou have probably heard the term Old School, but what you might not know is that there is a concentrated effort to tear that school down.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a values thing. The anti\u2013Old School forces believe the traditional way of looking at life is oppressive. Not inclusive. The Old School way may harbor microaggressions. Therefore, Old School philosophy must be diminished.\u000a\u000aThose crusading against Old School now have a name: Snowflakes. You may have seen them on cable TV whining about social injustice and income inequality. You may have heard them cheering Bernie Sanders as he suggested the government pay for almost everything. The Snowflake movement is proud and loud, and they don\u2019t like Old School grads.\u000a\u000aSo where are you in all this?\u000a\u000aDid you get up this morning knowing there are mountains to climb\u2015and deciding how you are going to climb them? Do you show up on time? Do you still bend over to pick up a penny? If so, you\u2019re Old School.\u000a\u000aOr did you wake up whining about safe spaces and trigger warnings? Do you feel marginalized by your college\u2019s mascot? Do you look for something to get outraged about, every single day, so you can fire off a tweet defending your exquisitely precious sensibilities? Then you\u2019re a Snowflake.\u000a\u000aSo again, are you drifting frozen precipitation? Or do you matriculate at the Old School fountain of wisdom?\u000a\u000aThis book will explain the looming confrontation so even the ladies on The View can understand it.\u000a\u000aTime to take a stand. Old School or Snowflake. Which will it be?

aVGeneral Motors will soon offer 12 models powered by diesel engines in the United States, but don\u2019t call them the dirty dozen. Despite the recent Volkswagen emissions scandal, and a quickening industry-wide shift toward electrification, GM sees a promising future for the technology.\u000a\u000aThe lineup covers a wide range of vehicles that already includes the Chevrolet Cruze, GM\u2019s heavy duty trucks and even the high performance off-road Chevy Colorado ZR2 pickup. But the newest entries have the potential to be the biggest-sellers.\u000a\u000aCHEVROLET COLORADO ZR2 TAKES FLIGHT:\u000a\u000aChevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain compact utility vehicles powered by diesel engines are on the way to showrooms now. They will be the only diesels and boast the highest highway fuel economy in the segment when they go on sale in a couple of weeks. The pair use the same 137 hp 1.6-liter turbodiesel engine as the Cruze, and get EPA ratings of 39 mpg highway (38 mpg AWD) and 32 mpg combined. Only the Nissan Rogue Hybrid has a better combined rating at 34 mpg, but it trails the GM models on the highway at 35 mpg. The Equinox can also go 577 miles between freeway fill-ups (592 miles for AWD models thanks to a larger tank.)\u000a\u000aGM\u2019s sales pitch is based largely on that highway efficiency, and the robust 240 lb-ft of torque that comes with it. By contrast, the standard 170 hp 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine has 203 lb-ft of torque, but only gets 32 mpg highway, while an optional 252 hp 2.0-liter engine cranks out 260 lb-ft of torque and a 29 mpg highway rating.\u000a\u000aDan Nicholson, GM Vice President Global Propulsion Systems, is confident there is a large and largely untapped market for diesel-powered light duty vehicles in the United States. He points to the success of the Colorado and GMC Canyon diesels, which make up about 10 percent of the sales for those two midsize pickups, along with studies that found 16 percent of compact crossover buyers would consider a diesel, which will represent nearly half a million of them by 2020.\u000a\u000aWhen asked if VW\u2019s woes have soured consumers on diesels, Nicholson said indications are that owners felt let down by the brand but don\u2019t blame the technology. They\u2019re still interested when it\u2019s done properly, and he stresses that the latest offerings from GM have had their emissions certified under the most rigorous federal scrutiny yet required.\u000a\u000aDuring a very short drive of the Equinox diesel on secondary roads, the engine felt as potent as advertised. The Equinox exhibited strong acceleration, and even a little torque steer in the front-wheel-drive model I was in when I floored the accelerator. GM claims the engine is roughly half as loud as the diesel in the Jaguar F-Pace, and it is nearly silent while cruising. Tucking the timing chain into the transmission bell housing at the back of the engine for added insulation was one clever way GM\u2019s engineers reduced some of the noise. However, it still makes a muffled, yet recognizable diesel clatter at idle and under load.\u000a\u000a(Super-short Equinox review: regardless of engine, I think it's one of the best vehicles in its class, which includes the Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue. It\u2019s very refined, has an excellent ride and plenty of room for passengers and cargo, plus lots of tech. The only thing missing is adaptive cruise control, although you can get it with automatic emergency brakes. The old Equinox was a strong-seller. This one definitely deserves to be.)\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t get to go far enough to get a read on fuel economy, but assistant chief engineer Mike Siegrist said he gets better than the EPA rating at sustained high speeds in the real world. That\u2019s often the case with diesel engines and likely to be true here.\u000a\u000aOne advantage the diesel Equinox doesn\u2019t have over the gas models is towing. Its official rating is the same as the 1.5-liter\u2019s at 1,500 pounds and well below the 2.0-liter\u2019s 3,500-pound max. Considering diesels are typically touted for their heavy hauling capability, this might seem counterintuitive, but the Equinox body doesn\u2019t deliver enough cooling airflow for the hotter-running diesel engine in the toughest tests. Nevertheless, Siegrist said that towing isn\u2019t a top concern for shoppers in this segment.\u000a\u000aAs for what they\u2019ll pay, the lowest priced diesel available is a mid-level Equinox LT, which starts at $31,435. The closest comparably-equipped Equinox with the 1.5-liter is $1,795 less, and the 2.0-liter $600 more (although both of those have a power liftgate that\u2019s valued at $400 and only available on the diesel through a much different configuration.)\u000a\u000aThe diesel will save the average driver $100 and $550 annually compared to each engine, respectively (minus an extra $15-$20 every 5,000-6,000 miles to refill the required diesel exhaust fluid that keeps it clean.) That\u2019s assuming 15,000 miles driven each year. If you do more of those on the highway, or the spread between gas and diesel prices where you live is smaller, the savings will be greater.\u000a\u000aUltimately, GM is offering a unique choice for a specific type of customer, not a silver bullet for all. If you're a long-hauler, but don't haul a whole lot, it could be the right one for you.\u000a\u000aGary Gastelu is FoxNews.com's Automotive Editor.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aAmerica's post World War II euphoria was shattered in the summer of 1950, when North Korean communist forces invaded democratic South Korea. The Korean campaign of 1950-1953 has been called the "Forgotten War." More than 1.7 million Americans served in Korea and over 35,000 of them died there fighting at places like "Bloody Ridge," "Pork Chop Hill" and "Heartbreak Ridge." These were the treacherous "hill battles" known for some of the most brutal combat in military history. They fought for hills that were sometimes smaller than a football field.\u000a\u000aIn this exciting episode of "War Stories with Oliver North," you'll meet some of the heroic men who survived this unbelievable carnage. You'll hear how one trapped soldier stacked frozen enemy torsos to protect himself from enemy artillery fire. And yet another soldier vividly remembers a face on a hill that haunts him today. And you'll meet the man who would later be portrayed by screen legend Gregory Peck in the classic war drama, "Pork Chop Hill."

aVBy MEGAN MCARDLE | Bloomberg View\u000a\u000aJames Damore, the author of the notorious Google memo, has had his 15 minutes of fame. In six months, few of us will be able to remember his name. But Google will remember \u2014 not the company, but the search engine. For the rest of his life, every time he meets someone new or applies for a job, the first thing they will learn about him, and probably the only thing, is that he wrote a document that caused an internet uproar.\u000a\u000aThe internet did not invent the public relations disaster, or the summary firing to make said disaster go away. What the internet changed is the scale of the disasters, and the number of people who are vulnerable to them, and the cold implacable permanence of the wreckage they leave behind.\u000a\u000aTry to imagine the Damore story happening 20 years ago. It\u2019s nearly impossible, isn\u2019t it? Take a company of similar scope and power to Google \u2014 Microsoft, say. Would any reporter in 1997 have cared that some Microsoft engineer she\u2019d never heard of had written a memo his co-workers considered sexist? Probably not. It was more likely a problem for Microsoft HR, or just angry water-cooler conversations.\u000a\u000aEven if the reporter had cared, what editor would have run the story? On an executive, absolutely \u2014 but a random engineer who had no power over corporate policy? No one would have wasted precious, expensive column inches reporting it. And if for some reason they had, no other papers would have picked it up. Maybe the engineer would have been fired, maybe not, but he\u2019d have gotten another job, having probably learned to be a little more careful about what he said to co-workers.\u000a\u000aCompare to what has happened in this internet era: The memo became public, and the internet erupted against the author, quite publicly executing his economic and social prospects. I doubt Damore will ever again be employable at anything resembling his old salary and status. (Unless maybe a supporter hires him to make a political statement.)

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages.

aVThe Treasury Department sanctioned 10 firms and six individuals this week for facilitating North Korea\u2019s proliferation activities, illicit financial transactions, and sanctions evasion. The list included five Chinese firms and one Chinese individual as well as a Russian firm and four Russian nationals. These new sanctions send a strong message to Beijing and Moscow that there will be consequences for their failure to enforce the sanctions they claim to support.\u000a\u000aThe new U.S. designations complement the UN sanctions adopted two weeks ago with support from China and Russia. In the past, Beijing and Moscow have supported UN actions in order to deter unilateral sanctions by the U.S., only to undercut UN measures as soon as American pressure diminished. The tactic apparently failed this time. Instead, Washington should complement robust U.S. sanctions with a diplomatic effort to build a coalition of likeminded countries (including South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany) to squeeze North Korea\u2019s revenue.\u000a\u000aA crucial element of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpeaceful pressure\u201d strategy is the shift from hoping for Beijing\u2019s cooperation to sanctioning Chinese companies, individuals, and banks that facilitate North Korea\u2019s sanctions evasion. In June, the Treasury Department identified Bank of Dandong as a conduit for illicit transactions with North Korea and a primary money laundering concern\u2014the first time the U.S. charged a mainland Chinese bank with laundering funds for Pyongyang. On the same day, Treasury sanctioned two Chinese individuals and a Chinese company for establishing front companies, conducting financial transactions, and shipping illicit luxury goods.\u000a\u000aThis newest round of sanctions will not have a meaningful impact unless the White House presses forward, sidelining those who perennially counsel that Beijing and Moscow respond best to carrots not sticks. Ten years of experiences shows that just isn\u2019t true.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the Treasury Department sanctioned Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Materials, which the innovative data-mining organization C4ADS first identified as the top Chinese importer from North Korea since 2014. C4ADS noted that Zhicheng accounted for 9.19 percent of North Korean exports to China in 2016.\u000a\u000aZhicheng imported more than $234 million worth of North Korean coal in 2016, according to a review of Chinese customs records. The Treasury Department confirmed that Zhicheng used proceeds from these sales to purchase other goods on behalf of North Korea, mirroring the approach used by another sanctioned Chinese company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development. Earlier this month, the UN Security Council finally imposed a complete ban on the export of coal from North Korea.\u000a\u000aA recently unsealed late May order from the District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Justice Department\u2019s request for \u201cdamming\u201d seizure warrants that enabled the confiscation of funds destined for eight U.S. banks from accounts controlled by Zhicheng\u2019s owner, Chi Yupeng, who was designated along with his firm. The Justice Department said the Chi Yupeng network processed $700 million through the U.S. financial system from 2009 to May 2017. The Justice Department filed a complaint on August 21 requesting the forfeiture of over $4 million that a Zhicheng front company processed through the U.S. financial system on June 21.\u000a\u000aAnother one of Tuesday\u2019s designations entails the explosive charge that a Chinese national has been operating a North Korean bank on Chinese soil. In that regard, the Treasury Department announced sanctions on Mingzheng International Trading Limited, describing it as a front for Pyongyang\u2019s primary foreign exchange provider, the UN- and U.S.-sanctioned Foreign Trade Bank (FTB). Treasury previously sanctioned Mingzheng\u2019s owner, Sun Wei, on June 29. Earlier that month, the Justice Department filed an asset forfeiture complaint requesting over $1.9 million in proceeds processed through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Mingzheng from October to November 2015. A confidential source told Justice that Mingzheng made illicit financial transactions on behalf of the North Korean government between January 2012 and January 2015. A second confidential source revealed that Mingzheng acts as a front company for a covert branch of FTB operated by a Chinese national.\u000a\u000aAnother Chinese company, Dandong Rich Earth Trading Co. Ltd., was sanctioned Tuesday for supporting North Korean entities tied to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. According to Treasury, the company purchased vanadium ore from Korea Kumsan Trading Corporation. The UN restricted North Korean exports of vanadium ore in March 2016, so this designation highlights Beijing\u2019s lax enforcement of UN sanctions, while indicating the U.S. will no longer turn a blind eye.\u000a\u000aWhile China is Kim Jong Un\u2019s main patron and facilitator, no effective sanctions regime can ignore the role of Russian actors, which were targeted for the second time since June. Russia\u2019s Gefest-M LLC and its director were designated Tuesday for procuring metals for Korea Tangun Trading Corporation\u2019s Moscow office; Tangun was designated by the U.S. in 2009 for its involvement in North Korea\u2019s WMD and missile programs. In early June, Treasury designated another Russian company and individual for providing supplies to Tangun and noted the individual is a frequent business partner of Tangun officials in Moscow. Russia should shut down the Tangun office in Moscow immediately.\u000a\u000aThree Russian individuals and their two Singapore-based companies were also sanctioned Tuesday for providing oil to North Korea. In early June, Treasury sanctioned a Russian company, Independent Petroleum Company (IPC), and its subsidiary for signing a contract to provide oil to North Korea and shipping over $1 million in petroleum products to North Korea. The Justice Department, in an August 21 complaint, alleged that North Korean banks used one of the Singapore-based companies, Transatlantic Partners Pte. Ltd., to make U.S. dollar payments to the other Singapore-based company, Velmur, to pay Russia\u2019s IPC. Justice asked a federal judge to authorize the forfeiture of almost $7 million wired to Velmur in May 2017.\u000a\u000aThese actions against Singapore-based front companies are a reminder that the U.S. also notices when its allies fail to do their part. Singapore in particular has been host to sanctions evaders, yet partners in Western Europe and the Persian Gulf are also responsible for some glaring oversights.\u000a\u000aThe one element missing from Tuesday\u2019s action is the designation of Chinese banks that facilitate North Korea\u2019s illicit financial transactions. Chinese banks are integral to the operation of these illicit networks and the Trump administration will need to target them to move its pressure campaign to the next level. The Treasury Department has the power to issue significant fines against Chinese banks that are not doing enough to stop illicit North Korean financial transactions. While Justice\u2019s requests to seize illicit funds are important, it is more effective to target the source.\u000a\u000aA robust sanctions campaign against Pyongyang will require many more designations to chip away at North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs. This newest round of sanctions will not have a meaningful impact unless the White House presses forward, sidelining those who perennially counsel that Beijing and Moscow respond best to carrots not sticks. Ten years of experiences shows that just isn\u2019t true. China and Russia must stop North Korea\u2019s sanctions evasion or face severe consequences.\u000a\u000aAnthony Ruggiero, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, was the non-proliferation advisor to the U.S. delegation to the 2005 rounds of the Six-Party Talks and spent more than 17 years in the U.S. government.

aVAudi has inked a deal with solar panel expert Alta Devices to fit the energy-generating panels to the roofs of its future cars.\u000a\u000aAlta Devices, based in California, is renowned for its highly efficient solar panels. It will work with Audi to develop thin, lightweight solar cells that can be integrated into the panoramic glass roofs commonly found on cars. The first prototype should be ready in late 2017. Later, the two firms will develop solar cells that will be able to line a car\u2019s entire roof surface.\u000a\u000aAudi will initially fit the solar roofs to its electric cars. The generated energy won\u2019t be able to add range directly, however. Audi says the energy will only be used to power ancillaries like the air conditioner or seat heaters, thus saving that little bit of extra energy to increase range.\u000a\u000aEventually, though, the solar roofs will be able to directly charge the main battery, Audi promises. Such a system features on the Fisker Karma and its rebranded successor, the Karma Revero. We\u2019re not talking much range. Given the limited space, a couple of miles of range will likely require at least a week of maximum sunshine.\u000a\u000aAudi\u2019s first volume electric car will be the e-tron SUV due in 2018. It will be joined shortly after by the coupe-like e-tron Sportback. Both models will be built at a plant in Belgium and offer a range of at least 250 miles.

Now, the GOP was Islamophobic and reducing Americans to skin color caricatures.\u000a\u000aIn 2006, the same.\u000a\u000aIn 2008, if you didn\u2019t vote for Barack Obama, you were racist and probably a fascist because John McCain was a war hero bigot.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, the Tea Party was racist and the proof was the union protestors who dressed up as Nazis to smear the Tea Party groups.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Mitt Romney was a Mormon and everyone is supposed to know Mormons are bigots, racists, and creepy. Oh, and he is a Republican and Republicans are racist.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the same.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Donald Trump is a racist. Never mind that he did better than Romney with both Hispanic and black voters.\u000a\u000aNow?\u000a\u000aHoward Dean says if you vote Republican, you are a racist.\u000a\u000aIn 2017, a number of Democrats have begun admitting that they cried wolf for years and years. They inappropriately labeled other Republicans racist and fascist and in 2016 no one believed them about Trump.\u000a\u000aLooks like they really learned nothing at all.

aVBy Charles Hurt - The Washington Times\u000a\u000aANALYSIS/OPINION:\u000a\u000aBecause, of course, they want rule of law to reign, a group of citizens began digging up the grave of Nathan Bedford Forrest in Memphis this week over his helping found the Ku Klux Klan.\u000a\u000aThey only got a few shovelfuls before giving up. But they vowed to return with a backhoe to dig the rest of the man\u2019s grave up later.\u000a\u000aLegally speaking, this would be called \u201cgrave robbing\u201d and \u201cvandalism,\u201d and might even violate a few of God\u2019s laws, as well. But none of that matters to vigilantes in pursuit against racism and racist racists who practice it.\u000a\u000aReal guts, these fine people have, to take a stand against something so popular as racism. Yeah, it\u2019s right up there with gonorrhea, syphilis, flesh-eating amoebas and child rape. Good old red-white-and-blue racism.\u000a\u000aBut there is a method to this nihilistic madness. Without \u201cracist America,\u201d you would not have the political party known as Democrats. Its entire existence, every dime it raises, every position it takes is based on this century-old cliche that somehow America \u2014 the country that invented freedom and self-governance \u2014 is still totally racist.\u000a\u000aTheir leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 a full decade after she became Speaker of the House \u2014 is shocked \u2014 SHOCKED, I SAY!!! \u2014 to find that there are Confederate statues all throughout the Capitol building where she has worked for more than a quarter-century.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026. [to] what's right for you," such as narrow or wide, Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aParents can turn off the camera if they choose to monitor only the sound. Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted. Parents can dress up Arlo Baby to look like a rabbit (with snap-on ears and feet) , a Dalmatian, or a cat.\u000a\u000aIt also records video, so busy parents don't have to miss milestones like their baby\u2019s first words or first steps.\u000a\u000a"If one parent is on the road, you can use your smartphone and get access to a live feed from the camera, and type in your password to get into the app and see what baby's doing at any time of the day," Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aUsers can talk to their babies when they\u2019re away, thanks to the monitor\u2019s two-way audio. Speak into your smartphone, and your baby will hear your voice on the monitor\u2019s speaker.\u000a\u000aThe camera can also be used to record or live-stream nannies and babysitters.\u000a\u000a"The most important thing you can protect is your family,\u201d Falgiano said, \u201cso being able to have tools to help monitor the child\u2026 and have it all tied in to [a smartphone experience] you're already using\u2026 we thought it made sense to bring that experience all together."

aVPresident Donald Trump signed a new executive order on Friday, imposing new financial sanctions on President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe President\u2019s new action prohibits dealings in new debt and equity issued by the government of Venezuela and its state oil company. It also prohibits dealings in certain existing bonds owned by the Venezuelan public sector, as well as dividend payments to the government of Venezuela.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe new sanctions prohibit banks from fostering new deals, including those involving debt and equity, with the government and the country\u2019s state-run oil company, PDVSA.\u000a\u000aUnder the order, the Treasury Department intends to cut off financing to the \u201cillegitimate\u201d Maduro government. However, it will issue licenses allowing for a 30-day wind down period, financing for most commercial trade \u2013 including petroleum transactions involving Citgo \u2013 dealings in select existing Venezuelan debts and funding for humanitarian efforts. The purpose of these general licenses is to limit harm passed on to the Venezuelan and American people, the White House said.\u000a\u000aThe sanctions have been issued in response to Maduro\u2019s decision to create a National Constituent Assembly with powers to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution. Earlier this month, that body declared its powers superior to all other branches of government.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe regime\u2019s decision to create an illegitimate Constituent Assembly\u2014and most recently to have that body usurp the powers of the democratically-elected National Assembly\u2014represents a fundamental break in Venezuela\u2019s legitimate constitutional order,\u201d Sanders said.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Treasury Department issued financial sanctions on individuals in the run-up to, and aftermath of, the election of the National Constituent Assembly, including against Maduro himself. President Trump promised swift economic action on behalf of the United States if Maduro followed through with that election, which was viewed by the administration as a blatant suppression of democracy and human rights.

aVAs Hurricane Harvey made landfall late Friday, many eyes in Texas and beyond were upon William "Brock" Long, the man appointed by President Donald Trump to head FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u000a\u000aMany were also watching Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as emergencies on the scale of Harvey require communication and coordination between state and federal agencies.\u000a\u000aHarvey, a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130 mph, could become one of the most powerful storms to hit Texas in more than a decade.\u000a\u000aLong, a former FEMA regional manager who also once headed Alabama\u2019s emergency management operation, is an experienced civil servant known for a steady hand in mitigating natural disasters.\u000a\u000aAt a White House briefing Friday, Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert expressed full confidence in Long, calling him \u201cthe top of the top.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve known Administrator Long now for 15 years. We couldn\u2019t have picked a finer leader. He\u2019s had state director experience. He\u2019s had FEMA experience. He\u2019s absolutely the top of the top,\u201d Bossert told reporters.\u000a\u000aUnlike some of his predecessors at FEMA, Long has been involved in disaster relief for most of his career. In 1999 he was a statewide planner at Georgia\u2019s Emergency Management Agency, then in 2001 became a regional manager at FEMA under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aAfter four years at FEMA, Long became director of Alabama\u2019s Emergency Management Agency, where he guided efforts to relieve areas affected by tornadoes and a BP oil spill.\u000a\u000aHis successful directorship in Alabama drew bipartisan praise. Barry Scanlon, a former senior FEMA official under President Clinton, said Long is well-respected among people working in disaster relief.\u000a\u000a"He's got the relationships throughout emergency management, throughout the states," Scanlon told NPR. "He has the respect of the people who do this every day, which is vitally important."\u000a\u000aPerhaps it is not surprising that Long\u2019s nomination by Trump to become FEMA director met with little resistance. The Senate confirmed his nomination in June by a 95-4 vote.\u000a\u000a"The combination of his work for FEMA, state emergency management, and the private sector makes Brock Long well suited for this nomination by the president,\u201d U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said in June. \u201cBecause of his experience, Brock understands it is the work done before a storm that saves lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aLong is one of the few Trump appointees who has been celebrated by environmentalists who see danger in not responding to climate change, New York magazine reported.\u000a\u000aThe FEMA chief also came out in support of cutting federal government coverage for flood-prone homes so that local authorities could take responsibility, Bloomberg reported.\u000a\u000aBut while Long remains an important figure in containing Hurricane Harvey, Texans were also looking to Abbott, a first-term Republican who took office in January 2015.\u000a\u000aAbbott received some help from the White House on Friday, when President Trump declared Texas a disaster area. The move helps provide Texas with federal funding for emergency response efforts.\u000a\u000aAbbott, meanwhile, activated around 700 National Guard members shortly before Harvey made a landfall. In a statement, he assured Texans that all levels of government were working together to mitigate the effects of the hurricane.\u000a\u000aAccording to the National Hurricane Center, floodwaters resulting from Hurricane Harvey could reach as high as 12 feet above ground level along the Gulf Coast of Texas and around 3 feet of rain could fall in the most-affected areas.\u000a\u000aThe National Weather Service Forecast Office in Corpus Christi warned that the hurricane\u2019s impact could range from \u201cstructural damage to sturdy buildings\u201d to \u201ccomplete destruction of mobile homes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLocations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\u201d it added.\u000a\u000aIt was clear as Harvey made landfall that both FEMA\u2019s Long and Gov. Abbott had plenty of work ahead of them.

aVBy Steve Kurtz, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), is perhaps the most powerful representative the Democrats have. When she speaks, it means something. And what she\u2019s been speaking about lately is that others shouldn\u2019t be speaking at all.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s frightening. One might expect extremists in her party to have trouble with the First Amendment, but it\u2019s alarming that the top Democrat in the House jumps on the bandwagon. Is this how most Democrats feel?\u000a\u000aThe National Park Service recently announced that a right-wing rally by the group Patriot Prayer can go forward Saturday at federally owned Crissy Field in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge. Pelosi calls members of the group white supremacists (though they say they support peace, love and unity). While the group is controversial, the right of its members to speak shouldn\u2019t be.\u000a\u000aBut it sure is to Pelosi, whose grip on the First Amendment appears a bit shaky. This is from her statement on the National Park Service decision:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn San Francisco, we have great reverence for the Constitutional right to dissent and peaceful free speech,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHowever, free speech does not grant the right to yell fire in a crowded theater, incite violence or endanger the public in any venue. As we ponder where and by whom the ill-conceived decision to approve this permit in a national park was made, we must all pray it does not become an invitation to incite violence.\u201d

aVAs eastern Texas dealt with the arrival of Hurricane Harvey, two Houston professional sports teams \u2013 baseball\u2019s Astros and football\u2019s Texans \u2013 prepared for the possibility that upcoming games might have to be postponed or relocated.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Houston\u2019s two pro soccer teams weren\u2019t waiting to make a decision. The Houston Dynamo men\u2019s team and Houston Dash women\u2019s team quickly rescheduled their upcoming matches.\u000a\u000aThe Dynamo of Major League Soccer had been scheduled to play Saturday night against Sporting Kansas City at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston. That match will now be played Oct. 11, according to the Dynamo and Dash\u2019s joint website.\u000a\u000aThe Dash of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League had been scheduled to play Sunday night against the North Carolina Courage, also at BBVA Compass Stadium. No new date has been set for that game, the Houston team said.\u000a\u000a­\u201cThe most important thing is the safety of our community,\u201d Dynamo and Dash President Chris Canetti said on the teams' website.\u000a\u000aThis weekend the Astros are playing in Anaheim, Calif., against the Los Angeles Angels. But they are expected to return to Houston on Tuesday for three games against the Texas Rangers and three against the New York Mets.\u000a\u000aEven if the Astros\u2019 home field, Minute Maid Park, avoids storm damage, the possibility exists that games could be canceled because teams and fans might not be able to travel to the stadium.\u000a\u000aOne option, of course, would be for the Astros to switch their games against Texas to the Rangers\u2019 home in Arlington, much farther inland than Houston. But as of early Saturday neither the Astros, Rangers nor Major League Baseball had announced contingency plans.\u000a\u000a\u201cRight now, we\u2019re keeping an eye on it because it could go so many different directions,\u201d Rangers traveling secretary Josh Shelton told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a wait-and-see.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NFL\u2019s Texans, meanwhile, were scheduled to play in New Orleans on Saturday night against the Saints.

aVThe alleged attack on U.S. State Department officials in Cuba has made weapons that use sound a national conversation.\u000a\u000aAcoustic weapons are not just in the arsenals of countries unfriendly to America. The U.S. military and American companies have developed some of the best of this kind of sonic weaponry.\u000a\u000aLike rubber bullets, acoustic weapons tend to fall within the category of \u201cnon lethals\u201d or \u201cless lethals.\u201d The general idea is that they exploit the sense of hearing to apply force in a way that will stop a target, but without causing permanent harm or taking a life.\u000a\u000aSONIC WEAPONS REPORTED IN CUBA: COULD SOUND BE HARNESSED IN AN ATTACK?\u000a\u000aThe LRAD sound cannon is one of the better-known acoustic weapons designed to disperse crowds or disable a hostile target. It emits bursts of loud, irritating sounds that can discourage violent behavior.\u000a\u000aAside from being annoyed from an ear walloping, those targeted can also experience effects like headaches and nausea.\u000a\u000aSound as ammo\u000a\u000aSince acoustic weapons use sound, these weapons deliver what could be described as \u201cinvisible\u201d attacks.\u000a\u000aOne interesting twist in acoustic weaponry is Raytheon\u2019s research into a "sonic shield." Towards the end of 2011, Raytheon filed a very interesting patent for this weapon.\u000a\u000aGIGANTIC BATTLE OF THE TANKS IS GOING ON IN RUSSIA\u000a\u000aBoth shield and weapon\u000a\u000aThe Sonic Shield looks and functions like the riot shield that military and law enforcement use - but this shield is also a weapon.\u000a\u000aTypically, acoustic weapons use sound against a target\u2019s sense of hearing. But rather than target the ear, this acoustic weapon targets the lungs.\u000a\u000aIt would unleash this invisible \u201cammo\u201d in a way that can cause the sensation of suffocation. So if you were a target, you would suddenly have a sense of suffocation but have no idea what was causing it \u2013 because the beam can not be seen.\u000a\u000aThe user can choose the intensity and unleash the invisible acoustic \u201cammo\u201d at a level meant to warn and deter through to one intended to \u201ctemporarily incapacitate.\u201d\u000a\u000aBlasting wall of sound\u000a\u000aAccording to the patent, Raytheon also aimed for a bunch of shields to be able to coordinate and work together to deliver a wall of sound.\u000a\u000aThe networked shields would provide a powerful combined beam. One shield could be designated as the lead or "master" shield, with the others being subserviant. The master shield would direct and coordinate the beam patterns.\u000a\u000aA team of shields would deliver a more sophisticated beam with better power, range than the capabilities of a single shield.\u000a\u000aFor example, they could be used to create a more effective perimeter in a large riot scenario when trying to contain a dangerous situation.\u000a\u000aHow does it work?\u000a\u000aThe sonic shield looks and functions like a riot shield. It is a fortified \u201cshell\u201d with one side for the user and the other to face the target.\u000a\u000aThere is an acoustic horn as well as a sonic pulse generator built into the physical shell of the shield. This sonic pulse generator creates the acoustic pulses that blast out through the horn directed at the target.\u000a\u000aWhen the user fires, the shield triggers the sonic pulse generator to generate a shot. The shot can include a burst of multiple pulses at a repetition rate fixed (or varied) for each of three settings: Warn, Stun or Incapacitate.\u000a\u000aThe shield could also be equipped with a sensor that measures the distance to the target. If the target moves, then the weapon could automatically adjust to maintain the same pressure.\u000a\u000aNEW RUSSIAN STEALTH FIGHTER JET REVEALED\u000a\u000aHeads up display for targeting\u000a\u000aFrom behind the shield, the user can manage targeting and firing using a Heads Up Display (HUD). It could provide visual targeting, beam width and other data to the operator.\u000a\u000aThe HUD, for example, could provide color-coded \u201ctarget-of-interest\u201d dots indicating how effective a blast would be.\u000a\u000aIt could tell the user which target is closest and warn if a target is moving out of range.\u000a\u000aThe patent also details another targeting option, head-tracking goggles.

aVThough Princess Diana is gone, she is far from forgotten -- worldwide tributes are expected later this month for the 20th anniversary of the death of \u201cThe People\u2019s Princess.\u201d\u000a\u000aDiana Frances Spencer was just 36 years old when she died in 1997 at a Paris hospital following a car crash.\u000a\u000aThe crash took place early on Aug. 31, 1997, in Paris, France, after Diana and her boyfriend, 42-year-old Dodi Fayed, had left the Ritz in the French capital.\u000a\u000aThere were four people traveling in a Mercedes S280: driver Henri Paul, who was the acting head of security for the Ritz, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, the front passenger, and Diana and Fayed in the backseat.\u000a\u000aWhile attempting to elude paparazzi, the Mercedes hit a pillar in the Pont d\u2019Alma tunnel. Fayed and Paul both died at the scene. Diana was taken to a hospital, where she died around 4 a.m. Rees-Jones was injured yet survived.\u000a\u000aBoth French and British authorities determined the crash to be an accident.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe vehicle's driver was in a state of drunkenness and under the influence of medication incompatible with alcohol, a state that prevented him from keeping control of his vehicle when he was driving at high speed,\u201d French magistrates wrote in a 1999 judicial report.\u000a\u000aIn the United Kingdom, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Paget, a probe into the incident, began in 2004. The Paget report, which was more than 800 pages long and examined conspiracy claims, was published in December 2006.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur conclusion is that, on all the evidence available at this time, there was no conspiracy to murder any of the occupants of the car. This was a tragic accident,\u201d Lord John Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner who led the inquiry, wrote in an overview.\u000a\u000aAn inquest took place in the U.K. from October 2007 until April 2008, when a jury ruled that Diana and Fayed were unlawfully killed through the reckless actions of their driver and paparazzi. The jury added that the fact Diana and Fayed were not wearing seat belts was a contributing factor to their deaths.\u000a\u000aPRINCESS DIANA HAD 'A LONELY MISERABLE LIFE INSIDE THE PALACE,' BIOGRAPHER CLAIMS\u000a\u000aDespite the official rulings, conspiracy theories surrounding Diana\u2019s death have persisted for years. Here are some of the popular ones.\u000a\u000aPrince Philip allegations\u000a\u000aDodi Fayed\u2019s father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, has claimed that Diana and Dodi were killed in a plot that was \u201carranged for or carried out\u201d by security services on behalf of Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, the Paget report said.\u000a\u000aThe motive, according to the report, would have been Diana being pregnant with Dodi Fayed\u2019s child and that their engagement would soon be announced.\u000a\u000aNo proof of a connection between Prince Philip and the Secret Intelligence Service -- also known as MI6 -- was found in the Stevens inquiry, according to the BBC. Diana also wasn\u2019t found to have been engaged or pregnant.\u000a\u000aWhile leading the inquest, coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker rejected the conspiracy theory, and instructed the jury there was no evidence to support Al-Fayed\u2019s claims the couple were victims of a murder plot directed by Prince Philip and carried out by British secret agents. The jury was not at liberty to disagree.\u000a\u000aFormer MI6 officer's claims\u000a\u000aFormer MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson told a newspaper following the car crash that Diana\u2019s crash was similar to a supposed assassination plot against Serbian politician Slobodan Milosevic which involved a flashing light and a tunnel, the Guardian reported.\u000a\u000aStevens wrote in his Paget overview that \u201cwe are confident that any theories concerning flashing lights inside the Alma underpass can be discounted as the cause of this crash.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Stevens-led inquiry also found the former spy\u2019s allegation that a flash blinded Diana\u2019s driver Henri Paul to have been incorrect, according to the BBC.\u000a\u000aTomlinson later gave testimony during the inquest, and reportedly acknowledged he may have gotten details of the supposed plan incorrect.\u000a\u000aFormer MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove also testified during the inquest, denying that MI6 killed Diana. Dearlove said there hadn\u2019t been a plot to kill Milosevic, saying that there had been one against another Balkan leader, and that the plan was \u201ckilled stone dead,\u201d according to the BBC.\u000a\u000aPRINCESS DIANA'S SHOCKING RECORDINGS DEFENDED BY UK BROADCASTER\u000a\u000aThe Fiat Uno\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe there was a glancing contact between the Mercedes, driven by Henri Paul, and a white Fiat Uno just before the Alma underpass,\u201d Stevens wrote in his overview. The Fiat Uno, however, has never been recovered.\u000a\u000aStevens dismissed claims that a French photojournalist named James Andanson had been driving the vehicle and was a security services agent.\u000a\u000aAndanson owned a white Fiat Uno, but had been with his wife at home the night of Aug. 30, 1997, and there wasn\u2019t evidence that he\u2019d been with the security services, Stevens wrote.\u000a\u000aAndanson was later found in a burned-out vehicle in France in 2000, according to the Independent. French authorities determined it was a suicide, which Stevens said British authorities agreed with.\u000a\u000aTwo inquest witnesses would identify the white Fiat Uno driver as Vietnamese-born French citizen Le Van Thanh, according to the Telegraph.\u000a\u000aThanh sprayed his car red hours after the incident, his father Francois alleged to the Daily Mail in 2006.\u000a\u000aThanh didn\u2019t attend the inquest, but has denied that he was the Fiat Uno driver, the newspaper reported. Stevens tried twice this year to contact Thanh, but Thanh has reportedly refused to speak with him.\u000a\u000aStevens told the Daily Mail, \u201cWhat we have said to Mr. Thanh is, \u2018We believe you were the driver of the Fiat. Talk us through what happened.\u2019 We don\u2019t blame him for the accident. My Paget report said that a Fiat Uno was involved but was not the cause of the crash. We are still trying to interview him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

So I didn\u2019t want Vivi or Bubby to feel like they wish they had another sibling.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor now, Decker is focusing on another pregnancy \u2014 that of her younger sister Sydney, who is currently expecting.\u000a\u000aBubbys face sums up how I feel right now! #Mood missing daddy \U0001f629#waybackwednesday #wemissyou #footballcamp #footballfamily A post shared by Jessie James Decker (@jessiejamesdecker) on Aug 9, 2017 at 4:46pm PDT\u000a\u000a\u201cI gave Sydney everything,\u201d said Decker on sharing her collection of maternity wear. \u201cI have boxes of maternity stuff and I went through everything and I just kept going, \u2018Oh my God, these are the best\u2026 no, these are the best.

aVBy Rowan Scarborough - The Washington Times\u000a\u000aA new face of the Islamic State is a 10-year-old American boy the terror army claims came to Syria two years ago with his mother from the United States.\u000a\u000aIn a new ISIL propaganda video, the boy is identified as an American citizen named \u201cYusuf\u201d and says he is the son of a U.S. service member who deployed to Iraq.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis battle is not going to end in Raqqa or Mosul. It\u2019s going to end in your lands,\u201d the boy says.\u000a\u000aHe looks straight at the camera lens to deliver an anti-Donald Trump diatribe, speaking in what sounds like Americanized English.

aVJournalists and pundits claim they to want to tamp down national anger. Then they turn around and push the most dangerous rhetoric I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime \u2013 the absurd claim that President Trump is mentally unstable.\u000a\u000aClaims about alleged Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Trump campaign haven\u2019t succeeded at unseating President Trump, though that was the intention of many journalists.\u000a\u000aSo the news media used the events in Charlottesville to move on \u2013 to racism, blaming President Trump for every real or perceived racial slight in the nation. Essentially, a complete reversal from how they treated President Obama.\u000a\u000aRemember, President Obama was a \u201cuniter,\u201d we were told. That meant the racial strife in America\u2019s cities wasn\u2019t blamed on him. Riots in Baltimore and Ferguson weren\u2019t blamed on him. The failure of leaders in many of America\u2019s cities wasn\u2019t blamed on him, even though most of those cities were run by Obama\u2019s own political party \u2013 the Democrats.\u000a\u000aBaltimore is less than half the distance to Washington that Charlottesville is, and yet the media avoided connecting Baltimore\u2019s problems to Obama in any way.\u000a\u000aNow, Trump gets blamed for every bit of racism in America 2017. And that still isn\u2019t enough.\u000a\u000aThe news media are promoting a far more dangerous assault. This is the centerpiece of the campaign to oust the president. This isn\u2019t resistance. That\u2019s old-fashioned. Now, we have a small group of politicians and media types pushing a claim that Trump needs to go because he suffers from mental illness.\u000a\u000aTwo senators helped set this nonsense in motion with an \u201caccidental\u201d hot mic moment. Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island both called President Trump crazy back in July.\u000a\u000aFormer national intelligence director James Clapper, who most people couldn\u2019t pick out of a line-up, has been furthering this claim as well. He questioned President Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness to be in this office,\u201d and \u201cthe access to the nuclear codes\u201d during a CNN appearance.\u000a\u000aCNN hyped that nuclear fear, even tweeting out an image of the nuclear football with the caption: \u201c240 seconds: That\u2019s how long it could take for President Trump to launch a nuclear attack.\u201d Roughly the same time it would have taken President Obama, I imagine, but CNN wasn\u2019t at war with him.\u000a\u000aJournalists have taken the allegations about the president\u2019s mental health and done everything but turned the CNN set into a giant shrink\u2019s couch. \u201cReliable Sources\u201d host Brian Stelter embraced the topic like he was playing the role of \u201cThe President\u2019s Analyst.\u201d (The movie version was far better.)\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s just a tiny bit of Stelter\u2019s unhinged concern trolling about journalists\u2019 conversations that are being had \u201cusually after the microphones are off.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cQuestions that often feel out of bounds, off limits, too hot for TV. Questions like these: Is the president of the United States a racist? Is he suffering from some kind of illness? Is he fit for office? And if he's unfit, then what?\u201d Stelter asked. I guess they weren\u2019t too hot for TV, unless CNN is embracing global warming.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s the truth: This is CNN\u2019s revenge on the president who keeps attacking the news channel. Trump criticizes CNN for becoming a national embarrassment to journalism. CNN responds, claiming he\u2019s undermining democracy.\u000a\u000aBut in fact, CNN\u2019s response does more to undermine democracy than all of President Trump\u2019s media criticism. Because the answer CNN wants everyone to reach is that the president is unfit and must be removed. This is Stelter battling coworkers Jim Acosta and Don Lemon for the mantle of The Most Irresponsible Journalist in America.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s quite the battle.\u000a\u000aLemon, chimed in during another program, repeating the allegation, calling Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d and a person who had \u201cno sanity there.\u201d In yet another appearance, he was joined by Republican political consultant and wild anti-Trumper Rick Wilson, who launched into the theme of the week.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a man who is not qualified or mentally or morally fit to be the president of the United States and tonight was one more proof of it,\u201d Wilson sputtered. Lemon flooded the zone with anti-Trump pundits.\u000a\u000aThis is a good time to recall that Lemon actually wondered whether a black hole had swallowed the missing Malaysian jetliner. And then he was pulled from a New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast for drinking too much and getting his ear pierced. So, he\u2019s hardly the poster child for mental stability.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t just CNN. MSNBC\u2019s Donny Deutsch climbed on his soapbox to explain in detail why he thinks Trump is a \u201csociopath.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd it\u2019s interesting so many of the traits of a sociopath that this man is displaying,\u201d Deutsch concluded. Even Trump hater Joe Scarborough rejected Deutsch\u2019s \u201cpop psychiatry\u201d in a later appearance.\u000a\u000aUSA Today led its front page Thursday with nearly 1,900 words under the headline: \u201cTalk of Trump\u2019s Mental Health Spreads.\u201d The online version insisted that the \u201cdebate over Trump\u2019s mental health takes off.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s more. Enough that it\u2019s easy to think journalists coordinate far more than just deploy groupthink. And that\u2019s a good place to move to the rest of this week\u2019s worst:\u000a\u000a2) Forget Trump, ESPN Goes Insane: The South isn\u2019t rising again any time soon, but pretend sports network ESPN sure seems to think so. The network removed an announcer from covering a game at the University of Virginia simply because he had the same name as Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aThe Asian-American Robert Lee was shoved aside because ESPN no longer responds to lefty agitators. It anticipates their every concern. ESPN and its President John Skipper released a series of contradictory statements.\u000a\u000aOn one hand: \u201cThere was never any concern \u2013 by anyone, at any level \u2013 that Robert Lee\u2019s name would offend anyone watching the Charlottesville game.\u201d On the other, Skipper and ESPN were concerned that Lee\u2019s role (the non-General Lee) would \u201cexpose him to social hectoring and trolling.\u201d\u000a\u000aSkipper cut his teeth at Rolling Stone for eight years and then moved to its similar competitor, Spin magazine. He brought that left-wing mindset to sports. Now, it\u2019s all Colin Kaepernick all the time. Even The Washington Post called Skipper \u201ca gangly, Southern hippie.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd that hippie\u2019s network screwed up big time recently, offending the very alt-lefties Skipper loves. ESPN ran a fantasy football auction draft. Liberals compared it to a \u201cslave auction\u201d and ESPN apologized. It\u2019s obvious Skipper didn\u2019t want to rumble with social justice warriors twice in a short period of time.\u000a\u000aFor all that, I love a few of the remaining announcers at the Extra Stupid Progressive Network, but it\u2019s painful to watch a once-great network collapse into lunacy and incompetence. ESPN network president has become a Mendoza Line job and Skipper is striking out too often to reach it.\u000a\u000a3) The Blame Game: The Media vs. Trump Part II: Trump\u2019s scorching speech in Phoenix made journalists more than just hot under the collar.\u000a\u000aIt was \u201cincitement\u201d to violence, according to ABC. \u201cIt really feels like a matter of time frankly before someone gets hurt,\u201d ABC Senior White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega worried.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to tell which journalist had the worst reaction. Axios CEO and co-founder Jim VandeHei did his best to be competitive. \u201cTo family/friends who support Trump: what he said last night about reporters was despicable, extremely deceptive, dangerous\u2026,\u201d he tweeted as the first part of a five-tweet rant. He ended linking Trump to the prospect of violence against journalists: \u201cGod forbid one buys Trump's mad rant and takes action\u2026 .\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a warning that if anyone attacks a journalist anywhere in America, expect the news media to blame President Trump.\u000a\u000aWhat remains amazing is that so few journalists bother to listen to Trump\u2019s critiques and learn from them. If they did, they might learn something about why conservatives feel targeted by the press, instead of screaming that the sky is falling.\u000a\u000a4. Imagine If AMC Did This To Muslims: Entertainment media are careful about how they depict Muslims, especially the Prophet Muhammad. It\u2019s exactly the opposite when it comes to Christianity and Jesus, who Christians consider the son of God. It\u2019s not just a War on Christmas. It\u2019s a War on Christians.\u000a\u000aThe latest proof comes from this week\u2019s episode of \u201cPreacher,\u201d a deliberately shocking, anti-Christian TV show that thankfully few people watch. The episode included Jesus having a one-night stand. Then he met with the apostles and lied about it.\u000a\u000aThe pathetic script was like a Dan Brown fever dream, with the star meeting the descendant of Jesus and kneeling before him. However, in the edgy moment, the \u201cmessiah\u201d is actually a gibbering idiot who urinates on the preacher. Witty, eh?\u000a\u000aNow picture they had treated Muhammad with the same disdain. Remember the deadly, global riots over editorial cartoons depicting the prophet? Imagine if he were portrayed as an idiot who urinates on people.\u000a\u000aNow come back to the real world. Hollywood will never mistreat Islam the same way it does Christianity.\u000a\u000aHurray for Hollywood: Lots of other fun stuff out of Tinseltown this week. Actor Alec Baldwin is back portraying President Trump again and revealed in an interview that he has \u201cconsidered\u201d also running for office. He\u2019s not alone.\u000a\u000a\u201cDivergent\u201d star and lefty actress Shailene Woodley hinted at possible political future. She told the New York Times that she might \u201crun for Congress in a couple of years."\u000a\u000aHopefully, someone will get Baldwin and Woodley each a copy of \u201cThe Road to Serfdom\u201d before they enter politics. (Only $14.72 paperback on Amazon.)\u000a\u000aShowtime\u2019s resurrection of Andrew Dice Clay\u2019s career included a homage to \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d called \u201cIt\u2019s a Miserable Life.\u201d The alternate Dice Clay\u2019s life included a President Hillary Clinton who \u201cmay have just brought on world peace.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that Hillary also didn\u2019t faceplant in front of the 9/11 Memorial on Sept. 11, either.\u000a\u000aAnd let\u2019s not forget celebrity feminist Joss Whedon. The \u201cBuffy\u201d and \u201cAvengers\u201d director has made his left-wing politics very public, especially his support of feminism. Time told readers, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a high-profile, ardently feminist man to direct a movie about a female superhero, you can\u2019t do much better than Whedon.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to his estranged wife, Whedon isn\u2019t so feminist. She wrote a long and detailed attack and accused him of many wrongs including \u201cmultiple affairs.\u201d\u000a\u000aHypocritical liberals are the real monsters of Hollywood. Not the vampires of \u201cBuffy.\u201d\u000a\u000aFun Factoids: This has been an awful week, no matter what side of politics you land on. So here\u2019s an entertaining peak behind the curtain of journalism.\u000a\u000aThe Society of Professional Journalists (to which I happily belong) ran a recent cover story called \u201cTraining Day\u201d in its magazine The Quill. It depicted a woman running up stairs \u2013 you know, training.\u000a\u000aThat caused a triggering. One journalist wrote a letter to the board, complaining. \u201cWhat does a woman\u2019s butt have to do with a journalism conference? The answer is, of course, nothing, but that\u2019s not what thousands of SPJ member were led to believe when they looked at the July/August issue of Quill,\u201d she said, as part of a lengthy criticism. It had a telling phrase: \u201cI have a feeling that some of you think I am blowing this out of proportion.\u201d Yep.\u000a\u000aThe board responded and the writer was still not satisfied. Then the Rio Grande Chapter chimed in, also upset.\u000a\u000aWomen journalists do some amazing work. I\u2019ve been lucky to know some of the finest. Not one of them would have written this. And I bet most or all would have laughed at it. To paraphrase author George Orwell, all journalists are equal but some journalists are more equal than others.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s this victim culture that drives journalism in 2017. If we can\u2019t laugh at it, all we can do is cry.\u000a\u000aDan Gainor is the Media Research Center's Vice President for Business and Culture.

aVTensions between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have escalated dramatically recently, to the point that the two haven't spoken with each other in weeks, according to a New York Times report on Tuesday. The once-private feud between the two Republicans has spilled out into the open in the wake of several controversial moves by Trump this summer that may threaten the GOP agenda when Congress heads back to Washington in September. The Times cites Trump's public criticism of McConnell this month after Republicans' last-ditch effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in July as a critical moment in the deterioration of their relationship. In a series of tweets, Trump pinned the blame on McConnell. Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union, joined the Todd Starnes Show today to discuss President Trump's relationship with the mainstream media, with other republicans, and with Mitch McConnell. On President Trump not receiving support from many republican politicians, Schlapp said, "At some point republican leaders lost support of their grassroots supporters. That can't go on very long before you have catastrophic fail." Schlapp also said that republicans like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan "never warmed to the idea of a President Trump. They didn't think he'd get the nomination. They didn't think he'd win." Listen to the full interview below:

aVFOX NEWS - Jerry Lewis, the rubber-faced, squeaky-voiced comedy legend who starred in movies and musicals and also was known for his unflagging work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, died on Sunday, his publicist confirmed. He was 91 years old.\u000a\u000aLewis' publicist confirmed the news to The Associated Press. The Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist John Katsilometes first reported Lewis' death.\u000a\u000aLewis "passed peacefully at home this morning of natural causes at the age of 91 with his loving family by his side," manager Mark Rozzano said.\u000a\u000aLewis had gone through a series of health problems and scares in recent years. In June 2012 he was hospitalized for two nights in New York after collapsing with what was reported to be a low blood sugar problem.\u000a\u000aHe was forced to cancel a fund-raising show in Australia due to poor health in June 2011.\u000a\u000aLewis had been touring Australia to raise money for the country's Muscular Dystrophy Foundation, which is separate from the American association, where he served as president.\u000a\u000aHe announced in 2011 he was retiring as host of the association's Labor Day Telethon, which he began hosting in 1966.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, Lewis also suffered from a back condition linked to a comedic pratfall from a piano, as well as heart problems. He reportedly had at least two heart attacks.\u000a\u000aThe comedian who first gained fame as part of a duo with singer Dean Martin was born Joseph Levitch on March 16, 1926 in Newark, New Jersey.\u000a\u000aHis parents were entertainers and young Jerry made his debut at age five on New York's Catskill Mountains entertainment circuit.\u000a\u000aHe began using the professional name Joey Lewis, but later changed it to Jerry, reportedly to avoid confusion with comedian Joe E. Lewis.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1946, Lewis teamed up with Martin \u2013 first with a nightclub act, then radio and television appearances. Martin was the suave, debonair singer while Lewis was the zany, boyish sidekick with the huge grin and squeaky voice.\u000a\u000aThey went on to make a series of movies together before the partnership ended in 1956 and both launched successful solo careers.\u000a\u000aLewis became a major comedy star with his first solo film, 1957's "The Delicate Delinquent," followed by "Rock-A-Bye Baby" and "The Geisha Boy." His later films included "The Bellboy," "Cinderfella," "The Nutty Professor" and "The King of Comedy."\u000a\u000aHe also appeared in stage musicals and in 1994 made his Broadway debut as the Devil in a revival of "Damn Yankees."\u000a\u000aLewis was consistently respected abroad and a perennial favorite of French critics, sometimes to the amusement of fans at home. In 2006 the French Minister of Culture awarded him the Legion d'Honneur, saying he was the 'French people's favorite clown."

President Obama called us bitter. Hillary Clinton called us irredeemable. The mainstream media called us backwater bigots. We were mocked by Hollywood and dismissed by academics.

Bob Menendez (D-NJ), only the 12th sitting senator in U.S. history to face indictment. If he\u2019s found guilty and forced to leave office before the end of the year that likely would hand Republicans his Senate seat until the 2018 elections, giving them a crucial extra vote as they try to salvage what they can of their and President Trump\u2019s agenda and possibly resurrect their efforts to repeal Obamacare.

aVBy Pamela K. Browne, Cyd Upson, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aThe former British spy who put together an unverified dossier of explosive allegations about President Trump during last year\u2019s campaign has been ordered to give a deposition in a multi-million-dollar libel case brought against a media outlet that published the document.\u000a\u000aFormer MI-6 British Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele is fighting the decision by U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro, of the Southern District of Florida that he must answer questions in the suit against Buzzfeed. A lawyer directly involved in the case said the issue will likely be argued before the British courts where a similar libel case is being heard.\u000a\u000aSteele's London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence, authored the 35-page dossier while working for American-based Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson. The document, which was crafted as opposition research for unknown political rivals of Trump, contained salacious charges involving Trump and Russian prostitutes, but none of the claims have been corroborated and most media outlets steered clear of the dossier.

aVTiger Woods, Lindsey Vonn, Katharine McPhee and Kristen Stewart are among the latest celebrity victims of a private photo leak.\u000a\u000aThey are far from the first stars to have their racy pictures hacked. Everyone from Jennifer Lawrence to Scarlett Johansson to Emma Watson has had private photos stolen and published for the world to see: So why do A-listers continue to take nude pics knowing they could be leaked?\u000a\u000aClinical psychologist Dr. Chloe Carmichael speculated that stars play with fire due to \u201can unconscious conflict between a wish for privacy and a love of the spotlight.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarmichael suggested some stars may want the attention of having their photos leak online.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible that there is a part of the celebrity that enjoys the attention, and taking legal action actually intensifies the spotlight upon the event,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aBut Kevin Blatt, celebrity crisis expert with the VIP cyber security company Faction.One, said there's more to it than fame.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe a lot of these celebs are complete narcissists. They love to see themselves naked or in a sexy, compromising position. They love to show themselves off," said Blatt.\u000a\u000aWhile Scott Pinsker, publicity and branding expert, speculated that many stars may just think hacks can't happen to them.\u000a\u000a"Celebrities have made careers out of defying the odds. They've achieved enormous success in highly-competitive industries... They don't think they'll get hacked because they've proven the naysayers wrong every step of the way," Pinsker speculated. "The rules don't ever seem to apply to them."\u000a\u000aStill, if stars must take compromising pics, co-founder of the cyber security firm RISKGEN Chris Jones said there are smarter ways to go about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf something can be seen it can be copied and that's the biggest risk of transmitting a sensitive image," he explained. "If you do need to send an intimate picture, I would use an ephemeral app like Snapchat, where you can control how long the image remains in the system before it is purged."\u000a\u000aFox News.com Reporter and FOX411 host Diana Falzone covers celebrity news and interviews some of today's top celebrities and newsmakers.

aVFrom the bestselling team of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard comes Killing Reagan, a page-turning epic account of the career of President Ronald Reagan that tells the vivid story of his rise to power -- and the forces of evil that conspired to bring him down.\u000a\u000aJust two months into his presidency, Ronald Reagan lay near death after a gunman's bullet came within inches of his heart. His recovery was nothing short of remarkable -- or so it seemed. But Reagan was grievously injured, forcing him to encounter a challenge that few men ever face. Could he silently overcome his traumatic experience while at the same time carrying out the duties of the most powerful man in the world?\u000a\u000aTold in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton, Killing Reagan reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in the California governor's mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan's most heroic actions. In Killing Reagan, O'Reilly and Dugard take readers behind the scenes, creating an unforgettable portrait of a great man operating in violent times.
