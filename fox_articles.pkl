VBy Christian Toto, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf\u2019s Trump hate save his career? The Transformers star is in big trouble. Again. Could his ardent hate for President Trump help him bounce back?\u000a\u000aMel Gibson couldn\u2019t get arrested in Hollywood following his oh, so famous public meltdown in 2006.\u000a\u000aThe Lethal Weapon star ranted against the Jews while being cuffed on DUI charges. It took years for Gibson to get in the industry\u2019s good graces again. He apologized repeatedly, kept a low profile and performed in some indie films before winning raves for his 2016 war film Hacksaw Ridge.\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf follow in Gibson\u2019s tainted footsteps? Or will the actor\u2019s anti-Trump performance art buffer him against a similar career catastrophe?

(Here is a link to an interview I did with the band: https://vimeo.com/225709341)\u000a\u000aFeminist critics attack the movie "Dunkirk," an historical reenactment of the World War 2 evacuation, because well\u2014It was the first time there were no women on a French beach.\u000a\u000aOutcry erupts when a Broadway play tries to substitute theater legend Mandy Patinkin for a black actor in a play, to help save the play from closing due to declining ticket sales. Unable to hide the fact that he is white, Patinkin and the producers back down like good fearful liberals; the play - which features a diversity of talent - is now in jeopardy as ticket sales continue to drop.\u000a\u000aLeftwing madwoman Lena Dunham hears voices -- specifically, a conversation between flight attendants over their opinion on trans issues - and instead of confronting them, she narcs on them to their bosses. Like a paranoid member of some sort of regressive left secret police, she seeks to punish strangers over an unacceptable conversation she claims to have heard in her head.\u000a\u000aThe airline, however, can find no evidence that the conversation actually happened in real life, and are disputing the account. An investigation, which pokes a constellation of holes in Dunham's story, suggests she might have fabricated, or at the very least exaggerated the incident - much like her recent excuses for abandoning her dog at a pound, and assorted lurid tales she alleged in her desperate, attention-craving memoir. In each case, she wasted the time of responsible, employed men and women - time that could have been better used to deal with actual concerns, instead of indulging a fantasist.

But they, too, headed to the fantasy suite.\u000a\u000aThe bachelorette and Bryan were shown cuddling in bed the morning after.\u000a\u000aAt the rose ceremony, she sent Eric, the final African American competitor, home.\u000a\u000aEric was devastated as she told him that she had stronger feelings for Bryan and Peter.\u000a\u000aGoing back to the live studio, Eric joined Rachel and looked different with a full beard.\u000a\u000a"You gotta do what you gotta do," good sport Eric told Rachel about failing to win her heart.

aVIn a fiery polemic on our personal finances, Gerri Willis, anchor and personal finance correspondent for Fox Business News, reveals how liberal policy has decimated our wallets.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Rich Is Not a Four-Letter Word, veteran financial journalist and pundit Gerri Willis takes on the progressive mind-set championed by liberals that gives government bureaucrats the right to decide what's best for us, resulting in bigger government programs, more bureaucracy, and more wasted taxpayer money. She dissects Obamacare and Democratic tax initiatives to show how they have hamstrung the average American. Then she shows us how to overcome these left wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the topics she tackles in the book: (1) How the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom (a new Blackrock survey shows that 4 out of 10 Americans haven't even started saving for retirement)--and how to get it back; (2) How the wide-open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year--and how we can successfully navigate the system; (3)How, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored health-care coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies have begun to abandon employee health-care coverage and opt to pay a less expensive federal penalty; (4) Why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.

aVIran signed the country's biggest-ever car deal on Monday to build tens of thousands of cars annually under a joint venture with French automobile manufacturer Groupe Renault, buoying its manufacturing industry in defiance of the Trump administration's moves to isolate the country.\u000a\u000aThe \u20ac660 million \u2014 or $778 million \u2014 deal follows the lifting of the U.N. and European Union sanctions after Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers to curb its controversial uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aIt also comes just days after new U.S. sanctions on Iran were signed by President Donald Trump, who spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend about ways to counter Iran's influence in Mideast conflicts. The U.S. legislation, first passed by Congress, imposes penalties on people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.\u000a\u000aAmerican businesses have been cautious about pursuing business deals with Iran due to U.S. sanctions in place not related to the nuclear program.\u000a\u000aAsian and European companies, meanwhile, have raced for a share of Iran's sizable consumer market since international sanctions were lifted. Iran, with its population of 80 million people, sits atop the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-biggest reserves of natural gas. It also has well-established manufacturing and agricultural industries.\u000a\u000aJust last month, France Total SA and state-run China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop the country's massive offshore natural gas field in the first such deal since the landmark nuclear deal was struck. Also, Washington granted permission to Chicago-based Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars' worth of aircraft to Iran in September 2016.\u000a\u000aRenault and other European companies are looking to rebuild their presence in Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Renault says that in the first half of 2017, its sales in Iran increased by more than 100 percent to 68,365 vehicles \u2014 a nearly 10 percent market share.\u000a\u000aThe new deal, first reached with Iran's government last September, will see Renault produce 150,000 vehicles a year in Iran at a plant located 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside Tehran. The plant will produce Duster and Symbol cars starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aRenault, a majority shareholder with a 60 percent share in the deal, will have its own distribution network in Iran for the first time. The company has been operating in Iran since 2003, though operations were halted when Iran came under international sanctions over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aDuring the signing ceremony in Tehran, Iran's Minister of Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said the deal with Renault would "establish a research and development center for designing" in the country.\u000a\u000aA Renault executive, Thierry Bolloré, said it would help transfer technology to Iran and reinforce Groupe Renault's position there.\u000a\u000a"This joint venture will enable an acceleration of our growth in this country," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe car deal is expected to create about 3,000 jobs for the two Iranian companies involved: IDRO, or the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and the privately-owned Negin Group, which imports Renault products to Iran.\u000a\u000aAlso last year, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen reached a deal to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually in Iran. Peugeot was a major player in Iran's car market before international sanctions were imposed.\u000a\u000aIran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year, though authorities hope that number will reach 3 million annually by 2025. There are around 30 car manufacturers in Iran, most of which assemble Chinese and Korean cars in Iran.

But his treatment involved a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a natural resistance to HIV, which is risky and impractical due to the large number of patients already infected.\u000a\u000aWhat's hopeful about the girl's case, is that she is the third child to enter long remission after beginning aggressive treatment soon after infection. She started when she was two and stopped 40 weeks later. Tests found the virus was not capable of reproducing in her immune system cells.\u000a\u000aFor more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.\u000a\u000aHousecall for Health, I'm Alex Hein, FOX News.

aVAttorney General Jeff Sessions fired back Monday at the lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago over the Justice Department\u2019s threat to withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities, saying \u201cno amount\u201d of money will help a city that won\u2019t help its own residents.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis administration is committed to the rule of law and to enforcing the laws established by Congress. To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country\u2019s lawful immigration system,\u201d Sessions said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe city filed its suit over the Justice Department's threat to withhold Byrne grants for law enforcement groups from sanctuary cities. The city\u2019s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, likened this to \u201cblackmail.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming city,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cThe federal government should be working with cities to provide necessary resources to improve public safety, not concocting new schemes to reduce our crime-fighting resources.\u201d\u000a\u000aSessions said the city of Chicago has chosen to protect \u201ccriminal aliens who prey on their own residents\u201d instead of enforcing laws meant to protect law enforcement.\u000a\u000aThe attorney general called the \u201copen hostility\u201d against protecting law enforcement -- while protecting criminal aliens -- \u201castounding\u201d given the influx of Chicago\u2019s violence crime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe city\u2019s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve,\u201d Sessions continued.\u000a\u000aThe grants, named for former New York City police officer Edward Byrne, who was murdered in 1988, would provide $3.2 million to Chicago, to be used for police vehicles. Funding from the grant is a small fraction of the city's budget.\u000a\u000aA requirement added to the grants would force local jurisdictions to report to federal officials of the release of illegal immigrants from police custody at least 48 hours in advance, which Emanuel said would violate citizens\u2019 \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d\u000a\u000aCRIME-RIDDEN CHICAGO SUES DOJ OVER SANCTUARY CITIES\u000a\u000aEmanuel \u201ccomplains that the federal government\u2019s focus on enforcing the law would require a \u2018reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago,\u2019\u201d Sessions said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that rollback the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cChicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated. And Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\u000a\u000aDOJ THREATENS TO WITHHOLD CRIME-FIGHTS FUNDS FROM FOUR SANCTUARY CITIES\u000a\u000aEmanual said he did not think Chicago would be the last sanctuary city to file a lawsuit of this nature. Other cities the DOJ contacted about withholding funds of this nature include Baltimore, Albuquerque, N.M., and Stockton and San Bernardino, Calif.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,\u201d Sessions concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s this simple: Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars.\u201d

He's been wanted on an international arrest warrant issued by Germany shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aGermany-born Bahaji, who is of Moroccan descent, is believed to have helped suicide hijackers Mohamad Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah when they were in Hamburg, and to have fled shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks.\u000a\u000aIn an operation in 2009, the Pakistani military battled their way into a Taliban stronghold along the Afghan border and found Bahaji's German passport, among others. It included a tourist visa for Pakistan and a stamp indicating he had arrived in the southern city of Karachi on Sept. 4, 2001.\u000a\u000aThe authenticity of the al-Zawahri recording could not be independently confirmed but it resembled previous messages released by the al Qaeda leader.\u000a\u000aSITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that monitors militant messaging, reported on the recording, noting that in it, al-Zawahri also "revealed that Khalid Sheikh Muhammad," a top al Qaida leader in U.S. custody, founded As-Sahab.\u000a\u000aGermany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, would not comment on Tuesday on the recording, citing organizational policy.\u000a\u000aBahaji was long suspected of having died, but al Qaeda never publicly acknowledged his death until al-Zawahri's audio recording a week ago.\u000a\u000aIn a list published by the United Nations Security Council of people and entities against whom there are sanctions, Bahaji is said to be "reportedly deceased in September 2013 in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border area."

aVNorth Korea, showing no intention of succumbing to international sanctions designed to end to the rogue regime's missile tests, once again on Tuesday hurled threats, vowing to send "packs of wolves" to "strangle" the nations standing firm in opposing Kim Jong Un's dictatorship.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe country's official KCNA news agency issued the threat one day after declaring North Korea would strike the U.S. with "thousands-fold" revenge in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Friday.\u000a\u000a"Packs of wolves are coming in attack to strangle a nation," the statement said. "They should be mindful that [North Korea's] strategic steps accompanied by physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength."\u000a\u000aHALEY: NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO BRACE FOR COMBINED PRESSURE FROM US AND THE WORLD\u000a\u000aThe "physical action" the rogue nation alludes to is likely the testing of more intercontinental ballistic missiles, part of the "unexpected gift packages" it consistently promises to send to the U.S. North Korea's news agency previously described the sanctions as "crimes" that were a "violent violation of our sovereignty" and a "heinous plot to isolate and stifle" the communist country.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to introduce the set of punishing sanctions -- the harshest since the dictatorship's first nuclear experiment in 2006. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said America had the iron-clad upper hand in pressuring North Korea with the new sanctions.\u000a\u000a"It was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back," Haley told Fox News' "The Story," adding that "we are not going to run scared from them."\u000a\u000aNORTH KOREA THREATENS US WITH MORE 'UNEXPECTEDGIFT PACKAGES' AFTER MISSILE TEST\u000a\u000aBut China still remains a roadblock in deterring North Korea. China is Pyongyang's biggest trading partner and has supported the dictatorship since it came into power. Haley, however, said she remains hopeful China will follow through with its obligations.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"China stepped up and said, we will follow through on these sanctions. And they encouraged the international community to follow it. When that missile test took off, they felt it in China. And they\u2019re disturbed enough to say that they now have to do their part," Haley said.\u000a\u000aWILL TOUGHER SANCTIONS HAVE ANY EFFECT ON NORTHKOREA?\u000a\u000aNorth Korea successfully tested two ICBM's in recent weeks, after a series of other missile launches carried out this year. Pyongyang has shown no signs of slowing down or halting the tests. At least half of the U.S. mainland is already believed to be in range of North Korean missiles.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1942, in the dead of night, eight Nazi saboteurs landed by submarine on the eastern shores of the United States.\u000a\u000aSent by Hitler himself, the invaders planned to blow up industrial targets and spread fear and panic throughout the country. The Nazi dictator intended to strike a second blow to an America still reeling from the attacks at Pearl Harbor just six months earlier. But the U.S. Coast Guard and the FBI uncovered the plot and tracked down the enemy agents. These saboteurs met their fate in a secret military trial that is still controversial to this day.\u000a\u000aThis group of saboteurs was not the first Nazi agents discovered on American soil. In New York in 1941, 44 men and women were arrested as part of a spy ring that sent American military secrets back to Germany. What is shocking about these two episodes of sabotage is that all the men and women working for Hitler lived here in America. They spoke English, worked in American factories and businesses, many were American citizens. Yet they believed in Nazi Germany and many were involved in a sinister pro-Hitler organization based right here in America called the German American Bund. They seemed like Americans, but they came to kill.\u000a\u000aIn this episode of "War Stories With Oliver North," you'll hear the fascinating tales of enemy agents infiltrating the United States. You'll meet the U.S. Coast Guardsman and FBI agents who worked together to stop these acts of sabotage.\u000a\u000aThis is the story of the men who invaded our country and those who stopped them.

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

He shouldn\u2019t be negotiating Middle East peace.\u201d All three podcasters enjoyed referring to anyone near Trump as incompetent and liars.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison.

aVPhiladelphia's tax on sugary drinks has made soda more expensive than beer in the city.\u000a\u000aThe Tax Foundation released a new study on the excise tax last week, finding that the 1.5-cent per ounce tax has fallen short of revenue projections, cost jobs, and has forced some Philadelphians to drive outside the city to buy groceries.\u000a\u000aThe study finds that the tax is 24 times higher than the Pennsylvania tax rate on beer.\u000a\u000a"Purchases of beer are also now less expensive than nonalcoholic beverages subject to the tax in the city," according to the study, written by Courtney Shupert and Scott Drenkard. "Empirical evidence from a 2012 journal article suggests that soda taxes can push consumers to alcohol, meaning it is likely the case that consumers are switching to alcoholic beverages as a result of the tax. The paper, aptly titled From Coke to Coors, further shows that switching from soda to beer increases total caloric intake, even as soda taxes are generally aimed at caloric reduction."\u000a\u000aThe Tax Foundation points out that unlike most cities, Philadelphia passed the tax specifically to raise revenue, not to fight obesity. The city even includes diet sodas in its tax, as a way to raise money for pre-kindergarten programs.\u000a\u000aHowever, less than half of the $39.4 million collected since the tax went into effect on Jan. 1 has gone to education funding.\u000a\u000aClick for more from The Washington Free Beacon.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVSex sells, but is there a limit to how much titillation consumers want?\u000a\u000aChocotravel is a ticketing service based in Kazakhstan that is apparently looking to make a splash with their new app. To their credit, they picked pretty much the most straight-forward way to advertize \u2014 with plenty of skin.\u000a\u000aHowever, the ads have left both the travel industry and consumers shaking their heads.\u000a\u000aThe barely-there wardrobes in the ad were apparently supposed to have a purpose: to highlight the nothing-added fee structure of the company. Yet, the message that was actually communicated was more along the lines of "buy our product because of these attractive ladies."\u000a\u000aIf you're thinking that Chocotravel was just catering to one gender, you would be mistaken, because the company responded to claims of sexism by digging their proverbial hole even further and releasing a second video featuring some men showing \u2014 as they say \u2014 the "Full Monty."\u000a\u000aHere's a pro tip for any companies that might be foolish enough to copy this advertising strategy: If you're looking to get past a charge of sexism, making sure all of your pilots are males and all of your attendants are female isn't the way to do it.\u000a\u000aThe backlash to the company has been fierce thanks to internet comments, and plenty of digital ink has already been spilled on the matter. The company's director isn't convinced the criticisms are correct, however, and has responded via his personal Facebook page, as reported by the BBC.\u000a\u000a"On his Facebook page, Chocotravel Ticketing Service director, Nikolay Mazensev, has responded to the criticism saying the clips were "bold and outrageous and we did not mean to offend."\u000a\u000aHe adds: "It shows no less than you'd see on the beach or by the pool. Do you attack girls in short skirts or swimsuits?"\u000a\u000aWhether or not Chocotravel benefits from the ads or decides to change strategy in future campaigns remains to be seen. What is clear is that they've made a splash in the market place \u2014 though slightly bigger and messier than they likely intended.

aVBy Dr. Keith Ablow | Fox News\u000a\u000aNew Planned Parenthood guidelines for parents now advise that children as young as four years old be informed that having a penis or a vagina doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are male or female. Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches. Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.

aVThese days, the price of a San Francisco home can easily top a million dollars. But one savvy investor has bought up a whole street in the city's most exclusive neighborhood for a mere $90,000.\u000a\u000aTrouble is, some of the extremely wealthy residents of Presidio Terrace were not aware their street was up for sale and are not pleased it has been sold.\u000a\u000aPresidio Terrace is an oval shaped street sealed off by a gate from the tony Presidio Heights neighborhood. Lined with towering palm trees and multimillion dollar mansions, the street has been home, over the years, to famous residents including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThanks to a city auction stemming from an unpaid tax bill, Bay Area real estate investor Michael Cheng, and his wife Tina Lam, bought the street and now own the sidewalks, the street itself and other areas of "common ground" in the private development that, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, has been managed by the homeowners association since at least 1905.\u000a\u000aCheng says reaction to the sale has been less than neighborly.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"I thought they would reach out to us and invite us in as new neighbors," Cheng told The Associated Press. "This has certainly blown up a lot more than we expected."\u000a\u000aIt turns out the homeowners association for Presidio Terrace failed to pay a $14-a-year property tax, something that owners of all 181 private streets in San Francisco must do, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aSo the city's tax office put the property up for sale at the cost of $994 in an online auction to regain unpaid back taxes, penalties and interest. The couple eventually won the street with a $90,100 bid in an April 2015 auction.\u000a\u000aScott Emblidge, the attorney for the Presidio Homeowners Association, said in a letter to the city that the owners failed to pay because the tax bill was mistakenly being sent to the address of an accountant who hadn't worked for the homeowners association since the 1980s, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aEmblidge said the residents didn't know their street was put on the auction block, let alone sold, until May when a title search company hired by Cheng and Lam reached out to ask if any residents had interest in buying back the property.\u000a\u000aThat was one of several options Cheng and Lam have considered for making the investment pay off.\u000a\u000aAnother option is to charge residents to park on their street \u2014 and rent out the 120 parking spaces that line the grand circular road.\u000a\u000a"As legal owners of this property, we have a lot of options," Cheng said, adding that nothing has been decided.\u000a\u000aThe matter could be headed for court.\u000a\u000aLast month, the homeowners petitioned the Board of Supervisors for a hearing to rescind the tax sale. The board has scheduled a hearing for October. The homeowners association has also sued the couple and the city, seeking to block Cheng and Lam from selling the street to anyone while the city appeal is pending.

aVThe complex choreography of Saturn's numerous moons displays beautiful physics, but only a few of the worlds may be friendly to life.\u000a\u000aOceans of liquid water, deep beneath the icy crusts of three of Saturn's natural satellites, may satisfy the conditions needed for "life as we know it," scientists say. The small, bright-white Enceladus and Dione, and the giant, orange, haze-enshrouded Titan each probably contain such subsurface seas. But the unique structure and contents of each ocean represent a different possible solution to the life equation.\u000a\u000aThe Cassini-Huygens mission \u2014 a collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency \u2014 has been a prolific pioneer of Saturn's moons. When the mission launched in 1997, 18 moons were known to orbit the planet, and 13 more were suspected. But the number of confirmed moons now stands at 53, with another nine marked as "conditional." Cassini's data revealed seven entirely unknown moons that are not observable from Earth. [The Rings and Moons of Saturn in Pictures]\u000a\u000aThis elaborate system of moons forms a complex clockwork of gravitational resonances; they perturb one another's orbits and constantly sculpt Saturn's rings. And the massive planet gravitationally disrupts the moons, warming some of them to the point of possibly swaddling life beneath their surfaces.\u000a\u000aThe first hints that something wonderful might be going on beneath the surface of the small moon Enceladus came during the 1981 flyby mission of NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. Enceladus appeared remarkably bright and unusually smooth, with comparatively few craters. This 314-mile-wide (505 kilometers) moon turned out to be the whitest object in the solar system.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, Cassini's magnetometer readings of Enceladus raised researchers' eyebrows: The moon's magnetic signature looked more like that of a comet than that of a typical spherical satellite. The field lines seemed to bend around Enceladus' southern pole. On a pass where Enceladus was seen against the black background of space, Cassini's cameras caught plumes of water emanating from that polar region.\u000a\u000aSeveral Cassini flybys confirmed that the area was about 180 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) warmer than the rest of the moon's surface. The heat source was aligned with four prominent "tiger stripe" features. These turned out to be fissures \u2014 cracks in the icy crust through which geysers shoot water into space at about 800 mph (about 1,300 km/h).\u000a\u000aCassini sailed within 31 miles (50 km) of Enceladus' south pole on March 12, 2008. During that flyby, the probe sampled the plumes, and found that they were made of water laced with ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide. More flybys were planned. By April 2014, it was clear that some of the geyser particles were salty, flavored with potassium and sodium, very similar to Earthly sea spray. Hydrogen gas was detected in the jets, as were silicate crystals, which could only have been formed in boiling water, scientists said. [Photos: Enceladus, Saturn's Cold, Bright Moon]\u000a\u000aThis evidence, taken together, suggests the presence of a salty ocean of liquid water under the ice, in contact with a hot, rocky seafloor through which mineral-laden hot water flows. It is easy to imagine hydrothermal vents there, very similar to the "black smokers" and "white smokers" found on the bottom of Earth's oceans, where they form oases for communities of life.\u000a\u000aEnceladus seems to be begging us to return with instruments capable of detecting amino acids, fatty acids and long-chain carbon molecules \u2014 and perhaps even imaging equipment to photograph any possible microorganisms themselves.\u000a\u000aTitan, which is 10 times wider than Enceladus, is also a world of liquids. But the fluids flowing on Titan's surface are hydrocarbons, not water. At Titan's surface temperature, water is rock-hard. But methane, ethane and propane slosh around in all three states: solid, liquid and gaseous. The surface of this moon is nearly impossible to see from space at visual wavelengths; thick, orange smog pervades the place. This hazy atmosphere is rich with organic compounds.\u000a\u000aFortunately, Cassini can see in infrared and radar wavelengths. And the Cassini orbiter carried a lander called Huygens, which touched down on Titan's surface in January 2005. Huygens carried cameras down through the atmosphere. And, upon soft-landing on the shore of a hydrocarbon lake, it sent close-ups of rounded pebbles, which were probably made of water. The landforms on Titan are eerily familiar; they look a lot like coastlines and river lands on Earth.\u000a\u000aTitan, too, must be warm inside. This moon changes shape as it orbits Saturn once every 16 days. Cassini measured Titan's tidal bulging, finding the surface rising and falling on the order of 30 feet (9 meters). If Titan were completely solid, those tides would be at least 10 times less pronounced, scientists have said.\u000a\u000aBut the floor of Titan's subsurface ocean may be compacted and frozen, not warm, scientists have said. This could prevent warm liquid water from receiving the complex mix of minerals necessary for life to arise, at least from below. Therefore, it's critical to know if the organic-rich surface of Titan can "communicate" with the subsurface seas.\u000a\u000aOne great mystery about Titan is how so much methane can be present at its surface. Methane breaks down quickly, so something must be replenishing it. If there are deep cracks, or cryovolcanic vents, through which ammonia from a salty underground ocean may rise, sunlight would break down the molecules, thus liberating lots of methane. That same pathway could let surface material and atmospheric organic material seep or slide down to the waters beneath. In that case, life may be possible within Titan's interior ocean, even if its floor is frozen. [Amazing Photos: Titan, Saturn's Largest Moon]\u000a\u000aLike Enceladus and Titan, the Saturnian moons Dione and Tethys are subject to the warping and twisting effects of Saturn's tidal gravity. And both of these worlds show bright, relatively smooth and roughly circular surface patches where ponds of liquid water appear to have frozen across craters. They would make nice skating rinks. These events likely happened relatively recently on geologic time scales.\u000a\u000aDione is similar to Enceladus but, at 700 miles (1,100 km) in diameter, is about two times larger. Dione's icy crust is much thicker than that of Enceladus, boasting a substantial 60 miles (100 km) of crystallized water. But a recent study based on Cassini's gravity measurements suggests that a tremendous quantity of liquid water sloshes beneath that shell.\u000a\u000aThe floor of Dione's subsurface ocean is probably the rocky core of the moon itself, according to the study. A future submarine probe may find many sources of heat and mineral nutrients to sustain life, if biology ever began there \u2014 or was seeded from afar. Dione's waters likely have been liquid through most of the moon's history, adding the vital element of time for biology to evolve and differentiate, researchers have said.\u000a\u000aSuch "snow-globe worlds" \u2014 bodies with cold crystal exteriors housing warm liquid oceans full of particles cascading and mixing \u2014 are not unique to Saturn.\u000a\u000aThe dwarf planet Pluto may enclose such an ocean. Pluto and its largest moon Charon, which is about half as wide as the dwarf planet itself, can be considered a binary system. Their mutual attraction may heat up their interiors, and parts of Pluto seem to have been resurfaced in the recent past, scientists have said.\u000a\u000aGiant Jupiter exerts massive tidal forces on the four large moons first noted by Galileo Galilei four centuries ago. The innermost of these moons, Io, almost seems to be turning inside out. More than 400 active sulfur volcanoes blast this moon's guts into space. Its core of molten iron singes the surface from below. Of the worlds in our solar system, Io may bear the closest resemblance to classical notions of hell. All of its water long since lost, it's the driest object in the solar system.\u000a\u000aThere are no water oceans on Io. But each of its three siblings \u2014 Europa, Ganymede and Callisto \u2014 encloses a sea beneath its surface.\u000a\u000aEuropa, which is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, holds a thin oxygen atmosphere. This world sports the smoothest surface in the solar system, with very few impact craters, implying that it's being repaved with water ice from inside, scientists have said. Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have spotted hints of water-vapor plumes emanating from Europa that may be similar to the "cryogeysers" of Enceladus.\u000a\u000aSaturn's ocean-harboring moons get most of the press, but the ringed planet's many dry satellites are fascinating in their own right. Each Saturnian moon is a unique jewel in the majestic planet's necklace.\u000a\u000aSome of these moons, like Mimas, look like the results of ancient, catastrophic collisions. Shady Phoebe, with its inky-black surface, pours matter out into space. It tints the rings and stains one hemisphere of Iapetus, the "next moon in" toward Saturn, with dark reddish shading. Sparky Hyperion is lightweight and spongy \u2014 almost like a giant piece of volcanic pumice \u2014 and electrically active. A few moons apparently are captured asteroids, visitors from deep space that strayed too close. And Cassini has spotted clumpy cocoons within the rings where tiny future moons may be growing. Together, the many moons of Saturn form an enthralling exhibit of nature's creativity.\u000a\u000aFor a deeper look into all that Cassini has found in its 13 years in the Saturn system, watch the 73-minute documentary " Kingdom of Saturn \u2014 Cassini's Epic Quest ," available at Amazon XiveTV.\u000a\u000aThe author, @DavidSkyBrody, is the writer and director of " Kingdom of Saturn \u2014 Cassini's Epic Quest ," a documentary look back at the mission, available at Amazon XiveTV.

aVEarth's orbit within the sun's habitable zone means its temperatures are just right for life. But icy worlds located within their star's habitable zone may abruptly skip from too cold to too hot without going through a habitable stage, a new study finds.\u000a\u000aThe finding suggests that there may be fewer potentially habitable worlds than scientists previously thought, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aWhereas Venus seems too hot for life and Mars seems too cold, Earth lies between Venus and Mars, where temperatures have the potential to be just right for its surface to possess liquid water. This "Goldilocks" zone is also known as the habitable zone, because on Earth, there is life virtually wherever there is liquid water.\u000a\u000aStars like the sun brighten over time. This raises the possibility that a planet or moon that starts out cold and icy around a young dim star, such as early Earth, may eventually warm to a stable habitable state as the star grows more luminous. [How Habitable Zones for Alien Planets and Stars Work (Infographic)]\u000a\u000aHowever, the new study finds that some planets may go directly from a Mars-like icehouse stage to a Venus-like hothouse phase, bypassing Earth-like habitable conditions.\u000a\u000a"Previously, studies suggested that icy planets and moons, such as [Jupiter's moon] Europa, will become habitable for life after their surface ice or snow melts," said study lead author Jun Yang, of Peking University in Beijing. "Our work shows that this will not happen."\u000a\u000aThe climate of a water-rich planet depends on at least two factors. One is how much ice covers its surface. Ice has a high albedo, meaning it reflects much of the light that falls onto it back to space before the light can warm the planet's surface. In this way, the ice cools the planet, which leads to the formation of more ice and makes the planet even colder. The second factor is the amount of water vapor in the planet's atmosphere; water vapor is a greenhouse gas that traps heat, warming a planet, which leads more water to evaporate and makes the planet even warmer.\u000a\u000aThe albedo of ice plays a dominant role in the climate of icy planets. A 2004 study suggested that Earth escaped a possible "snowball phase" because the sun brightened over time and because volcanic activity on Earth released carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that helped the planet retain heat.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, many icy bodies, such as Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, do not release large amounts of greenhouse gases via volcanoes. As such, researchers wanted to see how these worlds evolved if they had only the light of their stars to help warm them.\u000a\u000aIn the new study, the scientists developed a global climate model that simulated the evolution of the climate of an icy planet lacking greenhouse gases other than water vapor. This 3D computer model included multiple layers of the atmosphere, as well as winds and their effects on temperatures, clouds, water vapor, snow and ice, according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that, without the presence of greenhouse gases besides water vapor, icy bodies needed a lot of energy from their stars before they started melting \u2014 about 10 to 40 percent more than Earth gets from the sun. When the ice finally did melt in simulations, the resulting drop in albedo made these worlds much warmer very quickly. This rapid warming often led to greenhouse stages in which most or all of the water oceans vaporized, rendering these worlds uninhabitable for water-based life as it is known on Earth.\u000a\u000a"The finding suggests the number of potentially habitable planets and moons may be less than previously estimated, especially for small icy planets and icy moons," Yang told Space.com.\u000a\u000aThe paper detailing the new findings was published online July 31 in the journal Nature Geoscience.\u000a\u000aFollow Charles Q.

Those adults still fared better than those who were only getting six hours.\u000a\u000aResearchers emphasized that they didn't find a link between less sleep and poorer diets, nor did they prove a direct explanation as to whether less sleep caused you to gain weight or was the result of weight gain.\u000a\u000aFor more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.\u000a\u000aHousecall for Health, I'm Alex Hein, FOX News.

aVHe stomped over miniature bridges and buildings in a rubber suit and gave the world Godzilla, the fire-breathing, screeching monster that became Japan's star cultural export and an enduring symbol of the pathos and destruction of the nuclear age.\u000a\u000aHaruo Nakajima, who portrayed Godzilla in the original 1954 classic, died Monday of pneumonia, his daughter Sonoe Nakajima told The Associated Press on Tuesday. He was 88.\u000a\u000aThe film, which went on to become a mega-series and inspired Hollywood spinoffs, struck a chord with postwar Japan, the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombing, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the closing days of World War II.\u000a\u000aVivacious and energetic, Nakajima said he invented the character from scratch, and developed it by going to a zoo to study how elephants and bears moved. He said it was important to show the pathos of the creature, which could only smash everything in its way.\u000a\u000aThe theme of his Godzilla was grand and complex, he said, addressing universal human problems, as it spoke to a Japan that still remembered wartime suffering.\u000a\u000a"If Godzilla can't walk properly, it's nothing but a freak show," Nakajima said in a 2014 interview with the AP at his suburban Tokyo apartment, proudly sitting among sepia-toned photos of him as a young man and Godzilla figures.\u000a\u000a"It's not some cowboy movie," he said.\u000a\u000aHe recalled that the rubber suit he wore was so hot, especially under the glaring lights of the movie set, that the sweat he wrung from his shirt would fill half a bucket.\u000a\u000aIn the original movie, directed by Ishiro Honda with an unforgettable score by Akira Ifukube, Godzilla surfaces from the Pacific Ocean suddenly, a mutation as a result of nuclear testing in the area.\u000a\u000aNakajima was a stunt actor in samurai films when he was approached to take the role of Godzilla. Some fans prefer Nakajima's version over some Hollywood depictions, which they say resemble an evil-looking animal.\u000a\u000aAlthough recent Godzilla films use computer graphics, the latest Japanese Godzilla remake, released last year, went back to using a human actor, Mansai Nomura, a specialist in the traditional theater of Kyogen. His movements were duplicated on the screen through "motion capture" technology.\u000a\u000aUntil recently, Nakajima had continued to be a star guest at festivals and events. He had been scheduled to be featured at the Tokyo International Film Festival in October.\u000a\u000a"I am the original, the real thing," he said in 2014. "My Godzilla was the best."\u000a\u000aA funeral is to be held for family and close friends.

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

aVAnyone sweating it over the robot apocalypse will be delighted to learn that it probably won't be happening for a while, at least if Boston Dynamics' recent fail is anything to go by.\u000a\u000aThe company has built a deserved reputation in recent years for creating incredibly capable robots, among them BigDog, WildCat, Handle, SpotMini, and Atlas.\u000a\u000aAh yes, Atlas. Although this 5-foot 9-inch humanoid robot spends most of its time wowing us mere humans with its stunning ability to stroll nonchalantly across various kinds of challenging terrain as well as grab and effortlessly lift heavy objects, it recently had everyone laughing in the aisles after tripping over on stage and landing in a heap.\u000a\u000aThe unfortunate incident took place last month during a Boston Dynamics presentation at the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders. On stage, CEO Marc Raibert was showing off Atlas and SpotMini, a four-legged "robot giraffe" capable of picking up objects and carrying out various chores.\u000a\u000aDuring the slot, an assistant controlled SpotMini remotely, while Atlas used its sensors to get around. Keen to demonstrate Atlas's ability to lock onto an object and respond accordingly, the team placed a box on the stage for the robot to pick up. At first, its vision system failed to notice the box, which caused a few chuckles in the audience.\u000a\u000a"It's the normal course of business for things not to always work right," Raibert said, unaware that in a couple of minutes his words would ring even truer.\u000a\u000aA moment later, Atlas located the box, lifted it up, and put it back down again. The audience applauded in response.\u000a\u000aFor the next demo, the team decided to have some fun, getting SpotMini to move the box a little bit away from Atlas every time it bent down to grab it. Eventually SpotMini let Atlas take the box, and once again, the audience showed its appreciation.\u000a\u000aAs Raibert thanked SpotMini and Atlas for their efforts, Atlas wandered off toward the back of the stage, still holding the box. It seemed perfectly in control, confident in where it was heading, until it tripped on a stage light and went crashing to the ground, disappearing behind a curtain as it did so. SpotMini trotted over, seemingly curious to see if its buddy was OK.\u000a\u000aSeeing the funny side, Raibert quipped, "I wish I could pretend it was supposed to do that."\u000a\u000aKnowing Atlas's remarkable ability to steady itself if it gets shoved, its on-stage mishap may surprise some. The robot is actually capable of getting back on its feet after a fall, though we've know idea if Atlas managed it this time around. But with every unexpected tumble will come analysis and improvements, taking us another step closer to the day when robots have us for breakfast.\u000a\u000aBut until that happens, let's enjoy a couple more robot fails, such as this one by Honda's Asimo robot a few years back \u2026\u000a\u000aAnd this hilarious compilation of humanoid robots crashing down during a DARPA contest in 2015 \u2026

aVThe upcoming all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler will have more power than ever before. Not just under the hood, where three engines will be offered, but also on the roof.\u000a\u000aAccording to JLWranglerForums.com, the SUV has popped up the Jeep dealer ordering system months ahead of its unveiling, along with many details about it that have not yet been officially confirmed.\u000a\u000aAmong them are the availability of a \u2018power soft top\u2019 in addition to a variety of manual soft and 3-piece hardtop roofs. If it\u2019s what it sounds like, it would be the first power retractable top ever offered on the Wrangler from the factory.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aAlong with the roof, the data confirms that you\u2019ll be able to get the Wrangler with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, 3.6-liter V6 or 3.0-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder, all with fuel-saving stop start.\u000a\u000aThe inclusion of all of these features has been widely rumored in the build-up to the Wrangler introduction, but perhaps the biggest surprise spotted in the dealer system is an optional Selec-Trac full-time AWD system. That\u2019d be another first for the Wrangler that should appeal to its less hardcore off-roading owners (AKA: most of them) than the traditional four-wheel-drive system that will still be available.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s also something called a \u201cTrail Rail Management System\u201d listed that remains a mystery, but sounds like it could be some sort of cleverly-designed gear rack.\u000a\u000aStill no word on exactly when we\u2019ll see the production Wrangler in the flesh, but prototypes were recently spotted cavorting near Michagan\u2019s Silver Lake Sand Dunes.\u000a\u000aGary Gastelu is FoxNews.com's Automotive Editor.

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

aVWon't Back Down! Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly issued subpoenas to appear before the grand jury that he has convened to probe a meeting that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016. Two sources told Reuters of the move on Thursday, saying it was more proof that Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in last year's election was picking up speed. The former FBI director made headlines earlier in the day when it was revealed that he had impaneled a new grand jury to lead the probe. Trump Jr. and Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016 -- along with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- after being told that they would receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The meeting had been brokered by British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who has worked with the Trumps in the past.

Unable to hide the fact that he is white, Patinkin and the producers back down like good fearful liberals; the play - which features a diversity of talent - is now in jeopardy as ticket sales continue to drop.\u000a\u000aLeftwing madwoman Lena Dunham hears voices -- specifically, a conversation between flight attendants over their opinion on trans issues - and instead of confronting them, she narcs on them to their bosses. Like a paranoid member of some sort of regressive left secret police, she seeks to punish strangers over an unacceptable conversation she claims to have heard in her head.\u000a\u000aThe airline, however, can find no evidence that the conversation actually happened in real life, and are disputing the account. An investigation, which pokes a constellation of holes in Dunham's story, suggests she might have fabricated, or at the very least exaggerated the incident - much like her recent excuses for abandoning her dog at a pound, and assorted lurid tales she alleged in her desperate, attention-craving memoir. In each case, she wasted the time of responsible, employed men and women - time that could have been better used to deal with actual concerns, instead of indulging a fantasist.

aVUnder the wrong conditions, \u2018stop\u2019 could mean \u2018go faster\u2019 to an autonomous car.\u000a\u000aA new study led by the University of Washington found that the type of computer brain set to be used in autonomous cars could be fooled into thinking a Stop sign is a 45 mph Speed Limit or other sign by adding just a little graffiti.\u000a\u000aThe researchers peppered one Stop sign with a few black and white blocks, and used stickers to make another read \u201cLove Stops Hate.\u201d In both cases, the deep neural network processing images fed to it by a camera misread the signs most of the time, even though they retained their octagonal shape and red background color.\u000a\u000aAnother test simulated a slightly faded right turn arrow, which the computer often thought was a Stop sign or added lane sign, but which a human would have no trouble identifying.\u000a\u000aThe results varied by the position and distance of the camera relative to the signs, and would differ depending on what type of system is being targeted. Nevertheless, the researchers hope the work will help programmers develop better defenses against these types of attacks.\u000a\u000aAs a backup to this type of situation, driverless cars use several inputs, including hyper accurate GPS mapping, to help them avoid issues caused by confusing signage, but still need to sort out the data to make the correct -- sometimes life or death -- decision.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Sun, the researchers suggest this kind of 'contextual' information is of the utmost importance to the safe operation of autonomous cars.\u000a\u000aUNBELTED REAR SEAT PASSENGERS CAN KILL DRIVERS IN A CRASH

aVAutumn 1944. World War II is nearly over in Europe but is escalating in the Pacific, where American soldiers face an opponent who will go to any length to avoid defeat. The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. Killing the Rising Sun takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, Killing Patton, and Killing Reagan, this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before.

aVNorth Korea has threatened to retaliate against the U.S. after the U.N. unanimously voted to impose tougher sanctions but \u201cThe Coming Collapse of China\u201d author Gordon Chang said if the U.S. wants to damage the North Korean missile program, it must take aggressive financial actions.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThese sanctions are important \u2013 and kudos to Nikki Haley and to the Trump administration for putting them into place and getting 15-0 on the Security Council \u2013 but unfortunately these are incremental. These are just a little bit tighter than the previous six set of sanctions and the North Koreans are able to adjust around them,\u201d he told FOX Business. \u201cSo what we need to do, if we want to cripple the North Korean missile program, or even if we want to bring them to the table to talk, what we need to do is go all in all at once \u2014take all their money.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina is key to accomplishing this goal, in his opinion.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of countries that do business with North Korea but the other thing that it would take is going after Chinese banks because they have been money laundering for the North Koreans and not just the small ones, the big ones. Bank of China, one of China\u2019s so-called big four banks was named in a U.N. report last year for devising and operating a money clinging scheme for the North Koreans,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk down this street\u2026you will see a Bank of China branch and the question the Trump administration needs to ask is: Why can these guys launder money for North Koreans, do business in the U.S. and have access to dollar accounts in New York?\u201d\u000a\u000aIf the Trump administration were to get tough on China by sanctioning banks, Chang said America would have the upper hand but warns U.S. companies who sell in China, like Starbucks (SBUX) and GE (GE), will be hurt.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot allow the Chinese to continue to engage in increasingly predatory practices because it hurts American companies across the board. Not only the ones in China, but also of course, American workers. The other thing is, China is arming the North Koreans. So for instance, those launches on July 4 and July 28, the Chinese participated in them because those launchers were Chinese.\u201d\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on Mornings with Maria on Tuesday, Rep.

No longer are we trying to integrate China into the international system. What he is trying to do is protect the American people by disarming the North Koreans, if nothing else, that\u2019s a precondition to success.

aVThe lawyer for a British model allegedly abducted by "Black Death" kidnappers who intended to sell her to a buyer in the Middle East, hit back Monday over supposed holes in the 20-year-old beauty's story -- but acknowledged the woman left police with "understandable doubts."\u000a\u000aChloe Ayling said she was lured to Italy with the promise of a photo shoot, then drugged, stuffed into a suitcase, transported to an isolated farmhouse and held, at times in handcuffs, for almost a week.\u000a\u000aThe model told police the "terrifying experience" ended when her captor, who had threatened to hold her for ransom or advertise her as a sex slave on the criminal "dark web," decided instead to drop her off at the British consulate in Milan. Italian police have arrested a suspect in the bizarre series of events: a 30-year-old Polish man who claimed to be a paid killer.\u000a\u000aSince the story first broke, it has emerged that Ayling went shopping for groceries and shoes with her captor, raising questions about the degree of coercion she was under, The Guardian reported.\u000a\u000aAyling's lawyer acknowledged Monday that aspects of the case seem bizarre. Francesco Pesce told the Associated Press that investigators initially had "more than understandable doubts" about the model's story.\u000a\u000aA post shared by Chloe Ayling (@chloeayling) on Jun 28, 2017 at 8:31am PDT\u000a\u000aBRITISH MODEL SPEAKS OUT AFTER KIDNAPPING -- ALLEGEDLY BY MAN WHO WANTED TO AUCTION HER ON THE WEB\u000a\u000aIn a separate interview with the Guardian, Pesce said Ayling was scared to offer any resistance to her abductor\u2019s wishes, fearing there were other members of the gang who may have come after her.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were legitimate doubts [about her story] at the start, which were surpassed,\u201d Pesce told the Guardian. \u201cWhat Chloe told police during 10 hours, it wasn\u2019t easy on her.

Authorities said they have no evidence a ransom was paid.\u000a\u000aThen, on July 17, Ayling was dropped off at the British consulate in Milan. The next day, police arrested Herba, a Polish citizen with British residency.\u000a\u000aMilan police officer Lorenzo Bucossi said Herba described himself as a "paid killer" for a mercenary organization.

"I've feared for my life, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour."\u000a\u000aThis has not been the model's first brush with horrifying incident. Earlier this year, Ayling was reportedly caught up in a terror attack on the famed Champs-Elysee's in Paris where a police officer was killed.\u000a\u000aAyling had just arrived in the French capital and was walking on the street nearby when the incident unfolded, her agent told The Daily Star. The paper reported that model was told to get off the street and went back to her hotel to call her mother to tell her she was safe.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe did not know exactly what had happened, until turning on the internet on her phone \u2013 there she saw the news about the suspected terrorist attack in the center of Paris," Green told the Daily Star.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVHe cements the media\u2019s reputation as the opposition party.\u000a\u000aBy GEORGE NEUMAYR | The American Spectator\u000a\u000aIt is impossible to overstate the partisan jackassery of CNN, which is at once a product of the cynical, ratings-driven scumbaggery of its head Jeff Zucker and the pretentious liberalism of its \u201creporters,\u201d almost all of whom come from Democratic circles. What an astonishing collection of frauds. With their anchormanish baritones, they try to hoodwink viewers into thinking they are \u201cserious\u201d journalists. But they are all just liberal activists playing reporters on TV. Jake Tapper was a Dem staffer. So was Jim Sciutto. Christiane Amanpour, last heard lecturing journalists on the need to drop \u201cneutrality\u201d in its coverage of Trump, is married to former Clinton staffer James Rubin. And the list goes on and on.\u000a\u000aOut of this ethos came Jim Acosta, who, thanks to Trump, has justly become the face of fake news. Acosta\u2019s hectoring of Stephen Miller on Wednesday \u2014 behavior indistinguishable from a La Raza activist at a Trump rally \u2014 confirms once again the journalistic bankruptcy of Jeff Zucker\u2019s CNN. Acosta doesn\u2019t need any encouragement to be a demagogic jerk, but Zucker has no doubt flashed that green light to him. (By the way, where are the successors to the Kalb brothers to tsk-tsk Zucker for his complete abandonment of \u201cobjective\u201d journalistic conventions in pursuit of the cheapest of entertainment values? That even those old charades no longer occur is itself proof of the media\u2019s status as an unapologetic opposition party.)\u000a\u000aBut conservatives should thank Acosta for pulling off CNN\u2019s mask completely. It reveals the face of an exceedingly dumb and arrogant liberal. Poets, according to the windy adage, are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. But Acosta on Wednesday was determined to turn Emma Lazarus into an acknowledged one. He demanded to know why the Trump administration wasn\u2019t using her poem as the organizing principle of immigration policy.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVLarge U.S. business owners will be required to pay higher prices in order to provide health insurance coverage to their employees, a new study shows.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aAccording to an annual survey by the National Business Group on Health, the cumulative cost of providing medical and pharmacy benefits is expected to rise 5% in 2018 \u2013 up for the fifth consecutive year. Large U.S. companies are expected to have paid about $13,482 per employee in 2017 and that figure is forecast to rise to $14,156 next year. While employers will cover 70% of those costs, according to the survey employees could be responsible for about 30% \u2013 or $4,400 each in 2018.\u000a\u000aAs employers seek to temper rising prices, the National Business Group on Health survey identified specialty pharmacy as a primary driver of surging costs, with 26% of businesses listing it as their main concern. Increasing pharmacy costs were followed by high cost claimants and specific diseases or conditions.\u000a\u000aWhere other cost control mechanisms are concerned, companies have increasingly adopted new strategies to make health care more affordable, including telehealth services, Centers of Excellence and Accountable Care Organizations.\u000a\u000aAt the end of last month a Republican-led effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed to gain the necessary traction in order to pass the Senate.

aVThere\u2019s a palpable sadness in the air at Fox News Channel today. We learned over the weekend that one of our longtime fixtures, Rich O\u2019Brien, passed away.\u000a\u000aRich was a Sr. Vice President here and Creative Director. But titles didn\u2019t mean much to him\u2014everyone knew him as Rich\u2014the guy who gave Fox its distinctive on-air look.\u000a\u000aYou might not think much about graphics when you watch television, but Rich certainly did, and his keen eye and creative mind made Fox News better. He literally changed the look of cable news, not just at Fox, but at the competing networks as well\u2014when he\u2019d build a show open or create the animation to introduce a segment, the products were unfailingly eye-catching. They made you want to watch. Our competitors noticed, and soon they were trying to emulate what Rich was doing, while for his part, Rich was moving on to put something even more dazzling onscreen. He had that gift that drives so many creative people like him, the desire to look for and bring into being something better, something more interesting, some addition that helps tell a story. He\u2019d visit our studio during a live show, left hand propping up the right elbow, right hand in front of his chin. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d, he\u2019d wonder aloud. \u201cWhat if we moved that camera over there, and then put you here? Would that work?\u201d\u000a\u000aI remember once sitting in a recording booth here at Fox; Rich had asked me to be the voice of a very short promo his department was building. The script read, \u201cBefore it\u2019s history\u2026 it\u2019s news.\u201d Five little words. But for him, they had to have impact. They had to be just right. I\u2019m not sure how many tracks I recorded, but it was at least a dozen\u2026 maybe 15 or 20. Suddenly, he stopped me, his voice excitedly punching into the headphones I wore: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one!\u201d Five little words, but to satisfy Rich\u2019s inspired mind, they had to be delivered just so.\u000a\u000aOur company offers a small cafeteria in which employees can buy meals and snacks; I\u2019d often see Rich there in the mornings and we\u2019d sit together while I had a bagel and Rich ate\u2026 nothing. Mind you, he\u2019d already been at work for two to three hours by the time I was having my second cup of coffee. It wasn\u2019t the food that drew him; he just liked people and would sit with a couple of his graphic artists and sometimes me, ruminating about the state of the world. He was intensely curious and wanted to know what we thought, whether the topic was politics or real estate or the future of personal computing. I\u2019ve not known anyone\u2014especially someone charged with running a department at a major TV news operation\u2014who could be so upbeat every day. I might grouse about this event or that leader, but not Rich. The world seemed like one big wonderland to him, something to try to capture with his beloved camera and share with the rest of us.\u000a\u000aIf you really wanted to see his face light up, you\u2019d ask him about his family. He adored his wife Karen and their children, Katie and Connor. Now they\u2019ve lost a husband and father, and the rest of us have lost a really good guy and a creative genius. The people who worked for him loved him\u2014he gave a start, a first job, to dozens of animators and graphic artists.\u000a\u000aPeople ask me what happened and I know precious little. There was a bad car accident, some internal injuries that went undetected, then a coma and ultimately, death. It all happened so suddenly. At least Rich\u2019s family\u2014the family he loved so much\u2014was able to be with him to say goodbye when he passed away just a week shy of his 61st birthday. That\u2019s a gift, albeit a painful one, that many of us aren\u2019t able to experience.\u000a\u000aSo now I see him sitting at some breakfast table in heaven, wondering why we\u2019re all so downcast. He never seemed to have a bad day in his life and he certainly wouldn\u2019t want us mourning over him. I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019s intrigued by his new environment and is probably asking questions\u2014lots and lots of questions. I\u2019m sure the lighting there is quite good, the color spectrum divine and the landscapes, incomparable. No doubt, Rich is enjoying the look of the place. But knowing him, I suspect he just might have a couple of suggestions\u2026\u000a\u000aJon Scott serves as co-anchor for "Happening Now."

Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations.

The law could be at the center of the next big precedent-setting gun case if the Supreme Court takes up a challenge from Turner and others.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are hopeful that the Supreme Court will reverse this egregious decision,\u201d Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe Maryland law is one of a host of gun control measures passed in the wake of the 2012 Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre \u2013 and, if taken up, the case could have sweeping implications for like-minded states in the gun control debate.\u000a\u000aJay Porter, an attorney for the plaintiffs, complained about a patchwork of rulings in the wake of the landmark 2008 Heller decision upholding the individual\u2019s right to own a gun.

STRUGGLES TO IMPLEMENT NEW GUN CONTROL MEASURES\u000a\u000a\u201cWe would like to see a reversal in the trend of the lower courts,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAt best, there is a lot of confusion in the lower courts about the Second Amendment. At worst, lower courts are ignoring and resisting the Heller decision because they didn\u2019t like the outcome. That resistance needs to be mediated.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response to Newtown, 21 states passed some type of new gun control laws in 2013, according to a joint report by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign. Most didn\u2019t deal directly with buying or owning a firearm, but rather with background checks, record-keeping rules for gun dealers and other factors.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aHowever, four states\u2014California, Connecticut, Maryland and New York\u2014passed or strengthened bans on semiautomatic weapons in 2013. Those same four states, as well as Colorado, passed or strengthened bans on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\u000a\u000aThey were able to do so, in spite of the Heller decision, because of an interpretation that the 2008 ruling dealt largely with handguns, giving them leeway to restrict what critics call \u201cassault rifles.\u201d\u000a\u000aUntil a court rules otherwise, this might be the last type of existing legal gun ban.\u000a\u000aETHICS PANEL CLEARS DEM IN GUN SIT-IN\u000a\u000aBut Turner, of Hyattsville, and lead plaintiff Stephen Kolbe of Towson, Md., along with gun stores and gun-rights groups, are suing to overturn the Maryland law.

Then a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond ruled 2-1 the law wasn\u2019t constitutional.\u000a\u000aWhen Maryland appealed the decision to the full appeals court, a 10-4 majority determined, \u201c[W]e have no power to extend Second Amendment protection to the weapons of war that the Heller decision explicitly excluded from such coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe opinion went on to state, \u201cAt the same time, according to the state\u2019s evidence, the FSA-banned assault weapons have been used disproportionately to their ownership in mass shootings and the murders of law enforcement officers.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn July, the plaintiffs appealed their case to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aTheir petition noted that a 1989 report by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, described semiautomatic rifles as suitable for self-defense.\u000a\u000a\u201cHeller struck down a prohibition on the firearms most commonly chosen for self-defense\u2014handguns\u2014even though handguns are arguably more \u2018dangerous\u2019 than other firearms, and even though firearms other than handguns remained available for use in self-defense,\u201d the petition continued. \u201cThis court recognized and protected the principle at the heart of the interests enshrined by the Second Amendment: The individual \u2013 and not the government \u2013 retains the right to choose from among common arms those that they believe will best protect their person, family, and home.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor his part, Kolbe, a small business owner, first bought a semiautomatic handgun after an employee\u2019s boyfriend threatened to kill her at work and police did not respond for 30 minutes, according to court documents.\u000a\u000aMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh\u2019s office declined to weigh in on whether the Supreme Court would accept the case. \u201cThe court has not even decided to take the case at this point and our office does not want to get into speculation on consequences, particularly since this is ongoing litigation,\u201d Frosh spokeswoman Raquel Coombs told Fox News in an email.\u000a\u000aAfter the 4th Circuit upheld the law in February, Frosh heralded the ruling.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is unthinkable that these weapons of war, weapons that caused the carnage in Newtown and in other communities across the country, would be protected by the Second Amendment,\u201d Frosh said in a February statement.\u000a\u000aOther states are watching the case closely.\u000a\u000aAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming all filed amicus briefs on behalf of the plaintiffs.

Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.\u000a\u000aAll of us, presumably, know someone who was a tomboy as a child or adolescent or teenager and who remained or became very comfortable with her gender as a teenager or adult. It happens so often that tomboys turn into \u201cprincesses\u201d that it has become cliché.\u000a\u000aWhether one believes that transgender treatment in adults is defensible or not, I believe that sensible people must speak out against those who seem hell-bent on getting the word out to children and adolescents that they may be locked in the wrong bodies.\u000a\u000aNow, however, there is a real risk that any female who seems to \u201cact\u201d male and any male who seems to \u201cact\u201d female will be advised by a pediatrician, guidance counselor, therapist or teacher that she or he may not just gravitate toward activities typically reserved for the other gender, but might be the other gender.\u000a\u000aOnce that possibility has been presented, the door is open for young people to endorse it. They may then be routed to endocrinologists who place them on opposite sex hormones, preventing puberty. Yet, preventing puberty could commit those young people to journeys ending in castration or double mastectomy, when their journeys may have ended in being entirely content with their anatomy at birth.\u000a\u000aWhether one believes that transgender treatment in adults is defensible or not, I believe that sensible people must speak out against those individuals and organizations (including schools) who seem hell-bent on getting the word out to children and adolescents that they may be locked in the wrong bodies.\u000a\u000aThis is happening all over America, and not just with Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aJust this year, for example, Pingree School in Hamilton, Massachusetts, assembled its adolescent and teenaged students for a speech by an individual who had been female and had transitioned to being \u201cmale.\u201d The individual instructed all the students to close their eyes and imagine which gender they really were.\u000a\u000aNo one knows the effect of telling young people like the students at Pingree, many of whom were just then experiencing puberty, that they should consider whether their genitals ought be the opposite ones.\u000a\u000aMany organizations and individuals are abandoning science and common sense because they are convinced they can help children and adolescents by telling them that their gender may not correspond with their anatomy.\u000a\u000aAs a psychiatrist, I believe it is far more likely that they are harming those children and adolescents.\u000a\u000aDr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.

Boyden Gray, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation morph into an open-ended inquisition? Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations. Nor is there an obvious limit on their scope.

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages.

aVSomeone brought a dog to mass at my parish this weekend. It lay smack in the middle of the main aisle, forcing parishioners to edge around it. No one said anything, but the symbolism was not lost on some in attendance: dogs may be going to church, but the universal Roman Catholic Church is going to the dogs.\u000a\u000aUnder Pope Francis, the church has abandoned many of its bedrock positions on issues like divorce and homosexuality in favor of a \u201cwhy not?\u201d attitude. Francis has scolded people for being rich, sided with illegal immigrants, and suggested the church should be a refuge for the poor.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aHe has sidelined conservative cardinals, installed like-minded allies in key jobs, taken personal control of the Knights of Malta for defying him, and generally sent the signal that behind his amiable smile and humble talk lurks a radically liberal agenda.\u000a\u000aThe latest example of the pope\u2019s blueprint for the future is contained in an article penned by two of his closest confidantes. They believe that conservative Catholics in the United States have formed a coalition with Evangelical Protestants to push Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, which the authors call a \u201cManichean vision.\u201d The article, in the Jesuit publication La Civiltà Cattolica, could not have been printed without Francis\u2019s knowledge and approval.\u000a\u000aThe pope left little doubt about his feelings toward Trump when the president and first lady visited the Vatican earlier this year. In their joint photo, Francis frowns as if he smelled something bad in the room.\u000a\u000aIn addition to rejecting Trump\u2019s worldview, the article\u2019s authors single out White House strategist Stephen Bannon as a \u201csupporter of apocalyptic geopolitics.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pope is expressing his displeasure at the election of Donald Trump as president and with the Catholics who voted for him,\u201d says Deal Hudson, former Catholic Outreach director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt came as a huge surprise to the establishment of the church, who were pulling for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, says Hudson, the pope is wielding his power as CEO of the Church to tell American Catholics \u201cwe are bad Christians. This was his way of calling us a basket of deplorables without using that phrase.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis pope does not like the culture war,\u201d says Robert Royal, president of the Faith and Reason Institute and a commentator on the Catholic network EWTN. \u201cThe real tragedy is they\u2019re trying to discredit some types of religious action in the public square, while they are very active in advocating for the environment, immigrants and stopping human trafficking.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrancis can run the church any way he wants.

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data. If the sensor detects dangerous levels of radon for longer than 48 hours, it notifies the user and recommends what to do next. The sensor also gives audio alerts.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aIf high levels of radon are detected, experts recommend getting in touch immediately with a contractor who can implement a radon reduction system that will reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. It will set you back around $800-$1,200 \u2014 or more if the home has crawl spaces, no gravel under the slab or a completely finished lower level.\u000a\u000a\u201cEach state radon or radiation department should have a list of qualified contractors,\u201d Brodhead said. \u201cIt is usually best to have a local qualified contractor do the work to get better service.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrodhead recommends hiring a contractor who visits your home before submitting an estimate. He also advises getting more than one estimate and checking with references.

aVWhat began as one veteran driving around his northern California community looking for homeless veterans who he could help out, has blossomed into a full-fledged foundation with help pouring in from around the country.\u000a\u000aFox News was first introduced to disabled veteran Kyle Cornwell in March after a local Sacramento TV station did a story on the work he was doing.

This was my ultimate goal.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe foundation is called H3 Movement, or Heroes Helping Heroes. At the moment, Cornwell and a group of volunteers \u2013 up to 200 at any time \u2013 pile into their cars and drive around Sacramento and surrounding areas looking for veterans who are homeless and need help.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had weapons pulled on me and I\u2019ve been jumped several times, but it\u2019s not going to stop me,\u201d he said, recounting how he goes beyond the streets and underpasses to find people that need help. \u201cThere are so many vets that you don\u2019t see.

aVWith few good options available to deal with the growing threat from North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, the Trump administration scored a major victory on Saturday by getting the UN Security Council to unanimously impose the toughest sanctions ever on North Korea in response to its recent ICBM tests.\u000a\u000aBut as important as the new sanctions are, they will have little or no effect unless China fully complies with them and starts playing a much more active role in pressuring Pyongyang to cease its WMD programs and belligerent behavior.\u000a\u000aThe new UN sanctions reportedly will cost North Korean an estimated $1 billion \u2013 a third of its export earnings \u2013 mostly by filling loopholes in UN sanctions imposed last November that only put caps on iron ore and coal sales to China. The new sanctions outright ban iron ore, coal, lead and seafood exports from North Korea and increase banking sanctions as well as sanctions on North Korean persons and entities.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s blunt criticism of China\u2019s inaction and the president\u2019s indications that all options really are on the table may lead Beijing to reevaluate its North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aWhile these may be the toughest UN sanctions ever imposed on North Korea, China and Russia blocked several tougher measures sought by the United States. For example, the United States wanted to cut off Chinese oil exports to North Korea but Moscow and Beijing would not agree. They also blocked stricter banking and commercial penalties. In addition, because of Chinese and Russia opposition, the new sanctions bar North Korea from sending more workers abroad but North Korean laborers already working abroad \u2013 including many in China and Russia \u2013 won\u2019t be sent home. Similarly, only new \u2013 not existing \u2013 foreign investment and joint ventures in North Korea are banned by the sanctions.\u000a\u000aWhile these shortcomings are significant, the main factor that will determine whether the new sanctions succeed is China. Will China cooperate? Will Beijing step up pressure against Pyongyang like it has never done before?\u000a\u000aA major reason prior UN sanctions failed to have the intended effect on North Korea is because China failed to abide by them. China\u2019s trade with North Korea increased in the first quarter of 2017 by 37 percent and its iron ore imports from the North grew by 270 percent despite UN sanctions imposed on the Hermit Kingdom last November. China\u2019s violations of these and other UN sanctions provided Kim Jong Un with billions of dollars in hard currency that he spent on about 84 missiles tests since 2012 \u2013 including 17 in 2017 \u2013 and three increasingly powerful nuclear weapon tests.\u000a\u000aAlthough there have been recent reports that North Korea may have an operational ICBM and an H-bomb within two years, no one outside North Korea (except maybe the Iranians) knows exactly how advanced these programs are. However, Beijing, like the rest of the world, is worried about the rapid progress of these programs and knows they are on a dangerous trajectory that could spark a major war, possibly by miscalculation.\u000a\u000aChina also knows that unlike Barack Obama, who preferred doing nothing about difficult international problems and kick them down the road to the new president, President Trump sees North Korea\u2019s WMD programs and its repeated threats to attack the United States as an intolerable situation that need to be addressed now. Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt criticism of China\u2019s inaction and the president\u2019s indications that all options really are on the table may lead Beijing to reevaluate its North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aAs it has done so many times in the past, China today made the absurd claim that the United States bears some responsibility for tensions with North Korea and that these tensions could be reduced if the U.S. dropped joint military exercises with South Korea and withdrew U.S. troops from the South. But China\u2019s foreign minister also had \u201can intensive conversation\u201d with his North Korean counterpart Monday and publicly warned North Korea to \u201cnot violate the UN\u2019s decision or provoke the international society\u2019s good will by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is a good start that I hope indicates China\u2019s willingness to finally get tough with North Korea and stop violating UN sanctions. If North Korea defies these sanctions, the United States should demand imposing the tougher measures that Moscow and Beijing refused to include in them.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration should follow up with additional sanctions against North Korea outside of the UN and closely monitor sanctions compliance, especially by China. Any Chinese cheating on these measures should result in U.S. sanctions against the Chinese firms and persons responsible. The Trump administration should also continue to develop military options, pressure South Korea to deploy the THAAD missile defense system, and put on more shows of military force in the region.\u000a\u000aThe clock may be ticking down to a military conflict with North Korea. Hopefully Beijing realizes that strong and unambiguous Chinese pressure on Pyongyang may be the only way to prevent this from happening.\u000a\u000aFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a national security think tank.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVLess than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.\u000a\u000a\u201cNinety percent of the trade that North Korea has is with China.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026. [to] what's right for you," such as narrow or wide, Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aParents can turn off the camera if they choose to monitor only the sound. Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted. Parents can dress up Arlo Baby to look like a rabbit (with snap-on ears and feet) , a Dalmatian, or a cat.\u000a\u000aIt also records video, so busy parents don't have to miss milestones like their baby\u2019s first words or first steps.\u000a\u000a"If one parent is on the road, you can use your smartphone and get access to a live feed from the camera, and type in your password to get into the app and see what baby's doing at any time of the day," Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aUsers can talk to their babies when they\u2019re away, thanks to the monitor\u2019s two-way audio. Speak into your smartphone, and your baby will hear your voice on the monitor\u2019s speaker.\u000a\u000aThe camera can also be used to record or live-stream nannies and babysitters.\u000a\u000a"The most important thing you can protect is your family,\u201d Falgiano said, \u201cso being able to have tools to help monitor the child\u2026 and have it all tied in to [a smartphone experience] you're already using\u2026 we thought it made sense to bring that experience all together."

aVNot that long ago, you might have heard about an alarming concern with deodorant. People warned their friends through email and social media that these necessary antiperspirants cause breast cancer. Actually, some people even stopped using deodorant before this threat, such as Cameron Diaz who hasn\u2019t worn it in years! Before ditching your deodorant, though, you should understand the full story behind the concerns about deodorant and breast cancer.\u000a\u000aFirst, many people have worries about drugstore deodorants because of parabens. Recently, scientists performed a study which was published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology. The researchers took four samples of breast tissue from 40 women who had cancer. They found an interesting result.\u000a\u000aAfter analyzing the tissue, they found parabens in as many as 99 percent of the tissue samples. Even further, the scientists detected at least 5 parabens in 60 percent of the samples. In addition, some patients did experience breast cancer that formed in the armpit area while others did not.\u000a\u000aGETTING READY FOR COLLEGE? CONSIDER THESE VACCINES\u000a\u000aWith results such as these, you can see why both scientists and consumers are showing uncertainty. At the same time, this study doesn\u2019t clearly link the parabens as a cause of the breast cancer.\u000a\u000aSince the women experienced cancer in several locations, there also was no evidence that cancer resulted from paraben-containing deodorants. However, the results do warrant more research by scientists and health professionals.\u000a\u000aParabens: What Are They?\u000a\u000aEssentially, parabens are synthetic ingredients used in many personal care products and even foods. Companies favor them because parabens come with a low cost and act as a preservative that protects against mold and bacterial growth.\u000a\u000aBecause parabens can be absorbed through the skin, however, these ingredients can easily get into a person\u2019s bloodstream. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, researchers have found parabens in up to 99 percent of people in the US. Also, Scientific American states that up to 90 percent of common grocery products contain parabens, making it a hard synthetic to avoid.\u000a\u000aThe major reason for concern with these common ingredients is that parabens showcase weak estrogen-like qualities. Unbalanced levels of estrogen have shown to play a role in cancer, and parabens themselves may further cancer growth.\u000a\u000aIn one study, however, scientists actually grew breast cancer cells in a lab. Then, they combined parabens with another chemical to study the cancer\u2019s reaction.\u000a\u000aThey found that the cancer did indeed grow with the combined effect of parabens and another chemical. While the research does prove that parabens can fuel the growth of cancer under the right conditions, it still does not directly link them as a carcinogen.\u000a\u000aIS LIPOSUCTION SAFE FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES?\u000a\u000aIn defense, many health experts contend that the level of parabens in food and beauty products is too low to directly cause cancer. Furthermore, the research does not show that paraben-containing deodorants can increase the risk for breast cancer.\u000a\u000aHow You Should Respond\u000a\u000aSo what should you take away from this research? Consider this:\u000a\u000aIf you have no other concerns about using drugstore deodorant, you do not need to toss out your usual brand. People have been using paraben-containing deodorants for decades with no known damaging health effects.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, you could choose to avoid knowingly buying products with parabens as a safety net. One doctor from the Lankenau Medical Center in Pennsylvania, Marisa Weiss, MD, figures that it won\u2019t hurt anything to stay on the safe side. Weiss personally avoids products with parabens, keeping her products as natural as possible.\u000a\u000aWhile parabens are undergoing some scrutiny lately, studies have not found a direct link to the low levels of parabens in deodorant and breast cancer. In fact, many deodorants have stopped using parabens as an ingredient, reducing the cause for concern anyway. If you still have uncertainties, you can choose more natural deodorants to stay on the safe side.\u000a\u000aDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor. He also serves as chairman of the department of obstetrics/gynecology and reproductive science at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.

aVAmazon wants to deliver stuff to customers using drones, but it needs to to get the infrastructure in place first to have a chance of making it happen. As well as a large green light from the Federal Aviation Administration.\u000a\u000aWhile it's been making steady progress with the design of its Prime Air flying machine, it's also been filing numerous patents detailing ideas related to various aspects of its proposed delivery service.\u000a\u000aThey've included an extraordinary "beehive" drone tower that would operate in urban areas and manage multiple drones on delivery runs across the city. And how can we forget the wacky flying warehouse idea, essentially a blimp housing an Amazon warehouse and drone airport.\u000a\u000aThe latest Amazon idea to land on the desk of the United States Patent and Trademark Office is for a network of multi-purpose mobile facilities capable of maintaining drones and acting as a hub for deliveries. Interestingly, the facility would be located on trains, ships, and other kinds of vehicles, enabling its delivery drones to be rapidly deployed to areas where customer demand "is known or anticipated," whether through purchasing patterns "or events that are scheduled to occur in such areas."\u000a\u000aThe mobile units would be able to launch and receive drones while the vehicle is in motion, the patent filing said. A diagram (below) included in the submitted papers shows a shipping container with an open top and a drone hovering above it as the unit travels along a railroad.\u000a\u000aAmazon\u000a\u000aAmazon envisions such a facility being "loaded with replacement parts and/or inspection equipment, and configured to conduct repairs, servicing operations or inspections on aerial vehicles." Once a drone has been repaired or had its battery replaced, robots would be able to load it with a delivery and send it on its way.\u000a\u000aThe idea is similar in some ways to an Amazon patent that surfaced in 2016 showing how it could use street lights and the top of church steeples as docking stations for its drones, allowing the flying machines to stop off for a battery charge to allow it to cover greater distances on a delivery run.\u000a\u000aDrone deliveries from mobile units isn't a new idea either, as UPS has already tested such a service, although Amazon's plan seems rather more complex.\u000a\u000aIt should be noted that it's by no means certain Amazon's idea will ever see the light of day. Its grand drone delivery project is still in its early stages, though these patents do offer some insight into the company's thinking when it comes to building the infrastructure for any future sky-based delivery service.

aVA Texas professor is making waves on social media after protesting the state's campus carry law by wearing protective combat gear to class.\u000a\u000aSan Antonio College geography instructor Charles K. Smith went to his class last week sporting a camouflaged bulletproof vest and helmet. He said he wore it because he doesn\u2019t feel safe.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt definitely makes me feel uneasy that there are more firearms on campus than there should be,\u201d Smith told mySA.com. \u201c[Dressing this way] was just a statement on how I felt.\u201d\u000a\u000aCampus Carry, which was signed into state law in 2015 and officially implemented into Texas community colleges on Aug. 1, allows individuals with a conceal license to carry a handgun on college premises. The law went into effect at 4-year institutions in 2016.\u000a\u000aA photo of Smith wearing the combat gear was shared on Facebook, which generated a flurry of comments in favor of and against the professor.\u000a\u000a\u201cI realize students were carrying guns on campus illegally, but now it\u2019s legal to do so. It increases the chances of something happening,\u201d said Smith, who also acknowledged that no one had pulled a gun on him in his 10 years at the college.\u000a\u000a\u201cUsed to, when they got mad at me, they had to go home to get the gun and had time to cool off.

aVBy Walt Heyer, The Daily Mail\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he wouldn\u2019t allow transgender individuals to serve in the military:\u000a\u000aAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... \u2014 Donald J.

Thank you \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\u000a\u000aI think he made the right decision\u2014and as someone who lived as trans-female for several years, I should know.\u000a\u000aWhen I discovered Congress voted earlier this month to not block funding for transgender-related hormone therapies and sex change surgeries, I wondered if it considered how devastating this will be to the fitness, readiness, and morale of our combat-ready troops.\u000a\u000aIn July, the House of Representatives voted down Missouri Republican Rep. Vicky Hartzler\u2019s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which would have banned the military from funding such treatments.\u000a\u000aPaying for transition-related surgeries for military service members and their families is beyond comprehensible.\u000a\u000aPerhaps they have forgotten that our military was forged to be the world\u2019s strongest fighting force, not a government-funded, politically correct, medical sex change clinic for people with gender dysphoria.\u000a\u000aGender dysphoria, the common diagnosis for one who feels at odds with his or her birth gender, develops from prolonged anxiety and depression. People are not born that way.

aVBy Frank Miniter, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aAn IT scandal involving perhaps dozens of Democrats in Congress is advancing so fast that it can be hard to keep up with the details \u2013 especially given that so much of the media is ignoring or downplaying the story.\u000a\u000aThe story exploded last week when congressional IT staffer Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington as he was about to fly to Pakistan. Awan, who was employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-Fla.), was charged with bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty. But the story only begins with alleged bank fraud.\u000a\u000aHere are 10 shocking things we know right now about the scandal.\u000a\u000a1. Awan was arrested after wiring $283,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to Pakistan. Officials charged him with defrauding the credit union of $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application.

aVBy Dr. Keith Ablow | Fox News\u000a\u000aNew Planned Parenthood guidelines for parents now advise that children as young as four years old be informed that having a penis or a vagina doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are male or female. Why? Because, Planned Parenthood argues, how could parents know whether their children are transgender?\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, this is incredibly dangerous advice.\u000a\u000aChildren of four or five or six or ten are not psychologically equipped to grapple with the notion that their genitals could be misaligned with their psyches. Introducing that concept could, theoretically, lead to unconscious questions about whether anything in the world is for certain, spawning all manner of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.\u000a\u000aA little boy told that his penis may or may not be something that he lives with for life could certainly be traumatized by that doubt. A little girl who is informed that she might not be a girl for the rest of her life could certainly wonder whether she will have a mother, for the foreseeable future, or whether her mother might opt to become a man.

aVBy Steve Cortes | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe song Chicago, made famous by Old Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, refers to Chicago as a \u201ctoddlin\u2019 town.\u201d Sadly today, thanks to decades of dreadful leadership, Chicago more resembles a \u201ctottering\u201d town, as in a place nearing collapse.\u000a\u000aLet me preface my indictment of Chicago and particularly Mayor Rahm Emanuel with the important disclaimer that I love this city and I\u2019ve raised a family here for two decades. If cut, I would bleed the orange and navy of the Monsters of the Midway, my beloved Chicago Bears.\u000a\u000aBut no amount of hometown affinity can color the reality of a city in systemic decline. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that from 2015 to 2016, Cook County \u2013 where Chicago is located \u2013 lost more people than any county in America. A U-Haul rental from Chicago to Texas can cost as much as six times more than the return trip, an indicator of the heavy outward flow of people. It\u2019s no wonder people vote with their feet and escape the endemic corruption, escalating taxes, and rampant crime. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly on Fox News, Chicago is certainly the most dangerous place in the developed world, with over 2,200 shooting already this year.\u000a\u000aSo what is Mayor Emanuel doing to address this migration out of our city? How is he ameliorating the mammoth $838 million property tax increase that\u2019s crushing disposable incomes in our city? Is he searching for solutions for the most under-funded pension system in America, obligations that will cripple our budget in just a few years? Is Rahm empowering police to stem the bloody carnage that afflicts the streets, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods?

aVTry as they might, the infection control specialists at Royal Brompton Hospital could not eradicate the invasive fungus that was attacking already gravely ill patients in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aEnhanced cleaning didn\u2019t stop the dangerous bug from spreading from one patient to the next in the 296-bed hospital. Neither did segregating infected patients, to keep them from spreading the fungus.\u000a\u000aEventually, officials who run the Royal Brompton, located a couple of miles from Buckingham Palace in London\u2019s tony Chelsea neighborhood, resorted to a last-ditch move no hospital ever wants to have to take. They temporarily shut their ICU. That appears to have put a stop to the more than year-long outbreak, which ended last year and which involved at least 50 patients.\u000a\u000aThe lengths to which the Royal Brompton was forced to resort to rid the hospital of Candida auris \u2014 a member of a broader fungal family named Candida \u2014 raised red flags for the small community of scientists who study fungi that infect people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey did the Cadillac of drastic actions to make that happen, which we generally wouldn\u2019t be doing for Candidal infections,\u201d Dr. Tom Chiller, the chief of mycotic \u2014 fungal \u2014 diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT in a recent interview.\u000a\u000aBACK TO SCHOOL: HOW TO AVOID SCABIES INFECTION IN CHILDREN\u000a\u000aThe fear is that that\u2019s what U.S. hospitals may be facing if C. auris breaches their infection control defenses. Last year at this time, the CDC knew of a single U.S. case, which occurred in 2013. As of mid-July, the case count had risen to 98 in nine states, though the lion\u2019s share have been reported by two \u2014 New York (68) and neighboring New Jersey (20).\u000a\u000aOn the ever-growing list of bad bugs, C. auris is one of the most unsettling. Dr. Anne Schuchat, who served as the CDC\u2019s acting director this spring, termed it a \u201ccatastrophic threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aSaid Chiller: \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for really sick people right now and we at CDC are taking a very aggressive approach to see if we can\u2019t control, contain, and even eradicate it from the places it exists.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut doing that won\u2019t be easy.\u000a\u000aMost fungal infections are acquired when a person picks up the fungus from the environment. But it seems C. auris can be transmitted from person to person, at least in a hospital setting. The fungus is hellishly difficult to eradicate from a space, once it settles in. And some versions of it seem to be impervious to the drugs \u2014 the dismayingly few drugs, it must be noted \u2014 that combat fungal infections.\u000a\u000aMore on this... She's got a radical approach for the age of superbugs: Don't fight infections. Learn to live with them external-ct\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s almost a perfect storm kind of organism. It has all the bad characteristics of a large number of bad pathogens,\u201d said Dr. Alex Kallen, a medical officer with the division of health care quality promotion at the CDC.\u000a\u000aThe resistant strains of the fungus seem to be as robust as the non-resistant strains \u2014 which is a disappointment and a concern. Often organisms that develop resistance pay a price; they are weakened in the process and don\u2019t spread as well. But with this fungus there is no \u201cfitness\u201d tradeoff for acquiring resistance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s again another scary thing about it. Because we don\u2019t want fit resistant organisms,\u201d Chiller said.\u000a\u000aNone of these dire characteristics was apparent when the fungus was first detected, in 2009. Then it was simply a new fungus grown from discharge swabbed out of the ear of a 70-year-old woman in a Japanese hospital.\u000a\u000aFinding new additions to the fungal family tree is not uncommon; nor is it considered alarming, generally speaking.\u000a\u000aBut then the radar pinged again. Some scientists in Pakistan were investigating puzzling bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients that they thought were caused by another type of yeast, called Saccharomyces. They shipped samples to Atlanta in the hopes the CDC could help. The culprit was actually C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat caught our attention,\u201d Chiller admitted. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019re like, \u2018Huh? Candida auris? A cluster that big in a hospital?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aOther countries started reporting cases. In fairly short order after the Japanese report, countries on three continents disclosed having seen infections caused by this fungus.\u000a\u000aThe widespread and virtually simultaneous appearances of C. auris raised suspicions that travelers were moving the fungus around \u2014 but that turned out not to be accurate. Comparing genetic sequences from various places showed different strains in each place \u2014 a phenomenon that remains a bit of a mystery. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s one thing,\u201d said Kallen, when asked how to explain the dissemination of the fungus.\u000a\u000aTo be clear, C. auris isn\u2019t the zombie apocalypse. Healthy people aren\u2019t going to be felled in the street by this fungus.\u000a\u000aIn fact, like lots of other pathogens, some of us carry Candida fungi on our skin \u2014 C. auris seems to especially like the warmth of armpits and the groin. As is true with other bugs, this fungus doesn\u2019t generally cause problems when it\u2019s on the outside of a healthy person being kept in check by other bugs with which it shares human turf.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s when someone gets sick that C. auris can become a problem. The fungus can infiltrate the bloodstream \u2014 wending its way into the body along a catheter or an intravenous line used to deliver fluids and medicines. When that happens, sick people become a lot sicker.\u000a\u000aWHAT IS 'LEAKY GUT' -- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT?\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that about five or six out of every 10 people that have been seen to be infected with C. auris die. Chiller cautioned, though, one cannot say the fungus kills 50 percent or 60 percent of its victims. As often is the case with secondary infections \u2014 bugs that infect people who are already fighting off another serious ailment \u2014 it can be tough to determine who died \u201cfrom\u201d the fungus, and in whom the infection merely contributed to the death.\u000a\u000aKeeping C. auris from getting into and spreading within hospitals is the big goal here. But it\u2019s likely to prove challenging. At the Royal Brompton, in London, doctors found that when a patient with C. auris was moved out of a hospital room, the next patient to move in would pick up the fungus. Even after cleaning, the fungus could be found on multiple surfaces \u2014 the bed, the floor \u2014 in the room.\u000a\u000aThe team of researchers there who investigated the outbreak declined requests for interviews.\u000a\u000aDr. Curtis Donskey, chief of infectious diseases at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, has been studying C. auris in the laboratory, trying to determine how long it can survive on surfaces in hospitals and which cleaning regimens can effectively destroy it.\u000a\u000aIn an upcoming paper, he and colleagues will report that the disinfectants most commonly used in U.S. hospitals are not that effective against this fungus.\u000a\u000aThey also found that C. auris is able to live on surfaces for at least seven days. And that is probably not the end of the C. auris story. \u201cWe certainly suspect that they would last longer than that,\u201d Donskey said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how long we tested.\u201d\u000a\u000aAware of this problem, the CDC has recommended hospitals use bleach to clean rooms that housed patients with C. auris. But that\u2019s not a fail-safe solution. \u201cWe found more of it on moist surfaces that are not typically cleaned with bleach at all,\u201d said Donskey, pointing to sink drains.\u000a\u000aAnd bleach isn\u2019t the easiest of cleaning regimens. \u201cIt\u2019s damaging, it doesn\u2019t smell good, causes occupational health issues,\u201d CDC\u2019s Kallen said.\u000a\u000aLikewise, there are surfaces hospitals might not think to clean between every patient that can harbor the bacteria \u2014 for instance, the privacy curtains that separate patients in a multi-bed room.\u000a\u000aAdopting the enhanced cleaning techniques used to control C. difficile \u2014 a bacteria that forms a spore and is also challenging to control \u2014 should help with C. auris, said Donskey.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s hoping, though, that the lessons hospitals learned as they battled that bacteria \u2014 for example, clean those privacy curtains after a patient with C. difficile is moved out of a room \u2014 will give them a head start in the era of C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the environment is much more appreciated now than it was a decade ago as a source for transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we would do the same things if we see Candida auris that we already are very well used to for trying to control C. diff and other pathogens.\u201d

Today, all you really need to lock and unlock your front door are vocal chords and a simple word: \u201cAlexa.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmazon Smart Home, the company\u2019s home security program, has been around since 2014, but only recently has it started working with voice recognition.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000a\u201cSmart Home is something that\u2019s been around for a long time,\u201d said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Smart Home at Amazon, \u201cbut it turned out that customers had to fish in their pocket to control their home. Pull out the remote control, find the appropriate app, find the right page in the app and click a button just to do something as simple as turning on a light.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow Amazon has moved to a different approach, one that emphasizes simplicity. Instead of pulling out your phone and tapping the screen several times, all you have to do is say, \u201cAlexa, unlock the door.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmazon now has hundreds of products that offer Alexa skills, and hundreds more are being added every month. Many of them are dedicated to home security, including smart locks like Dwelo and Kevo, which allow users to unlock their homes via voice command even when they\u2019re not near the door. Others, such as August Smart Lock, will lock the door too, when you tell Alexa your pin code. Amazon Echo also connects to home security systems such as Scout, Alarm.com and SimpliSafe. Some require paid plans to sync with Alexa, but one system, abode, has a no-fee plan that lets you tell Alexa to arm and disarm your system.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aAnd then there\u2019s ADT, which was founded in 1874 but is hardly dated when it comes to technology.

And now there\u2019s a new addition: the Echo Show ($229.99), which has a 7-inch screen that plays media, can be used for video calls and adds a visual element to Alexa-controlled home security. Ask Alexa to show you the front door or a child\u2019s bedroom, and Echo Show pulls up a live feed from a camera. \u201cWe use Echo Show at my home to make sure we understand who is coming in and out of the house,\u201d said Rausch.\u000a\u000aCurrently the Echo Show only works with home security cameras such as Arlo by NETGEAR and Ring video doorbells, but Amazon is adding to the list.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe see Alexa as the great simplifier in the home,\u201d said Rausch. \u201cYou can ask Alexa, \u2018Is my door locked?

There\u2019s also the $179 Awair Baby, designed for nurseries in Ocean blue or Baby Rose.

HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aIndoor air can be five times as polluted as outdoor air, according to Awair, and people \u2014 whether they\u2019re in a hotel room that\u2019s been cleaned with harsh chemicals \u2026 or in a packed and poorly ventilated meeting room with rising levels of carbon dioxide \u2026 or in an older home with low-quality paint and carpeting that leaks chemicals into the air \u2014 often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re inhaling toxins.\u000a\u000aAwair monitors the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, chemicals and dust in a room, and when any of them reach unhealthy levels \u2014 indicated by a color code on the display \u2014 it notifies an app that recommends solutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe always jokingly say in the office, \u2018The only people who need Awair are those who breathe air,\u2019\u201d says Ro. \u201cMany people don\u2019t think about air because they don\u2019t see it, but the fact is that we wouldn\u2019t drink dirty water, but so many of us breathe dirty air.\u201d\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aThe Awair app also provides tips and recommended courses of action from the Mayo Clinic. For example, it may suggest placing a peace lily, which removes airborne chemicals, in a bathroom with a high chemical score.

aVFrom the bestselling team of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard comes Killing Reagan, a page-turning epic account of the career of President Ronald Reagan that tells the vivid story of his rise to power -- and the forces of evil that conspired to bring him down.\u000a\u000aJust two months into his presidency, Ronald Reagan lay near death after a gunman's bullet came within inches of his heart. His recovery was nothing short of remarkable -- or so it seemed. But Reagan was grievously injured, forcing him to encounter a challenge that few men ever face. Could he silently overcome his traumatic experience while at the same time carrying out the duties of the most powerful man in the world?\u000a\u000aTold in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton, Killing Reagan reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in the California governor's mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan's most heroic actions. In Killing Reagan, O'Reilly and Dugard take readers behind the scenes, creating an unforgettable portrait of a great man operating in violent times.

aVSeeing official-looking renders of the Galaxy Note 8 is nice, but now Samsung's new flagship is ready for its real close-up.\u000a\u000aThese new shots (first published by MyEverDayTech) seem to confirm both the good and the bad Galaxy Note 8 rumors that we've been hearing for weeks.\u000a\u000aOn the bright side, the Note 8's top and bottom bezels look just as thin as those of the Galaxy S8, and the back of the phone features dual camera lenses, which will enable optical zoom and other tricks.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the Note 8 in these photos also features a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. While we will reserve judgement until our in-depth review, this placement has proven awkward on the S8 and S8+. Fortunately, the flash in this case can act as a bit of a buffer.\u000a\u000aOther notes to take away from these images include a virtual home button (just like the S8 smartphones), and that the left and right edges of the handset appear to be less curved than previous Note handsets.\u000a\u000aWe expect to learn more about the Note 8 at a Samsung event slated for August 23, where the company is expected to reveal the flagship device.\u000a\u000aCredit: MyEveryDayTech via Android Police

aVOver the last six months the Trump administration has made good on its promise to enhance border security and enforce our immigration laws. In the first half of 2017, illegal border crossings fell by an estimated 70 percent. It is very reassuring to know that President Obama\u2019s reckless immigration policies are now over. An Executive Branch that is dedicated to fixing the problems along our southern border and actually enforcing our laws not only deters future illegal immigration, but is also absolutely necessary to protecting our homeland.\u000a\u000aHowever, we are constantly reminded that our borders and our immigration laws are still being exploited, including by those who are intent on doing Americans harm. For example, MS-13, a violent transnational gang controlled by members in El Salvador, has aggressively recruited minors who entered illegally at our southern border during recent surges of illegal immigration. Known for its brutal tactics of rape, theft, and homicide, this gang now has tens of thousands of members in cities all across the United States.\u000a\u000aThese dangers are not always brought on by transnational gangs however. In late July, a 65-year-old woman from Portland, Oregon, was assaulted by an illegal immigrant armed with a knife. The assailant had been previously deported over a dozen times. How did this man keep sneaking into our country and why are some localities undermining the enforcement of our immigration laws and their communities\u2019 safety?\u000a\u000aFurther, nine illegal immigrants were recently found dead in a sweltering tractor-trailer parked outside of a Walmart in Texas. Tragically, dozens more were sent to a nearby hospital; some with life-threating conditions. They were the victims of a heinous human smuggling operation.\u000a\u000aWe cannot be a safe nation if we have porous borders and our laws are not being fully enforced.\u000a\u000aViolent criminals, traffickers, drug smugglers, and international terrorists continue to do everything they can to break into America, creep into our neighborhoods, and take advantage of our society. This is completely unacceptable. We cannot be a safe nation if we have porous borders and our laws are not being fully enforced. We must tackle these problems head on.\u000a\u000aFortunately, we have introduced two important pieces of legislation in the House of Representatives that work together as a united front to strengthen our border security, strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws, and provide the Department of Homeland Security with the personnel and resources it needs to get the job done.\u000a\u000aThe Judiciary Committee has passed Representative Raùl Labrador\u2019s, R-Idaho, Davis-Oliver Act, named for two law enforcement officers from California who were killed by an illegal immigrant. This legislation removes the ability of any future president to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement by empowering state and local authorities to help enforce our immigration laws. State and local authorities are the front line in the fight against crime and encounter criminals every day in their communities. We must ensure that they are able to identify the drug dealers, murderers, drunk drivers, and spouse-abusers who are illegally present and work with federal immigration enforcement authorities to ensure their punishment and removal.\u000a\u000aThe legislation also withholds certain federal grants from jurisdictions that illegally prohibit their officers from cooperating with ICE; allows victims of crimes by illegal aliens to sue localities in instances where the locality\u2019s refusal to cooperate with ICE facilitated the crime; makes membership in a gang a deportable offense; and calls for additional ICE officers to enforce our laws; among other important provisions. This legislation is a necessary step towards keeping our communities safe.\u000a\u000aThe Homeland Security Committee\u2019s Border Security for America Act is a multi-layered approach that enhances the security of our southern border in a number of important ways.\u000a\u000aMost notably, this bill authorizes the construction of a border wall and provides $15 billion for the deployment of tactical infrastructure, technology, and other measures to achieve full operational control and situational awareness. President Trump repeatedly said that a wall was an important part of securing our border and this legislation will help make that happen. However, a wall will not solve this problem by itself.\u000a\u000aThis legislation improves and modernizes ports of entry to target illegal immigration while enhancing trade, authorizes the National Guard to assist with aviation intelligence support, and will ensure identification of visa overstays by requiring implementation of the Entry-Exit system Congress enacted over two decades ago to track the entry and exit of foreign nationals visiting our country. It also provides more boots on the ground by adding 5,000 Border Patrol Agents and 5,000 Customs and Border Protection Officers. We can have strong walls, solid intelligence, and advanced technology, but our strongest asset in the fight to control our borders are the brave men and women who patrol our borders.\u000a\u000aThe American people have made it clear that they want to see their leaders implement policies that will protect their families and their neighborhoods. A weak border and immigration laws that can be easily circumvented only allow new dangers to enter our country and threaten our citizens. Let\u2019s work together and pass these common sense proposals that will better enforce our nation\u2019s immigration laws and provide all Americans the secure border they have long demanded and deserve.\u000a\u000aRepublican Michael McCaul, represents Texas' 10th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He serves as chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.\u000a\u000aRepublican Bob Goodlatte represents Virginia's 6th congressional district in the House of Representatives. He is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
