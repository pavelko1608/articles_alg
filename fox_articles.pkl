aVGOP mayoral candidate Nicole Malliotakis mocked Mayor de Blasio on Thursday, saying he should go back to using his given German name after his refusal to defend statues of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.\u000a\u000aShe made her point while standing under the explorer\u2019s statue in Columbus Circle, which has become the focal point of a cultural battle after Hizzoner said he\u2019d appoint a commission to recommend hateful city monuments for removal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI really think Bill de Blasio should go back to using his birth name of Warren Wilhelm, because he obviously doesn\u2019t have the heart and soul of an Italian,\u2019\u2019 Malliotakis said of de Blasio, who is half-Italian.\u000a\u000aMalliotakis, who is half-Greek and half-Cuban, has said Columbus statues should stay.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio has strongly embraced his Italian heritage after adopting his mother\u2019s maiden name as a young adult \u2014 even visiting his ancestors\u2019 homes in Italy during his first year as mayor.

aVIn a fiery polemic on our personal finances, Gerri Willis, anchor and personal finance correspondent for Fox Business News, reveals how liberal policy has decimated our wallets.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Rich Is Not a Four-Letter Word, veteran financial journalist and pundit Gerri Willis takes on the progressive mind-set championed by liberals that gives government bureaucrats the right to decide what's best for us, resulting in bigger government programs, more bureaucracy, and more wasted taxpayer money. She dissects Obamacare and Democratic tax initiatives to show how they have hamstrung the average American. Then she shows us how to overcome these left wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the topics she tackles in the book: (1) How the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom (a new Blackrock survey shows that 4 out of 10 Americans haven't even started saving for retirement)--and how to get it back; (2) How the wide-open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year--and how we can successfully navigate the system; (3)How, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored health-care coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies have begun to abandon employee health-care coverage and opt to pay a less expensive federal penalty; (4) Why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.

aVYou got lost hiking in the woods and you finished all the water you carried in with you. Now that you\u2019ve found the trail again, you\u2019re hot and thirsty and worried about dehydration. There\u2019s a stream up ahead. Is the water safe to drink?\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re pounding the pavement in an unfamiliar city on a very hot day. Can you trust the public water fountain? Come to think of it, can you trust the one in your office building?\u000a\u000aNow there\u2019s a water bottle that will answer those questions \u2014 and even purify the water, if necessary. And if it sounds ludicrous to shell out more than $200 for such a thing, ask yourself this: How much are you willing to pay for peace of mind?\u000a\u000a\u201cWater is life, but water pollution has become a nationwide problem,\u201d says Eric Li, the founder and CEO of Ecomo, maker of the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d water bottle.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Li, who also has a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, referred to a Harvard University study conducted last year that found unsafe levels of toxic chemicals in drinking water in 33 states, including California, New Jersey, Florida and New York. Among those chemicals were PFASs (polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances), which have been linked to hormonal problems, obesity and cancer.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why Li invented the Ecomo (short for \u201ceco-monitor\u201d) Bottle.\u000a\u000aThe stainless steel bottle tests water for contaminants and, if it\u2019s not up to snuff, removes them quickly to make it safe to drink.\u000a\u000aUnlike one of its competitors, CamelBak\u2019s All Clear ($99), which uses UV technology to purify unsafe water in 60 seconds, Ecomo uses a complex filtration system that does the job in less than five seconds. It took Li and his team two years to create, but for the consumer it\u2019s as simple as fill, shake, twist and drink \u2014 unless the water is already fine for drinking, in which case you can eliminate \u201ctwist.\u201d\u000a\u000aUsers can fill the bottle at practically any source: tap, pond, even toilet \u2014 and then activate its testing mechanism by shaking it. The bottle\u2019s filtration system, composed of carbon and ion exchange fibers and a nanofiber membrane, analyzes four things: the TOC (total organic carbon) level, the TDS (total dissolved solids) level, turbidity or cloudiness and water temperature. If the water is good to drink, a green light and the word \u201cGood\u201d appear on the bottle\u2019s LED monitor. If it\u2019s contaminated, as indicated by a yellow or red light and the word \u201cFair\u201d or \u201cBad,\u201d a twist of the bottle\u2019s base will reduce bacteria, pesticides, petroleum products and heavy metals by up to 99.9 percent.\u000a\u000aThe bottle weighs 13 ounces and has double-layer insulation designed to keep water hot for 12 hours or cold for 24 hours. It holds 20 ounces of water \u2014 and only water. Filling it with another liquid can damage the bottle\u2019s analyzer. The first bottles aren\u2019t expected to ship until late this year, but Ecomo has already caught the attention of Tech Insider, Gear Junkie and Fast Company, which called it \u201can invention for our increasingly poisonous world.\u201d\u000a\u000aEcomo Bottle is currently available for pre-ordering on the crowdfunding website IndieGoGo, where it\u2019s discounted to $139. Ecomo has raised nearly $600,000 \u2014 more than nine times its goal since the campaign launched in October \u2014 and it\u2019s on IndieGoGo\u2019s Must-Have Products for Your Office list.\u000a\u000aEventually, Li says, the goal is to get the bottle into stores, where the retail price will be $220. It could be the most expensive water bottle on the market, but it will also be the only one of its kind.\u000a\u000aChloe Li, Ecomo's vice president of marketing (no relation to Eric), describes Ecomo\u2019s core customers as people in their 30s to mid-40s who care about their health and are aware of the latest trends in technology. They\u2019re people who don\u2019t mind recharging batteries \u2014 the Ecomo Bottle\u2019s battery lasts up to a week and takes an hour to recharge \u2014 and buying replacement filters for $10 every two to three months.\u000a\u000aThe Ecomo has an app that notifies users when it\u2019s time to buy a new filter and a Bluetooth wristband that measures environmental conditions like the temperature, records users\u2019 daily activities to calculate their hydration needs and then keeps track of their water intake throughout the day.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnlike many other hydration trackers, it will not be a rough estimate based on a predefined average daily consumption of an average person,\u201d said Chloe Li. \u201cSo it\u2019s much more accurate.\u201d\u000a\u000aEcomo also aims to collect data on water quality throughout the U.S., and eventually the world, through crowdsourcing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want a place where everybody can receive data on their water quality at any time,\u201d said Eric Li. \u201cWhen a user takes a measurement and presses the bottle\u2019s \u2018send\u2019 button, the water quality data collected will be sent to the Ecomo website and used toward a real-time water quality map.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut first, Li has to oversee the distribution of the Ecomo Bottle and his other product, Ecomo Fount, which is scheduled to be released in September. Mounted on a kitchen faucet, Ecomo Fount will test for and filter the same four things as Ecomo Bottle, and it will come with a free app, Ecomo Lab, that will chart results by the month to show users the history of their water quality. The data will be synched to the cloud and uploaded to a water quality map so users can see the scores of the water around them.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re human \u2014 and chances are very good that you are \u2014 then your body is roughly 60 percent water. How nice to know it\u2019s clean.\u000a\u000aKatie Jackson is a travel writer. When she's not working, she's chasing after a Leonberger named Zeus.

aVHurricane Harvey will distort measures of the U.S. economy in weeks and months ahead. Everything from jobless claims, which already surged in a report on Thursday, to gross domestic product and inflation, will be knocked off course by the storm.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aThe storm will make it difficult for economists to gauge the trajectory of the economy, with brief spikes across a wide range of reports. It will be hard to discern whether bad reports result from storm damage and then whether good reports owe to the effects of rebuilding. It could be well into 2018 before the storm's effects have fully washed out of the economic data.\u000a\u000aForecasters in The Wall Street Journal's survey of economists estimate the storm will affect the most important economic reports at the national level in the months ahead. They expect the storm to reduce the pace of job gains by about 27,000 jobs a month in the third quarter on average, followed by little change in the fourth quarter and then a boost of 13,000 in the first quarter 2018, as many people find work in the rebuilding process.\u000a\u000aThe growth rate of gross domestic product will fall by about 0.3 percentage points in the third quarter, they expect, followed by no effect on the fourth quarter, and an 0.2 percentage point boost in the first quarter of 2018.\u000a\u000a"The devastation in the surrounding Houston area, America's fourth-largest city, will be significant enough to negatively impact activity and employment nationally, especially in the third quarter, but some of those effects will be transitory," said Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "...I would expect the Houston economy and its all-important energy sector to be quite resilient moving forward."\u000a\u000aEstimates of the storm's national economic impact remain preliminary -- and Hurricane Irma, which is currently headed for Florida, could exacerbate the effects. Beginning this week, a growing number of economic indicators will show Harvey's impact, from jobless claims, to inflation, to retail sales, to housing starts and beyond.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aIn the longer run, the storm is expected to have no lasting impact, with forecasts for gross domestic product, unemployment, inflation and other major economic indicators unchanged for 2018 overall, according to the survey of 56 business, financial and academic economists from Sept.1 to Sept. 5. In the months ahead, here is where economists say to watch for the storm's distortions.\u000a\u000aJobless Claims\u000a\u000aEarly evidence of the hurricane's impact on the U.S. job market came Thursday, when the Labor Department reported the largest one-week jump in initial jobless claims since the aftermath of superstorm Sandy in November 2012. It is likely only the beginning of a spike in unemployment filings.\u000a\u000aIn the weeks after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012, jobless claims were highest not during the week of the storm, but two weeks after. Many who were out of work from the hurricane waited until the storm had passed to file their claims.\u000a\u000aCompared with the week of the storm, initial jobless claims rose 23% in the second week after superstorm Sandy and 30% in the second week after Hurricane Katrina.\u000a\u000a"Irma's right behind Harvey, so that could cause claims to spike again," said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics.\u000a\u000aInflation\u000a\u000aMeasures of inflation will soon reflect Harvey's impact, with gasoline prices spiking due to disruptions to oil refineries in the Houston area. The national average gas price was $2.66 a gallon on Wednesday, according to the AAA, up from $2.35 a month ago.\u000a\u000aDenton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst of Oil Price Information Service, sees gas prices peaking near $2.75 before leveling off.\u000a\u000aEnergy prices make up 7% of the consumer-price index, with motor fuel accounting for nearly half of that. Already, the move in gas prices could raise the inflation rate by about 0.5%. With past major storms, the effect has faded within a few months.\u000a\u000aConsumer spending\u000a\u000aWith gas prices up, consumers across the country will have less cash for everything else. Every penny increase in gasoline prices reduces consumer spending by $1 billion over the course of the year, according to Mr. Sweet of Moody's.\u000a\u000a"Consumers are going to feel it in their pocket," Mr. Sweet said.\u000a\u000aConsumer-spending measures may also show the impact of Houston being shuttered for so long. The city of Houston has nearly three million workers and produces about $500 billion a year of gross domestic product.\u000a\u000aThat is "a non-negligible economic impact, assuming 25% of Houston area output was idled for seven days," said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.\u000a\u000aHousing\u000a\u000aBefore the storm, Texas was on track for a 14% increase in housing starts this year, according to James Gaines, chief economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Houston alone accounted for about 4% of the nation's permitted housing. All that activity will grind to a halt as builders wait for construction sites to dry out, assess the market and compete for construction workers to rebuild and repair the city.\u000a\u000aHousehold Wealth\u000a\u000aDestruction of homes and businesses doesn't show up in gross domestic product, but it would show up in measures of household wealth. A complication from Hurricane Harvey is that many homeowners and businesses didn't carry flood insurance, meaning that a large share of the over $100 billion in estimated damage could reduce household wealth.\u000a\u000a"With so many homeowners uninsured, this is more akin to a wipeout of assets such as one would expect from a stock-market crash," said Constance Hunter, chief economist for KPMG, the accounting firm."The effects are more negative and widespread."\u000a\u000aBut in a $19 trillion economy with 150 million workers, many of the effects will be hard to tell apart from the usual churning of such a large nation. Economic indicators can only measure so much of a storm's effect.\u000a\u000aUltimately, "the impact on individual lives will dwarf the economic dollar losses," said Lynn Reaser, a former Bank of America economist who is now a professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.\u000a\u000a--Laura Kusisto contributed to this article.\u000a\u000aWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey will distort measures of the U.S. economy in the weeks and months ahead, making it more difficult for economists and policy makers to gauge its trajectory at a sensitive time for the Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aEverything from jobless claims, which already surged in a report on Thursday, to gross domestic product and inflation will be knocked off course, with brief spikes across a wide range of reports, economists say.

aVHurricane season is taking its toll on the southern U.S. and the commercial drone industry is becoming a major player in disaster relief efforts.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey and now Hurricane Irma, the FAA issued permits to commercial drone operators to assist in a number of different functions that expedited the recovery process.\u000a\u000aOne of the crucial ways drones are helpful is in getting the electrical grid up and running again in areas crews cannot access, either because the surrounding spaces are flooded or power lines are down.\u000a\u000aHURRICANE IRMA: STUNNING VIDEO SHOWS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PASS OVER THE STORM\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were down there [Houston] doing energy restoration work for about eight days and what we were doing is we were going out to areas that folks couldn\u2019t get to where we could easily fly a drone. We had worked with the FAA for permissions, we were flying on emergency certificates of authorization. We\u2019d fly out over areas working with folks in the energy industry to make assessments and then help primarily concentrating on safety\u201d, said James Fleitz, co-founder of drone services company Avisight.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey is projected to become the costliest natural disaster in the U.S. Financial analysts have estimated $160 billion dollars in damages, exceeding that of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u000a\u000aDrones are being used to assess a lot of that damage, especially by insurance companies. Allstate and Farmers Insurance are using their own company drones to make damage assessments. It speeds up the process so insurance companies can pay claims to customers much faster than they normally would with multiple person crews scoping out the extent of losses.\u000a\u000aHURRICANE IRMA: AIRCRAFT CAPTURE STUNNING SHOTS OF MOON SHINING IN THE EYE OF THE STORM\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it a two billion dollar catastrophe or a ten billion dollar catastrophe, a lot of times that\u2019s not known very quickly, this is a technology that can help to make that process go a lot faster and also help to respond to their main customers quickly too and get them their money," said Peter Fuchs, co-founder of drone manufacturer Ascent Aerosystems.\u000a\u000aWhile helpful in certain aspects, drones can\u2019t assist in traditional helicopter efforts. Drone operators are cautious not to interfere with normal search and rescue operations, but experts say integration is key to being successful, which means that everyone on the ground has to be on the same page.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s not just about capturing a lot of data, it\u2019s about capturing the critical data and getting it to the right people at the right time,\u201dsaid Ed Hine, vice president of business development at Hazon Solutions, which oversaw a fleet of drones assisting in Houston.

Throughout the episode, we are not-so-subtly reminded that liberals are the tolerant, kind, good guys while conservatives are hateful, bigoted, and conscienceless. The show sets up a classic good vs. evil, and the Trump supporters are very bad indeed.\u000a\u000aNot only do they go overboard to make Trump supporters look bad, they are juxtaposed against the hero worship of liberals to create a sharp dichotomy. As promised, the episode, aptly named "Election Night," kicked off with real news coverage of Donald Trump (at his worst) and Hillary Clinton (at her best). We then go to Michigan were we meet same-sex married couple Ally (Sarah Paulson) and Ivy (Alison Pill) watching the election results with neighbors and having a meltdown.

aVOn Sept. 8, a Category 4 hurricane made landfall in the U.S. \u2013 killing thousands of people and leaving behind lasting devastation.\u000a\u000aThe hurricane, which became known as the Great Storm, ravaged Galveston, Texas, in 1900 \u2013 exactly 117 years before Hurricane Irma, the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s most potent storm that is expected to continue its trek across the Caribbean and slam into Florida.\u000a\u000aBetween 6,000 and 12,000 people died in 1900 after the massive storm hit the southern Texas island, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report. More than 3,500 buildings were destroyed.\u000a\u000aThe storm brought with it darkness, winds up to 140 mph and a 15-foot surge of water, according to the Houston Chronicle. It destroyed the commercial city that sat less than 9 feet above sea level, at the time home to 35 churches, 30 hotels, 484 saloons and the biggest opera house in Texas.\u000a\u000aSeveral people drowned and many others were killed by flying debris as they tried to escape, according to accounts.\u000a\u000aThe storm was able to wreak so much havoc, in part, because of the nation\u2019s unpreparedness at the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cSophisticated weather forecasting technology didn\u2019t exist at the time, but the U.S. Weather Bureau issued warnings telling people to move to higher ground. However, these advisories were ignored by many vacationers and residents alike,\u201d said History.com.\u000a\u000aHURRICANE IRMA'S STORM PATH: WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW\u000a\u000aIsaac Cline, the Galveston chief U.S. Bureau Meteorologist at the time, thought the Texas town would be able to withstand a hurricane because of the shallow waters along the beach, according to the Chronicle. Cline\u2019s pregnant wife perished during the storm.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe drifted for three hours, landing 300 yards from where we started. There were two hours that we did not see a house nor any person, and from the swell we inferred that we were drifting to sea, which, in view of the northeast wind then blowing, was more than probable,\u201d Cline recounted in a Sept. 1900 report.\u000a\u000aThe storm caused a new focus on studying hurricane prevention, according to NOAA.\u000a\u000aA large seawall was eventually built to protect Galveston from future storms and flooding \u2013 and it did its job during hurricanes in 1961 and 1983, according to History.com.\u000a\u000aGALVESTON WAS REFUGE FOR NATION'S ORPHANS, BEFORE AND AFTER DEADLY 1900 HURRICANE\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that a sea wall, which would have broken the swells, would have saved much loss of both life and property,\u201d Cline said in his report.\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma, which has already destroyed many island towns in the Caribbean, is about 450 miles southeast of Miami, Fla., as of Friday morning. It\u2019s traveling west-northwest at approximately 16 mph.\u000a\u000aIrma was downgraded to a powerful Category 4 storm Friday morning.

aVNew Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state said Friday he will remain on an advisory commission to President Donald Trump though he disagrees with voter fraud allegations made by the panel\u2019s vice chairman about his state.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aAll four members of New Hampshire\u2019s congressional delegation called on fellow Democrat and Secretary of State Bill Gardner to step down from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in response to a Breitbart column by Republican Kris Kobach published Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKobach, commission vice chairman and Kansas secretary of state, said newly released data about how many people failed to get New Hampshire driver\u2019s licenses after using out-of-state licenses for voter registration is proof of fraud that likely led to U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan\u2019s victory over Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in November.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire\u2019s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes,\u201d Kobach wrote. \u201cNow there\u2019s proof.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe \u201cproof\u201d Kobach referred to was data showing that of the 6,540 people who registered to vote in New Hampshire on Election Day in November using out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses, only 15 percent had acquired New Hampshire licenses by this month. But state law allows someone to be domiciled in New Hampshire for voting purposes and be a resident of another state for driver\u2019s licensing purposes \u2014 for example, students attending college in New Hampshire.\u000a\u000aDemocrats accused Kobach of misleading the public by using irrelevant data to rehash false claims.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000a\u201cSecretary Gardner\u2019s association with this partisan commission risks tarnishing his long legacy of fighting for the New Hampshire Primary and promoting voter participation, and it would be in keeping with his distinguished record to immediately relinquish any role with this commission,\u201d Hassan and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement.\u000a\u000aGardner, the nation\u2019s longest-serving secretary of state, countered by questioning whether the senators quit committees they\u2019re assigned to in Congress because they disagree with other members.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre they going to refuse to participate in anything? Don\u2019t they try to deal with it? Don\u2019t they try to have a dialogue,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aGardner said he doesn\u2019t condone Kobach\u2019s claims but will remain on the commission because it\u2019s important to figure out why Americans are losing trust in the election process. Nothing less than the fate of American democracy is at stake, he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cDemocracies go away when people no longer trust the very basic part of democracy, which is the ability to cast a vote for the people you want to represent you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they lose faith in that process, it goes away. That\u2019s how democracies die.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump created the commission in May to investigate allegations \u2014 offered without evidence \u2014 that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. The president also has claimed he lost New Hampshire in November because thousands of people came by bus from other states to vote against him.\u000a\u000aThe commission, which is meeting in New Hampshire on Tuesday, has requested any records considered public by states, including driver\u2019s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers, though no state is supplying every item on the list and some are refusing to comply altogether. New Hampshire is sending millions of scanned, unsearchable images of public voter data: names, addresses, party affiliations and whether someone has voted.\u000a\u000aGardner said critics should not rush to judgment.\u000a\u000a\u201cJudge it when it\u2019s over. Don\u2019t try to destroy it before it even has a chance to begin, because if we can\u2019t get to the facts ... then we\u2019ve missed an opportunity, and it\u2019s just slash and burn,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the facts to speak for themselves in this. I would really like to get to the facts, and I would like to get there by whatever means it\u2019s going to take.\u201d

aVAmericans are losing faith in the value of a college degree, with majorities of young adults, men and rural residents saying college isn't worth the cost, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey shows.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aThe findings reflect an increase in public skepticism of higher education from just four years ago and highlight a growing divide in opinion falling along gender, educational, regional and partisan lines. They also carry political implications for universities, already under public pressure to rein in their costs and adjust curricula after decades of sharp tuition increases.\u000a\u000aOverall, a slim plurality of Americans, 49%, believes earning a four-year degree will lead to a good job and higher lifetime earnings, compared with 47% who don't, according to the poll of 1,200 people taken Aug. 5-9. That two-point margin narrowed from 13 points when the same question was asked four years earlier.\u000a\u000aThe shift was almost entirely due to growing skepticism among Americans without four-year degrees -- those who never enrolled in college, who took only some classes or who earned a two-year degree. Four years ago, that group used to split almost evenly on the question of whether college was worth the cost. Now, skeptics outnumber believers by a double-digit margin.\u000a\u000aConversely, opinion among college graduates is almost identical to that of four years ago, with 63% saying college is worth the cost versus 31% who say it isn't.\u000a\u000aBig shifts occurred within several groups. While women by a large margin still have faith in a four-year degree, opinion among men swung significantly. Four years ago, men by a 12-point margin saw college as worth the cost. Now, they say it is not worth it, by a 10-point margin.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aLikewise, among Americans 18 to 34 years old, skeptics outnumber believers 57% to 39%, almost a mirror image from four years earlier.\u000a\u000aToday, Democrats, urban residents and Americans who consider themselves middle- and upper-class generally believe college is worth it; Republicans, rural residents and people who identify themselves as poor or working-class Americans don't.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that college graduates, on average, fare far better economically than those without a degree. For example, the unemployment rate is 2.7% among college graduates, compared with 5.1% among high school graduates who never attended college, and Labor Department research shows that bachelor's degree recipients earn higher salaries than those who never went to college. But the wage premium of getting a degree has flattened in recent years, Federal Reserve research shows.\u000a\u000aStudent debt has surged to $1.3 trillion, and millions of Americans have fallen behind on student-loan payments.\u000a\u000a"Costs have gone up considerably to the point that I think there are a number of people who maybe rightfully say, 'I'm not in the league of Harvard and maybe not even in the league of really good state schools,'" said Doug Webber, a Temple University econimics professor. Many of those Americans are concluding that paying high tuition at less-prestigious schools isn't worth it.\u000a\u000aSome Americans believe learning a trade offers more security than going to college.\u000a\u000aJeff McKenna, a 32-year-old from Loveland, Colo., said he doesn't believe college is worth the cost. Mr. McKenna went to a trade school, earning a certificate as a mechanic, and now earns a base salary of about $50,000 a year. He said he's never gone three weeks without a job, including during the recession.\u000a\u000a"I have friends from high school that are making half what I'm making, and they went and got a four-year degree or better, and they're still $50-, $60-, $70,000 dollars in debt," Mr. McKenna said. "There's a huge need for skilled labor in his country."\u000a\u000aGrowing skepticism of college, along with a strong labor market, are possible factors behind a decline in collegeenrollment this decade. Many schools have responded by cutting tuition or offering more scholarships.\u000a\u000aSchools such as Michigan State, the University of Wisconsin system and the University of Florida are trying to improve their public standing with marketing efforts. In Wisconsin, the university system has taken out billboards across the state highlighting the impact alumni have had on the local economy.\u000a\u000a"We're aware of the various polls that show this decline in confidence. It's happening across a wide variety of institutions," said Heather Swain, Michigan State's vice president for communications and brand strategy. "One of the things we're doing is to try and make sure people understand the value of the university in different ways."\u000a\u000aThe turn in public opinion is "somewhat startling to me," said University of Florida Provost Joseph Glover.\u000a\u000a"I think this is happening," he said, "because there is a disconnect between the group of Americans who go to university and acquire an appreciation of life-long learning and another group people who never get access and never really understand the benefits a university brings to society at large."\u000a\u000aDr. Glover said the school sees its job as supplying the intellectual capital the state need to grow.\u000a\u000a"The political winds can always change," he said, "but we believe we're providing tremendous value to the state."\u000a\u000aWrite to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com and Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com

aVBy Burgess Owens | Fox News Opinion\u000a\u000aAs we enter a second season of protest of our country\u2019s flag by young, wealthy black NFL athletes, millions of fans will continue to turn off America\u2019s favorite past time. The NFL, whose brand was once our country\u2019s most uniting one, is rapidly re-branding itself as a divisive one. In a sport where a player\u2019s lack of decorum deemed detrimental to the game \u2013 such as celebrating in the end zone \u2013 is met with harsh penalties, the NFL\u2019s corporate leadership has taken a knee as they allow their platform to be used for political anti-America sentiment.\u000a\u000aIt is possible that by visiting our past, Americans might gain insight as to why successful black American athletes feel compelled to kneel as we honor our flag and white corporate leaders refuse to take a stand to defend it.\u000a\u000aIn a world where slavery, totalitarianism and kingdoms were the accepted norm, the young American experiment was indeed a paradox. Though it was America that introduced to the world game-changing concepts like \u201cWe The People\u201d and \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\u201d it would take another 87 years and over 600,000 American lives to atone for slavery and to begin to align itself with our Founders\u2019 vision.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, there was another reality for millions of African slaves whose experience mirrored that of a young African boy brought to America in 1848. He arrived in the belly of a slave ship and was sold with his mother at an auction house in Charleston, South Carolina. Orphaned by age eight, his harsh, abusive and deprived American experience was just beginning.\u000a\u000aHow can our nation reconcile the depravation of that young eight-year-old slave with inspirational success stories of other Americans during that same century?\u000a\u000aFor an example, the American culture that granted opportunity to a middle-aged Texan, a Republican, whose \u201cfederally protected\u201d freedom allowed him to pursue his dreams, to work, risk, overcome and to prosper. Respected as a pillar of his community, he was a successful entrepreneur who owned over 100 acres of farmland, which he paid off within two years. He also founded the first church and elementary school in his region of the state. He was referred to as fiercely independent and a very proud American.

aVBy Ned Ryun, Fox News\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t make it up. After seven years of promising conservative voters they would repeal and replace, and raising tens of millions off the issue, Republicans are now doubling down in support of ObamaCare. In fact, they are actually going to make ObamaCare worse.\u000a\u000aHow so?\u000a\u000aAs impossible as it may seem to believe, Republicans in Washington and the states are working to bail out ObamaCare and simultaneously bring back ObamaCare tax increases that Barack Obama himself suspended because they were driving up health care costs.\u000a\u000aLet that sink in.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of their faux attempt to repeal ObamaCare, many Establishment Republicans have embraced ObamaCare\u2019s so-called cost-sharing subsidies. Commonly known as CRSs, these subsidies are payments the federal government makes to insurers to help offset the high costs of ObamaCare customers.\u000a\u000aJust a few years ago, House Republicans actually sued the Obama administration over CSRs, arguing, correctly, that the payments were unconstitutional because they had never been authorized by Congress. Permanent authorization of CSRs is now the top health care priority for Congressional Democrats.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aAmerica's post World War II euphoria was shattered in the summer of 1950, when North Korean communist forces invaded democratic South Korea. The Korean campaign of 1950-1953 has been called the "Forgotten War." More than 1.7 million Americans served in Korea and over 35,000 of them died there fighting at places like "Bloody Ridge," "Pork Chop Hill" and "Heartbreak Ridge." These were the treacherous "hill battles" known for some of the most brutal combat in military history. They fought for hills that were sometimes smaller than a football field.\u000a\u000aIn this exciting episode of "War Stories with Oliver North," you'll meet some of the heroic men who survived this unbelievable carnage. You'll hear how one trapped soldier stacked frozen enemy torsos to protect himself from enemy artillery fire. And yet another soldier vividly remembers a face on a hill that haunts him today. And you'll meet the man who would later be portrayed by screen legend Gregory Peck in the classic war drama, "Pork Chop Hill."

aVAmerican citizens have always been the backbone of ambitious solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems. The twenty-first century has seen an unprecedented rise in generosity and a steep decline in global poverty. In The Quiet Revolution, readers are invited inside the White House to see how presidents have aided in this success by rallying Americans to serve their nation by volunteering in their local communities and around the world.\u000a\u000aPresident George W. Bush\u2019s Faith-Based and Community Initiative was a catalyst for many of these dramatic social improvements. Yet, the big story is not what happened in Washington, D.C., but rather what takes place in countless communities across the nation. There is not a social problem in America that is not being addressed by a faith-based or community group every day.\u000a\u000aThe Quiet Revolution is about championing the unsung work of ordinary volunteers spurred by faith and simple goodwill to roll up their sleeves in order to care for their neighbors in need.

aVThe House on Friday gave final approval to a $15 billion Hurricane Harvey relief bill that includes a short-term suspension of the debt ceiling and funding to keep the government running for the next three months, sending the measure to President Trump\u2019s desk.\u000a\u000aThe package passed on a 316-90 vote, with all opposing votes coming from Republicans.\u000a\u000aCongress moved with uncharacteristic speed on the bill to avert several looming crises \u2013 the prospect of not only triggering a government shutdown, but hitting the debt limit as the federal government burns through cash it needs to respond to both Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma which is barreling into Florida.\u000a\u000aThe $15.25 billion approved Friday represents an initial payment as Texas recovers from its devastating storm and residents across the southeast brace for impact from Irma \u2013 a storm sure to require billions more from the federal government.\u000a\u000aSeparately, the package includes money to fund the government through Dec. 8, while suspending the debt ceiling through that same period. The package was the product of a stunning deal earlier this week between President Trump and congressional Democratic leaders that angered many GOP lawmakers.\u000a\u000aLeaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had wanted to strike a longer-term deal \u2013 instead, the short-term arrangement virtually guarantees a showdown in December. Some conservatives, meanwhile, were angry about attaching any debt-ceiling increase that doesn\u2019t include spending reductions.\u000a\u000aAll 17 senators who opposed the bill in the Senate a day earlier were Republicans, just like on the House side Friday.\u000a\u000aAhead of that vote, the Trump administration dispatched Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to Capitol Hill to make the case to House Republicans.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest bloc of conservatives in the House, had written to Ryan on Thursday opposing the measure.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile some have advocated for a \u2018clean\u2019 debt limit increase, this would simply increase the borrowing authority of the government while irresponsibly ignoring the urgency of reforms,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorse yet is attaching the debt limit to legislation that continues the status quo or even worsens the trajectory on spending, such as the deal announced yesterday by the President and Congressional Leadership.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe suggested a slew of changes that could win Republicans votes, such as repealing ObamaCare and a balanced budget amendment.\u000a\u000aThe bill still was able to pass with a combination of GOP and Democratic votes.\u000a\u000aFox News is told Trump struck the short-term deal since he wants to clear the agenda so Congress can focus on tax reform. He reiterated that goal on Twitter Friday morning, saying, \u201cRepublicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!\u201d

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data. If the sensor detects dangerous levels of radon for longer than 48 hours, it notifies the user and recommends what to do next. The sensor also gives audio alerts.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aIf high levels of radon are detected, experts recommend getting in touch immediately with a contractor who can implement a radon reduction system that will reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. It will set you back around $800-$1,200 \u2014 or more if the home has crawl spaces, no gravel under the slab or a completely finished lower level.\u000a\u000a\u201cEach state radon or radiation department should have a list of qualified contractors,\u201d Brodhead said. \u201cIt is usually best to have a local qualified contractor do the work to get better service.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrodhead recommends hiring a contractor who visits your home before submitting an estimate. He also advises getting more than one estimate and checking with references.

The Travelers Championship. Or the USC Traveler. Any Traveler, really.\u000a\u000aEPSN should also no longer provide coverage of the PGA Travelers Championship to avoid distressing sensitive viewers with the mention of Confederate General Robert E. Lee\u2019s infamous horse, Traveller, on which he rode into many battles in defense of the South.

It seems like Honda put more effort into this one vehicle than the rest of its lineup combined. And yes, it still has a lightning bolt on the side.\u000a\u000aThe zig-zagging window line is sleeker than last time around, as is the entire Odyssey, which has sculpted body sides and a \u201cfloating roof\u201d like just about every new vehicle these days.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also larger, yet lighter, than the old one, and it\u2019s powered by the same lively 280 hp V6 as the Pilot, but comes with a new 10-speed automatic transmission in high end models. These include the Elite that I tested and had no problem getting my kids into with the promise of its Blu-ray-equipped widescreen entertainment system and Wi-Fi hotspot.\u000a\u000aLesser Odysseys, and the Pilot, use a 9-speed transmission that\u2019s been criticized for being a little clunky, so you might think adding a gear would make things worse. It doesn\u2019t. The 10-speed is flawless. You don\u2019t even notice it\u2019s hard at work keeping the engine in its sweet spot as much as is possible without 11 gears.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s partly because everything is so quiet in the Odyssey\u2019s cabin, which is slathered in soft-touch materials and metallic trim. The latest Chrysler Pacifica upped the game in minivan refinement when it debuted last year, but the Odyssey outdoes it in many respects.\u000a\u000aThe Pacifica\u2019s trump card is still its hideaway Stow \u2019n Go second-row seats that fold into the floor, but the Odyssey\u2019s optional Magic Slide captain\u2019s chairs are removable and can be pushed together to create a two-person bench. They also tilt and slide for easy third row access with a child seat installed, and they have a jump seat that can be installed between them to turn the Odyssey into an eight-passenger school-run ace.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aWith their seats in the upright position, the Odyssey is more spacious than the Pacifica, especially in the cargo area behind the third row. There, in Touring and Elite trims, you will find a built-in vacuum cleaner with a hose long enough to reach all corners of the cabin. The Pacifica also offers one, but Honda was first with this feature in the last-generation Odyssey. Keep in mind that both are dry-vacs. You still need to keep a roll of paper towels handy for spills.\u000a\u000aAll Odysseys above the entry-level LX, which starts at $30,930, now come standard with Honda Sensing, a package of semi-autonomous electronic driver aids that includes emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and an aggressive lane-keeping assist system that\u2019s not quite hands-off, but does help keep the Odyssey in its lane while your eyes are off the road.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aIf you have children, you will be doing that from time to time to check out a unique piece of tech called Cabin Watch, a breakthrough in mobile parenting that delivers live video of what\u2019s going on behind the driver\u2019s seat and works while the vehicle is moving. Of course, once the kids figure out where the camera is, the feed basically turns into \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d To make it easier to convince them to quiet down back there, Cabin Watch is bundled with a Cabin Talk public address system that amplifies your voice so you don\u2019t need to raise it. The fidelity of the audio is pretty terrible and makes you sound like an evil overlord, but that could work to your advantage.\u000a\u000aDespite being stuffed with all of the above, the Odyssey rides and handles better than any other minivan and will often have you forgetting you\u2019re even in one. There\u2019s none of the flexing and creaking that having two huge sliding door openings usually causes, and it feels big only when you\u2019re trying to park it.\u000a\u000aIt is long, however, and has a big diaper butt hanging behind the rear wheels that is the unmistakable mark of a minivan, regardless of how stylish and modern the rest of it may be. But if you can deal with the shame, you will be rewarded for your bravery.\u000a\u000a----------\u000a\u000a2018 Honda Odyssey\u000a\u000aBase price: $30,930\u000a\u000aAs tested: $47,610\u000a\u000aType: 8-passenger, front-wheel-drive minivan\u000a\u000aEngine: 3.5-liter V6\u000a\u000aPower: 280 hp, 262 lb-ft\u000a\u000aTransmission: 10-speed automatic\u000a\u000aMPG: 19 city/28 hwy\u000a\u000aGary Gastelu is FoxNews.com's Automotive Editor.

aVCar designers have every kind of software and virtual reality tool. But when they want to make sure a car's curves look just right, they rely on one of the world's oldest materials: clay.\u000a\u000aEvery vehicle by every major carmaker, from Mercedes to Tesla to Toyota, is formed in clay long before it ever hits the road. Automakers hire sculptors to make scale models and full-size clay vehicles. They sculpt every detail, from windows to door handles to slight creases in the hood. They sculpt interiors, too, in such fine detail that focus groups can't always tell they're looking at a clay dashboard.\u000a\u000aCar companies have tried other materials, like plaster. They've tried designing cars on computers. But without the hand-sculpting process, designs tend to look stiff and stale, said Bob Boniface, the design director for global Buick exteriors at General Motors Co.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"Clay is still the best. It's a very flexible medium," Boniface said. "We can put the clay on and take it off very quickly."\u000a\u000aClay has been used in car design studios since at least the 1930s. Legendary GM designer Harley Earl is thought to be one of its pioneers. Now, in the same light-filled studios Earl once used, GM designers and sculptors still use thousands of pounds of reddish-brown clay each year from Kolb, a German supplier.\u000a\u000aDesign is more critical than ever to car companies, Boniface said. Brands are now basically equal when it comes to crash performance, fuel economy, road feel and price. Design is the great differentiator.\u000a\u000a"A car is a product, yes, but it's a very emotional purchase," he said. "So the work we do here in design is very, very important in terms of distinguishing our product from the rest of the competitive landscape."\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aCar design begins with designers' sketches. Once the designers have narrowed down some ideas, sculptors make one-third-scale clay models of their drawings. One design is eventually chosen to pursue.\u000a\u000aA full-scale clay model is the next step. At Buick, sculptors make a skeleton from foam, plywood and aluminum, and then cover it with 2 to 3 inches of warm clay, which is heated in special ovens for 24 hours before it's used.\u000a\u000aWhen the clay cools, it's ready for sculpting. Car companies use milling machines to carve out the rough shape of the vehicle, a process that takes about two days. Then sculptors do the detail work, shaping the subtle arches around the wheels or the jeweled patterns in the headlights.\u000a\u000aGianna Ball, a Buick exterior sculptor, was trained in metalsmithing and worked in a high-end car restoration shop before completing a two-year diploma program in clay modeling at Detroit's College for Creative Studies. She likes the challenge of sculpting the intricate details in the vehicle's front and rear.\u000a\u000aClay is the perfect substance to work with, she said, because it's so forgiving.\u000a\u000a"You can take a chance and make a design move that might work, might not work, and it's easily fixed or changed," she said.\u000a\u000aSculptors work closely with designers, who might suggest changing an angle or moving a crease upward by a millimeter. They also work closely with digital sculptors, who can scan the clay model and send that data to engineers. Engineers might send back changes to ensure the design meets crash-test standards.\u000a\u000aFor the last year, digital sculptor Courtney Urbiel has been working on the design of a door. Clay makes the work much faster, she said. If a corner is too sharp and might hit a passenger's elbow, a clay sculptor can soften it in a matter of minutes. Making that change digitally would take hours, Urbiel said.\u000a\u000aThe final design of a vehicle might be changed 12 or more times. One critical test comes when the clay model is covered in a film that looks like paint and is taken outside to see how the natural light plays on its curves.\u000a\u000a"Sometimes you take it outside and it looks horrible," Boniface said. "But the car ultimately is going to be living in the wild."\u000a\u000aIt takes three or four years from the first sketch to a car rolling off the line. On a recent day in Buick's studio, a clay model of a new, 2018 Buick Enclave was partially hidden because sculptors were already working on style changes for a future Enclave.\u000a\u000aDesigner Max Sullivan eyed the side of the model and stretched a long piece of tape over a section he wanted Ball to re-sculpt. The human touch, he said, has always been part of the process of making art. Designing cars is no different.\u000a\u000a"You have to be able to mold it and shape it as it is, in front of you," he said. "If you go into the computer, it's just not real."

aVKFC has cast another unexpected celebrity to portray American food icon and brand founder Colonel Harland Sanders: Ray Liotta. The actor is best known for his 1990 role as Henry Hill in Goodfellas and is currently the star of NBC\u2019s TV series Shades of Blue, a police drama also featuring Jennifer Lopez. Liotta will replace Rob Lowe, who was elected in April.\u000a\u000aMillennials might know the Colonel as a smiley caricature plastered on every bucket of \u201cfinger licking good\u201d chicken. But for those who don\u2019t know, the white-haired Southern gentleman was actually a real person. He was born in Indiana in 1890 but moved to Kentucky as an adult. He established a restaurant in a North Corbin, Kentucky, service station in 1930, and by 1935 the restaurant had grown so popular that Sanders was made an honorary colonel by Kentucky Governor Ruby Laffoon. Five years later, he finalized a secret recipe that became the basis for a fried-chicken empire.\u000a\u000aSince 2015, the real-life Sanders has been portrayed in commercials by a series of actors. Liotta\u2019s presence in the lineup of Colonels serves as a promotion for KFC\u2019s \u201ctwo authentic Southern flavors,\u201d according to a press release.

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

aVBy AnnaMaria Andriotis and Ezequiel Minaya, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000aCredit-reporting company Equifax Inc. said Thursday that hackers gained access to some of its systems, potentially compromising the personal information of roughly 143 million U.S. consumers in one of the biggest and most threatening data breaches of recent years.

aVAs Equifax consumers attempt to check whether they are among the 143 million individuals whose information has been compromised in a massive cyber-attack, the consumer credit reporting agency has included a clause on its TrustedID portal that could disqualify victims from joining a class-action suit.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aIn response to the hack, Equifax has established a website allowing individuals to check whether their personal information has been impacted. However, by using the portal and joining TrustedID, it appears from the terms of service that people are implicitly agreeing to a clause that bars them from taking part in any class action against the company: \u201cPlease read this entire section carefully because it affects your legal rights by requiring arbitration of disputes (except as set forth below) and a waiver of the ability to bring or participate in a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action. Arbitration provides a quick and cost effective mechanism for resolving disputes, but you should be aware that it also limits your rights to discovery and appeal.\u201d The caveat was first reported by TechCrunch.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, Equifax updated its terms of service allowing consumers to opt out of this arbitration clause, but that requires them to \u201cnotify Equifax in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept this agreement on the site,\u201d according to The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aOne of the attorneys involved with a proposed class-action lawsuit filed on Thursday evening warned customers about using the portal.\u000a\u000a\u201cEquifax has placed a stealth arbitration clause, which waives the victim\u2019s right to sue,\u201d Ben Meiselas, attorney with Geragos & Geragos, told FOX Business on Friday. \u201cBy checking the Equifax site if you are a victim and entering your information binds a consumer to a complex arbitration scheme.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother problem with using the TrustedID program is that it is operated by Equifax, so consumers are once again giving sensitive information to the company.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aEquifax did not return FOX Business\u2019 request for comment at the time of publication.\u000a\u000aGeragos & Geragos along with OlsenDaines filed a proposed class-action suit Thursday evening on behalf of two plaintiffs whose information was stored by Equifax and hacked by an unauthorized third party. The complaint alleges Equifax was negligent in failing to provide adequate technological safeguards to protect consumer information and that it should have spent more to prevent cyber-attacks, but chose not to.\u000a\u000aMeiselas said the class-action suit against Equifax could be one of the largest \u201cin U.S. history.\u201d The firm is seeking up to $70 billion in damages as a result of two years\u2019 worth of identity theft for victims, Meiselas told FOX Business. He also voiced concerns about the three executives who sold stock after the company became aware of the breach on July 29, but before it was disclosed publicly on Thursday.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aSenator James Lankford (R-OK) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about President Trump making a deal with democrats, why he disagrees with President Trump that the republicans should completely end the filibuster in the senate and shoots down the rumor that there is GOP conspiracy to undue the 2016 presidential election.\u000a\u000aListen here:\u000a\u000aSenator Lankford on President Trump's deal with democrats on the debt limit not being good for the republican agenda.\u000a\u000a(Lankford) The issue that we really face is anytime you do debt limit it's a very basic principle the debt limit exists so that the nation has to stop and debate debt and try to figure it out. This was just a way to be able to advance the dead limit in to ignore the debt rather as actually try to resolve the debt and just be able to move it and we loaded even more into December so it's now debt limits its flood insurance, it's all of our appropriation bills. All those are loaded all into one a big package now in December and making a cliff even higher.\u000a\u000aSenator Lankford on President Trump wanting the Senate to end the filibuster\u000a\u000a(Lankford) I've actually been out there on this for two years. I laid out a proposal two years ago when we did not know who would run the senate so we're talking prior to the twenty sixteen elections at that point no one knew which direction of the Senate was going to go. I made a proposal to everybody and just said here's a simple way to do it lets fix the filibuster by doing this one thing . Most people don't know there's two filibusters for every bill one to get on the bill and another one to get off the bill. I think that's ridiculous you cannot even debate a bill and get on it without sixty votes so i have proposed getting rid of that first filibuster entirely and whoever is in the majority should be able to get on a bill and debate it and once you start debating it everyone gets their voice everyone gets to engage in it they work they actually get it passed. But to have a group that can step back and say no you can't even discuss this topic on the senate floor I think is absurd. so I'm actually a proponent to say there needs to be a moment everybody is made sure that they get heard that's with the filibuster is supposed to do but it's not working as its intended to get rid of the first one entirely let's get on debates actually move on these things.\u000a\u000a(Kilmeade) have you told the President this?\u000a\u000a(Lankford) I actually have. I sat down with the President about a month ago, we talked about the specific idea and he was very very favorable to that and very helpful.\u000a\u000aLankford on President Trump telling DACA recipients that the government is not coming after them and why DACA is just one part of immigration reform\u000a\u000a(Kilmeade) How do you feel about that being an isolated offering without being tied to the wall or any type of comprehensive plan?\u000a\u000a(Lankford) I don't think that's where the President is, to be an isolated offering that is not connected. The President and I have spoken about this I would say the conversation is not to do just individual take care of what's happening with DACA but we've got much larger immigration issues. if we just work on DACA legislatively that will be no different than what President Obama did when he did a DACA statement and then our borders were flooded with people trying to come across the border and to try to get in before " the gates closed." We need to deal with border security, we need to deal with internal security, we need to deal with the e-verify system. What Tom Cotton and David Perdue have put out there is a good proposal to be able to start talking about how do we handle a merit based immigration rather than the just family connected immigration. All these things need to be a part of the conversation. DACA is one section of a larger conversation about immigration and I think we should handle it that way. I've had several folks say we can solve this in a week and I've said no we're not going to solve this a week ,this will be months of debate because it should be about reforming the immigration and how we do it, not just dealing with DACA.\u000a\u000aLankford on Steve Bannon saying republicans do not want to implement President Trump's populist agenda\u000a\u000a(Kilmeade) What are your thoughts on Bannon's theory?\u000a\u000a(Lankford) Hmm. That's an interesting proposal the accountability side of it I would say republicans at this point often are saying hey we're on the same team we may disagree on 5 or 10% of the issues but we agree on 90-95% of the issues and many republicans feel like they are getting the heat from the white house and democrats who disagree with us 90% of the time are getting off scot free. So we are allies with the President on most of the policies but not all of us think alike on every issue, that's just the uniqueness. I represent Oklahoma , we as Oklahomans don't agree with every issue with every person in every other state is the reason we have a diverse perspective but let's try to find the ways to be able to work together, if we disagree, let's talk it out.\u000a\u000aSenator Lankford on where're there is a GOP conspiracy to undo the 2016 election\u000a\u000a(Kilmeade) So there is no GOP conspiracy to undo the 2016 election?\u000a\u000a(Lankford) No, there's not a GOP conspiracy to undo it. Obviously Ben Sasse doesn't agree with the President on a lot of areas and such. There are going to be individuals that are in there but there's no grand conspiracy to undo the election, quite frankly the focus is we always are guaranteed only four years of the presidency so let's get as much done as we can and hope we have eight.

aVA Las Vegas man is suing Whole Foods after breaking his teeth on rocks inside a rotisserie chicken. TMZ reports that Dr. Albert Liu broke two teeth on stones found in a ready-to-eat Organic Naked Rotisserie Chicken purchased from the Texas-based grocer.\u000a\u000aLiu claims that he contacted Whole Foods to file a report and that the manager said they should never have sold him the chicken. But apparently, it\u2019s quite normal for fowl to eat rocks. In multiple forums across the web, concerned poultry parents inquire about the safety of their pebble-eating birds. Bagus Adiwiluhung, a doctoral student at Aalto University in Finland, says it\u2019s necessary to help them digest food, considering their mouths bear no teeth. He quotes author John Hudson Tiner, who wrote, \u201cA bird swallows small bits of gravel that act as 'teeth' in the gizzard, breaking down hard food such as seeds and thus helping digestion."\u000a\u000aMost state laws say that if someone finds a foreign object in their food, they can sue. But if it\u2019s something considered \u201creasonably expected upon consumption\u201d \u2014 like fish bones or cherry pits \u2014 then you probably won\u2019t win. Glass, metal, and plastic are obviously lawsuit-worthy, but since it\u2019s common practice for chickens to eat pebbles, it\u2019s unclear whether or not Liu\u2019s teeth-breaking rocks will be considered foreign.\u000a\u000aThe Daily Meal has reached out to Whole Foods for comment.

aVWhen Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, America was deeply in debt, with its economy and dignity under attack. Pirates from North Africa\u2019s Barbary Coast routinely captured American merchant ships and held the sailors as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute payments far beyond what the new country could afford.\u000a\u000aFor fifteen years, America had tried to work with the four Muslim powers (Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco) driving the piracy, but negotiation proved impossible.

aVThe number of international travelers to the U.S. has dramatically declined in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, according to a revised report by the U.S. Travel Association.\u000a\u000aThe Travel Trends Index, released Tuesday, shows a sharper decrease in international visitation than was originally estimated after evaluating newly available data. To compile its data, the report tracks flight and hotel bookings, plane boardings and other data.\u000a\u000aThe previous report from early July claimed there had been 13 straight months of year-over-year growth.

aVFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is encouraging her supporters to \u201cfight with everything\u201d they've got to defend the Obama-era program that stops illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. at a young age from being deported.\u000a\u000aBut just a few years ago, in an interview that has resurfaced online, Clinton called for sending back illegal immigrant children who crossed the border to \u201csend a clear message\u201d that such crossings won\u2019t be tolerated by the United States.\u000a\u000aThat interview, conducted in June 2014 on CNN, has been shared online by critics as Clinton protests President Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay,\u201d Clinton said at the time. \u201cSo, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.\u201d\u000a\u000aClinton, though, was not speaking about DACA recipients -- rather, she was referring to the surge of illegal immigrant children crossing the border from Central America.\u000a\u000aClinton argued the children should be reunited with their families.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey should be sent back,\u201d Clinton said.\u000a\u000aDACA recipients, often referred to as "Dreamers," generally have a longer-term connection to the U.S., having lived in the country for years and obtained work permits under the program.\u000a\u000aTrump announced earlier this week that the program, established in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama, would be ended after six months.\u000a\u000aPRESIDENT TRUMP'S STATEMENT ON DACA\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration argues Obama didn\u2019t have the authority to enact the policy and says Congress should take up the issue.\u000a\u000aDemocrats, including Clinton, have expressed worries that the move will lead to the deportation of those who came out of the shadows to obtain DACA status.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNo time to waste - we've got to fight with everything we've got to #DefendDACA,\u201d Clinton said this week.

And while we\u2019re on the subject, our editors think you should delete that whole business about Trump breathing down your neck. It is simply not true. We looked at the debate tape.

aVAlready devastated by Hurricane Irma, Caribbean islands are now bracing for the back-end of a deadly double-whammy, as powerful Hurricane Jose prepares to make landfall.\u000a\u000aThe unrelenting pummeling of the Caribbean was set to continue this weekend as Category 4 Jose followed a similar path to Irma, the National Hurricane Center said. According to the NHC's 11 a.m. advisory, Jose was roughly 415 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands -- which Irma already hit earlier this week -- barreling in at 18 mph with 150 mph sustained winds.\u000a\u000aAntigua and Barbuda were alerted of possible \u201clife-threatening flooding" due to Jose.\u000a\u000aHurricane watches were in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Sint Maarten, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy. Those islands had already counted 12 of the 23 deaths related to Irma.\u000a\u000aMeantime, Hurricane Katia was threatening to make landfall early Saturday in the state of Veracruz in Mexico.\u000a\u000aKatia, classified as strong Category 2 hurricane and edging toward Category 3 status, has sustained winds of 100 mph, according to a Friday morning advisory.

aVBy MEGAN MCARDLE | Bloomberg View\u000a\u000aJames Damore, the author of the notorious Google memo, has had his 15 minutes of fame. In six months, few of us will be able to remember his name. But Google will remember \u2014 not the company, but the search engine. For the rest of his life, every time he meets someone new or applies for a job, the first thing they will learn about him, and probably the only thing, is that he wrote a document that caused an internet uproar.\u000a\u000aThe internet did not invent the public relations disaster, or the summary firing to make said disaster go away. What the internet changed is the scale of the disasters, and the number of people who are vulnerable to them, and the cold implacable permanence of the wreckage they leave behind.\u000a\u000aTry to imagine the Damore story happening 20 years ago. It\u2019s nearly impossible, isn\u2019t it? Take a company of similar scope and power to Google \u2014 Microsoft, say. Would any reporter in 1997 have cared that some Microsoft engineer she\u2019d never heard of had written a memo his co-workers considered sexist? Probably not. It was more likely a problem for Microsoft HR, or just angry water-cooler conversations.\u000a\u000aEven if the reporter had cared, what editor would have run the story? On an executive, absolutely \u2014 but a random engineer who had no power over corporate policy? No one would have wasted precious, expensive column inches reporting it. And if for some reason they had, no other papers would have picked it up. Maybe the engineer would have been fired, maybe not, but he\u2019d have gotten another job, having probably learned to be a little more careful about what he said to co-workers.\u000a\u000aCompare to what has happened in this internet era: The memo became public, and the internet erupted against the author, quite publicly executing his economic and social prospects. I doubt Damore will ever again be employable at anything resembling his old salary and status. (Unless maybe a supporter hires him to make a political statement.)

aV\u000a\u000aBy Samuel Chamberlain, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aForty-seven prominent conservatives have signed an open letter warning the mainstream media against using data on hate groups compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\u000a\u000aThe letter calls the SPLC a "discredited, left-wing political activist organization that seeks to silence its political opponents with a 'hate group' label of its own invention."\u000a\u000aFounded in 1971, the SPLC gained fame by successfully prosecuting legal cases against white supremacist organizations, including the Ku Klux Klan. It describes its mission as "fighting hate and bigotry and ... seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of our society."\u000a\u000aToday, the SPLC is best known for tracking hate groups, which the organization defines as having "beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristic." Currently, the SPLC says 917 hate groups are operating in the United States.\u000a\u000aSPLC's "hate map" gained prominence in the media after last month's deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. However, critics say the organization has falsely slapped the "hate group" label on non-violent groups who hold traditional beliefs about hot-button issues such as gay marriage and abortion.\u000a\u000aLast month, a prominent evangelical ministry based in Florida filed a federal lawsuit accusing the SPLC of defamation after it was labeled an "active hate group." In July, Fox News found that at least seven organizations are listed as hate groups by the SPLC despite explicitly prohibiting violence by their members.

aVIn Extreme Ownership, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin share hard-hitting, Navy SEAL combat stories that translate into lessons for business and life. With riveting first-hand accounts of making high-pressure decisions as Navy SEAL battlefield leaders, this book is equally gripping for leaders who seek to dominate other arenas. Jocko and Leif served together in SEAL Task Unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated Special Operations unit from the war in Iraq. Their efforts contributed to the historic triumph for U.S. forces in Ramadi. Through those difficult months of sustained combat, Jocko, Leif and their SEAL brothers learned that leadership--at every level--is the most important thing on the battlefield. They started Echelon Front to teach these same leadership principles to companies across industries throughout the business world that want to build their own high-performance, winning teams.\u000a\u000aThis book explains the SEAL leadership concepts crucial to accomplishing the most difficult missions in combat and how to apply them to any group, team, or organization. It provides the reader with Jocko and Leif's formula for success: the mindset and guiding principles that enable SEAL combat units to achieve extraordinary results. It demonstrates how to apply these directly to business and life to likewise achieve victory.

aVPresident Trump tore into congressional Republicans Friday for their failure to pass big legislation, effectively firing back at critics griping about his dealings this week with Democratic leaders.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepublicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen! Even worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will \u2026 never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!\u201d he tweeted.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Trump tried to light a fire under GOP lawmakers to get to work on his next big agenda time: Tax reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepublicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!\u201d he tweeted.\u000a\u000aThe president stunned GOP leadership on Wednesday by agreeing to demands by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to attach a short-term debt-ceiling and spending measure to Hurricane Harvey relief funds. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and others had wanted a longer-term debt deal, but were overruled by the president.\u000a\u000aThe president followed that up by reportedly discussing the prospect with Schumer and Pelosi of scrapping the debt ceiling entirely \u2013 to boot, he tweeted assurances to so-called \u201cdreamers\u201d on Thursday at Pelosi\u2019s request.\u000a\u000aRYAN WON'T BACK SCRAPPING DEBT CEILING\u000a\u000aRyan, who dined Thursday with Trump, later dismissed reports that he was furious at the president. But, speaking with Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum,\u201d he said he would oppose any deal to eliminate the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000a"As imperfect as this tool is, I always see this as a good tool for fiscal discipline," Ryan said. "I like the fact that Congress controls the power of the purse and that gives us opportunities for fiscal discipline."\u000a\u000aYet Trump\u2019s discussions with Democrats reflect a growing frustration with Capitol Hill Republicans, who repeatedly have been unable to pass legislation to roll back the Affordable Care Act \u2013 as referenced in Friday\u2019s tweet.\u000a\u000aFurther, Trump for months has prodded Republicans to lower the 60-vote standard needed to pass controversial legislation to a simple 51-vote majority. This is the \u201cFilibuster Rule\u201d he mentioned on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., though, has long been resistant to changing those rules \u2013 perhaps concerned it could come back to hurt the party whenever the GOP is in the minority. Further, the last ObamaCare overhaul bill was not subject to the 60-vote standard and failed anyway.\u000a\u000aBut Trump has been struggling to pass elements of his agenda through the GOP-controlled Congress. A source told Fox News that in striking the short-term debt-ceiling deal, Trump wanted to clear the decks so he could get Congress to focus on tax reform \u2013 his big legislative agenda item this fall, which he touted during a speech late Wednesday in North Dakota.\u000a\u000aTrump also tweeted a warning Friday to residents in the path of Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000a\u201cHurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen.

aVFor more than half a century, football helmets have done a great job of preventing skull fractures, but they\u2019ve been ineffective when it came to preventing concussions and protecting the brain. They just weren\u2019t meant to do that.\u000a\u000aBut now there\u2019s a new helmet that\u2019s been designed to protect not only the skull, but what\u2019s inside it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Zero1 and it\u2019s ranked No. 1 on the NFL/NFLPA 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results. VICIS, the Seattle-based sports equipment company that makes the Zero1, says 25 of the NFL's 32 teams bought the helmets before spring practice, and the company hopes many NFL players \u2014 and players on at least 20 NCAA teams \u2014 will be wearing them during the upcoming season.\u000a\u000aDoug Baldwin, a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who is working with VICIS, said participation in football nationwide has diminished because of fear of concussions and their link to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) \u2014 but the Zero1 helmet should change all that.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a"We take significant hits on the football field. Football is a violent collision sport," Baldwin said. "A product like this can give you that confidence of safety. It can boost your performance. I think it's going to save the game."\u000a\u000aDave Marver, VICIS\u2019 co-founder and CEO, said the Zero1 has four protective layers that "are designed to work together to provide outstanding fit and mitigate impact forces or slow them before they can reach the head and brain \u2026 better than any helmet ever made":\u000a\u000aThe outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, yielding when it's hit and slowing impact forces.\u000a\u000aRight below that is a second, reflex layer of columns that "bend and eventually buckle upon impact."\u000a\u000aThe third layer is a very thin hard shell that protects against skull fractures.\u000a\u000aThe fourth, innermost layer is the form liner, which conforms to the player's head.\u000a\u000aMarver said traditional helmets have a hard outer shell that makes a \u201ccrack\u201d sound on impact. The Zero1, on the other hand, goes \u201cthump.\u201d\u000a\u000a"The sound of the game is going to change,\u201d Marver said. \u201cIt means that players are going to be better protected."\u000a\u000aDr. Sam Browd, a pediatric neurosurgeon and co-founder of VICIS, said no helmet will fully eliminate concussions from football. But he said the Zero1 should prove very effective in reducing them.\u000a\u000aBrowd teamed up with Marver and VICIS\u2019 chief technology officer, Per Reinhall, to create the Zero1 because he had treated many teenagers who had to quit football because of repetitive head injuries.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000a"This was sad,\u201d Marver said. \u201cSo Sam wanted to do something about that, and he brought Per and me together and we started the company."\u000a\u000aA Zero1 helmet costs $1,500, much more than others, "because it's a more sophisticated design," Marver said. Besides the potential to reduce concussions, the helmet provides better peripheral vision, so players can see more of the field and opponents coming at them.\u000a\u000aReinhall said VICIS\u2019 technicians "torture the helmet" extensively, using a linear ram machine and a pendulum that hits the helmet at different speeds to judge its performance in the company's "smash lab."\u000a\u000aBrowd said a lot of players who have test-driven the helmet, linemen in particular, have said they "don't feel the impact as much" when they are tackled.\u000a\u000a"It's really encouraging," he said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aAdded Baldwin: "There's a lot of concerns out there amongst parents and adults about their children being safe on the football field. We [have] introduced a piece of equipment that is going to make the game safer, make their youth safer, prolong their careers in the NFL, in high school or college or wherever it may be.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you have something sustainable \u2026 that's going to bring back the attention to the fun of the sport, and not necessarily the risks of the sport. It's going to help prevent injuries."

aVThe massive Equifax data breach, which could affect up to 143 million consumers in the U.S., has thrust data privacy into the spotlight once again.\u000a\u000aEquifax confirmed the \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d Thursday, noting that criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files. The information accessed primarily includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver's license numbers, according to the credit reporting company.\u000a\u000aCredit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers were also accessed in the attack.\u000a\u000aVERIZON DATA BREACH: 14 MILLION CUSTOMERS REPORTEDLY EXPOSED\u000a\u000a"This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes," said Equifax CEO Richard F. Smith, in a statement.\u000a\u000aSecurity experts say that the full impact of the breach may not become apparent for some time. \u201cAt this stage it's difficult to determine the severity of the breach, but the scale is significant," explained Leigh-Anne Galloway, cyber security resilience lead at security specialist Positive Technologies, in a email to Fox News. \u201cAttackers could potentially target high-value individuals with good credit ratings to borrow money fraudulently, or use that as a basis to assess the value of the stored card data.\u201d\u000a\u000aSecurity expert Graham Cluley also highlighted the seriousness of the breach, pointing to the sensitive information accessed. \u201cThis is why it's so serious when companies lose your personal identifiable information,\u201d he wrote, in a blog post. \u201cA password you can change, your personal details are probably going to always be the same - whether you like it or not.\u201d\u000a\u000aUS, EUROPEAN ENERGY FIRMS TARGETED BY SHADOWY CYBER ESPIONAGE GROUP, EXPERTS WARN\u000a\u000aEquifax has set up a dedicated website to help consumers find out if their information has been impacted by the breach and to sign up for credit file monitoring and identity theft protection. Consumers, however, have to provide Equifax with their last name and the last six digits of their social security number to use the service.\u000a\u000aBill Mann, chief product officer at identity management specialist Centrify, noted that Equifax shares dipped 5 percent when news of the breach emerged. \u201cThe long-term impact will likely be greater, as this breach impacts millions of consumers who trust Equifax with their most personal information, and trust is at the core of their business,\u201d he said, in a statement emailed to Fox News. \u201cBased on its severity and the sheer numbers involved, a breach like this will displace consumer trust, and potentially wipe out additional value quickly.\u201d\u000a\u000aEquifax shares were down more than 15 percent in early trading Friday.\u000a\u000aRUSSIAN CYBERSECURITY FIRM KASPERSKY LAB A 'DANGER' TO US SECURITY, SENATOR WARNS\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will take months or years for Equifax to recover \u2013 from both the impact on its stock and on consumers\u2019 trust \u2013 and no doubt they\u2019ll be learning from this for years,\u201d added Ray Rothrock, CEO and Chairman of cybersecurity analytics specialist RedSeal, in a statement emailed to Fox News.\u000a\u000aEquifax said Thursday that three executives at the firm who sold stock just after the discovery of the data breach were not aware of the incident at the time of the sale. The trio sold $1.8 million in stock, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the findings.\u000a\u000aThe Equifax incident is the latest in a string of high-profile data breaches.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aKarl Rove, Former Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush joined Brian Kilmeade at KLBJ in Austin TX to discuss the ramifications of President Trump making a deal with democrats and the ramifications for the Republican Party. Rove said it is important to be above partisanship and people shouldn't kid themselves that this is going to lead to increased support for the President from democrats, especially after the 2018 midterm elections. Rove added that while the deal with democrats may turn out to be a good one, the President should not have surprised his own party because the worst thing he can do is surprise his allies. On tax reform, Rove agrees with the approach of the House Freedom Caucus on tax reform but warns that if they don't get what they want they would vote with Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aListen here:\u000a\u000aKarl Rove on the House Freedom Caucus voting with Nancy Pelosi if they don't feel the GOP tax reform plan is perfect enough\u000a\u000a(Rove) The Freedom Caucus has been saying let's do everything in regular order which I agree with have the committees do their work don't have this stuff sort of drop down from the top but they have been talking in the last couple of days about it coming up with their own tax reform plan but we've had the Ways and Means committee spend the last year and a half under Brady with Freedom Caucus members on the Ways & Means committee working out the plan that's the way it ought to do it. Here at the end, the Freedom Caucus pops up and says well we've got a better idea and you do it our way or it's the highway because these guys would rather vote with Nancy Pelosi if they think that the republican plan isn't perfect enough, by god they're capable of voting with the Nancy Pelosi and vote which they've done several times thus far and threatened to do even more.\u000a\u000aKarl Rove on President Trump's deal with democrats\u000a\u000a(Rove) I got to tell you, this was a deal that the democrats wanted because it gives them more leverage over both the budget and over the debt ceiling . Count on it, they're going to be coming at the end of the year with a huge immigration bill it's not going to be just DACA, it's going to be a whole bunch of other things and on spending at the end of the year when we come back to another continuing resolution they're going to say well you know what, we want to plus up some things we don't want you to have that more defense spending and we want more social spending and will give you another deal like we just gave you. So let's not get ourselves, yesterday could be the beginning of something good but it's going to require the president to be focused and look, no more surprises, the worst thing the president could do is surprise your allies. It's one thing to say look we're going to do something, I want to do something that you don't like and we did that we would say to the republicans we want to do something you don't like we want to get the issue of campaign finance reform off the books we don't like the bill but we got to get it done don't but we're not going to surprise you yesterday they got surprised and there are lots of people running around today in the halls of congress and god dang it why were we surprised.\u000a\u000a(Kilmeade) Right and they're mad at their leadership too\u000a\u000a(Rove) Oh yeah and they're going to blame Ryan for what Trump did to them, which is one of the great ironies.

Dianne Feinstein has dominated California politics for more than a quarter of a century. But facing blistering criticism that she\u2019s out of touch with the progressive left following her recent comments about President Donald Trump and DACA, it\u2019s increasingly looking like the Democratic lawmaker will face a major primary challenge if she runs for a fifth full term.\u000a\u000aFeinstein, the oldest member of the Senate, has been the target of sustained liberal criticism since January. Her centrist brand of politics, skeptical view of single-payer health care and support for some of the president\u2019s earliest nominees have drawn the ire of progressives who have little tolerance for Feinstein\u2019s pragmatic approach in the Trump era.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt times, the senator has been highly critical of Trump. But her recent suggestion that, given time, Trump \u201ccan be a good president\u201d \u2014 and her concession Tuesday that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program might be on shaky legal ground \u2014 have emboldened her critics and turned a spotlight on her reelection plans.\u000a\u000aBuzz in state political circles increasingly centers on one prospective Democratic challenger, Kevin de León of Los Angeles, the first Latino to hold the powerful position of state Senate president pro tempore in more than 120 years.\u000a\u000aDe León, the son of immigrants \u2014 his father was Chinese and Guatemalan, his mother Guatemalan \u2014 has joined forces with billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer to become a leading advocate on the issue of climate change.

Just don't ask them to define it, because you'll get the same answer.\u000a\u000aLast year, a poll was released showing 53 percent of Americans under age 35 are dissatisfied with our nation\u2019s current economic system and think socialism would be good for the country.\u000a\u000aThe same poll found that 45 percent of young Americans would be willing to support an openly socialist Presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aThe findings of this poll coincide with the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, an avowed \u201cDemocratic Socialist\u201d from Vermont who received millions of votes in the 2016 Democratic Primary, many of them from millennials.\u000a\u000aWhile it\u2019s clear that young people increasingly view socialism in a positive light, it\u2019s also clear that many of them are uneducated about what it entails, or the impact it\u2019s had throughout history.\u000a\u000aThe same poll found many millennials are unfamiliar with historical figures often associated with socialism, such as Che Guevara, Joseph Stalin, and Karl Marx.\u000a\u000aWanting to see what millennials in D.C. thought of socialism, Campus Reform headed to Washington, D.C. to ask students two simple questions: \u201cDo you like socialism?\u201d and \u201cWhat is socialism?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt quickly became clear that while most of the people we spoke with held an idyllic view of socialism, most had little idea of what it actually is.

aVOutraged home renters in Florida are complaining after their landlord prohibited them from boarding up windows in preparation for Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aIn a letter to renters in Colony Park, West Palm Beach, management barred anyone from boarding windows despite the threat of Hurricane Irma making landfall this weekend, WPTV reported.\u000a\u000a"Understand that while we empathize with your need to protect your personal property, boarding up your residence is NOT something you are allowed to do," the letter reads.\u000a\u000aThe letter provides no explanation for the policy, but it advises the renters to move their personal property as far inside their homes as possible, away from doors and windows.\u000a\u000aStorm and hurricane warnings have been issued for South Florida as Irma nears the state.\u000a\u000a"People here are very scared," Del Vargas, a resident who received the letter, told WPTV. She claims her lease makes her responsible for looking after the property and preparing for storms, yet management won't let her board up.\u000a\u000aShe said each house has shutters locked away in closets under the stairwells.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrevious years we\u2019ve had property managers that have allowed the maintenance men to open up the doors and the tenants would go in and get the shutters that are underneath the steps over here and they supplied the bolts," she said.\u000a\u000aBut this year, she said, the management said no.\u000a\u000a"When I asked her today, she said, 'Corporate said no, no shutters.' I\u2019m like, 'Wait a second, the governor said make a plan, get it done," she added.\u000a\u000aOther renters said they will ignore the requests by the management and will use the locked shutters. \u201cIt\u2019s humans, people living here," Genesis Aldorado said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy child and her child and everybody\u2019s child are more important than the rules of this community," Brittany Duarete said.

Trump has been increasingly frustrated with McConnell and Ryan for failing to pass much of anything since he took office. So he struck a deal with Schumer and Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThe move underscores what I\u2019ve always maintained about Donald Trump, that he\u2019s basically an independent president.

aVJournalist and baseball lover Ed Henry reveals for the first time the backstory of faith that guided Jackie Robinson into not only the baseball record books but the annals of civil rights advancement as well. Through recently discovered sermons, interviews with Robinson\u2019s family and friends, and even an unpublished book by the player himself, Henry details a side of Jackie\u2019s humanity that few have taken the time to see.\u000a\u000aBranch Rickey, the famed owner who risked it all by signing Jackie to his first contract, is also shown as a complex individual who wanted nothing more than to make his God-fearing mother proud of him. Few know the level at which Rickey struggled with his decision, only moving forward after a private meeting with a minister he\u2019d just met. It turns out Rickey was not as certain about signing Robinson as historians have always assumed.\u000a\u000aWith many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized.\u000a\u000aThis book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson\u2019s already awe-inspiring legacy. Yes, Jackie and Branch are both still heroes long after their deaths. Now, we learn more fully than ever before, there was an assist from God too.

The complaint alleges Equifax was negligent in failing to provide adequate technological safeguards to protect consumer information and that it should have spent more to prevent cyber-attacks, but chose not to.\u000a\u000aOne of the attorneys with Geragos & Geragos said on Twitter the lawsuit could be the largest \u201cclass action in US history.\u201d The same attorney told FOX Business his firm would seek as much as $70 billion in damages on behalf of consumers across the nation.\u000a\u000aEquifax did not return FOX Business\u2019 request for comment at the time of publication.\u000a\u000aThe Atlanta-based credit reporting firm announced on Thursday hackers accessed customer accounts between May and July, including Social Security and driver\u2019s license numbers, as well as other sensitive information. The company said it knew about the breach on July 29. Three Equifax executives sold hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock between August 1 and August 2, but a spokesman for the company said the executives were not aware of the hack at the time.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the stock was down more than 15% and on pace for its biggest decline since 1999.

aVThe Google Pixel 2 could come with a feature that might disappoint many awaiting its big arrival.\u000a\u000aGoogle is planning to bundle the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor in the upcoming Google Pixel 2 line, Android Police and XDA Developers are reporting, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the company's plans. The feature will put the Google Pixel 2's power about in line with some of its top competitors, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, the Essential Phone, and the LG V30.\u000a\u000aWhile that might sound like a good thing at first, the fact that Google might have opted for the chip might actually be a disappointment.\u000a\u000aLast month, a report from serial leaker Evan Blass suggested Google was actually planning the Qualcomm Snapdragon 836 for its Pixel 2 smartphone line. The smartphones would be the first to come with the feature and could have made the Google Pixel 2 the most powerful Android handset on the market.\u000a\u000aMore: Google Pixel 2 Rumors: Release Date, Specs and More\u000a\u000aAlthough it might sound like the latest news is one word against another, The Verge also pointed out that a recently discovered FCC filing for the Pixel 2 points to at least one version of the smartphone shipping with the Snapdragon 835.\u000a\u000aBut there might still be a glimmer of hope. Blass said on his Twitter page Tuesday night (Sept. 5) that his source, who "has proven accurate time after time," is still saying that the smartphone would ship with the Snapdragon 836. So at this point, he says, he has no reason to believe anything else.\u000a\u000aStill, a processor choice won't make or break the Google Pixel 2. After all, the Snapdragon 835 is still a solid processor.\u000a\u000aAnd aside from the built-in chip, the Pixel 2 should come with a host of appealing features, including a big display that might cover its face, as well as Android Oreo on the software side. The Google Pixel 2 is also expected to ship with a new and improved camera to take on some of the competitors that have tried to stake claim to offering the very best.\u000a\u000aGoogle is expected to unveil its Pixel 2 smartphone at some point in early October.

aVBy Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJ. Edgar Hoover\u2019s abuse of power as FBI director led Congress and the Justice Department to put new checks on that most powerful and secretive of offices. By the time Congress finishes investigating James Comey\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, those safeguards may be due for an update.\u000a\u000aPowerful as Hoover was, even he never simultaneously investigated both major-party candidates for the presidency. Mr. Comey did, and Americans are now getting a glimpse of how much he influenced political events.\u000a\u000aMr. Comey\u2019s actions in the Hillary Clinton email probe are concerning enough. He made himself investigator, judge and jury, breaking the Justice Department\u2019s chain of command. He publicly confirmed the investigation, violating the department\u2019s principles. He announced he would not recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, even as he publicly excoriated her\u2014an extraordinary abuse of his megaphone. Then he rekindled the case only 11 days before the election.\u000a\u000aAn inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee has now shown that Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation was a charade. He wrote a draft statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton in May, long before he bothered to interview her or her staff. This at least finally explains the probe\u2019s lackluster nature: the absence of a grand jury, the failure to follow up on likely perjury, the unorthodox immunity deals made with Clinton aides.\u000a\u000aBut the big development this week is a new look at how Mr. Comey may have similarly juked the probe into Donald Trump\u2019s purported ties to Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation took a sharp and notable turn on Tuesday, as news broke that it had subpoenaed the FBI and the Justice Department for information relating to the infamous Trump \u201cdossier.\u201d That dossier, whose allegations appear to have been fabricated, was commissioned by the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and then developed by a former British spook named Christopher Steele.

According to a Google Translate version of an El Universal story, the lights are a naturally occurring electro-magnetic charge, caused by the collapse of the rocks in the ground during the earthquake.\u000a\u000aIn 2001, NASA scientist Friedmann Freud discovered that "if the stress level (between the rocks) is high, there are electronic loads that momentarily transform insulation rock into a semiconductor."

Inherited from parents who each carry a recessive gene, it has no cure, but a breakthrough treatment is giving the Bowmans hope.\u000a\u000aDoctors are giving Ely a drug newly approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Brineura. It acts as a replacement for an essential enzyme his body does not produce: TPP1.\u000a\u000a"Imagine this enzyme is a little Pac-Man that's going into the nerve cells and eating up the junk that's building up inside neurons," the hospital's Dr. Raymond Wang said. "Because he can't make it himself, he is now getting every two weeks an infusion ... into his brain."\u000a\u000aFDA APPROVAL OF FIRST-EVER BATTEN TREATMENT 'BITTERSWEET' FOR FAMILY BATTLING DISEASE\u000a\u000aWhile not a cure, the treatment aims to delay the effects of Batten disease, which can include speech impairment, blindness, and dementia. Wang hopes in Ely's case, the drug will be a lifeline, postponing any effects until a better treatment, or even a cure, is discovered.\u000a\u000aBekah Bowman believes it is working.\u000a\u000a"Titus at this age was growing fairly clumsy. He was falling a lot and he was having a lot of seizures. Ely, while still clumsy, he's not falling like Titus was. And he is not having any seizures yet," she said.\u000a\u000aThe treatment does not come cheap. Brineura can cost as much as $700,000 a year. While the Bowman's insurance picks up the majority of the costs right now, they will have to re-appeal for approval next year. Family friends started a fundraiser, gofundme.com/team4titus, to help with expenses.\u000a\u000aFAMILY RACING TO RAISE FUNDS FOR DAUGHTER FACING INCURABLE GENETIC DISEASE\u000a\u000aRight now, however, the Bowmans are not focusing on bills; they are savoring their moments with Ely.\u000a\u000a"I see Ely playing ... and I just appreciate it in a whole different way," Bowman said.

aVAt least 23 people have died as Hurricane Irma ravaged the Caribbean this week, destroying buildings and uprooting trees on its potentially catastrophic path toward Florida.\u000a\u000aThe Category 4 storm \u2013 the most potent Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever \u2013 battered the Turks and Caicos Islands early Friday, where waves as high as 20 feet were expected. Communication went down as the storm slammed into the islands. Tourists were evacuated from beachside resorts as the storm barrels toward central Cuba and the Bahamas with Florida in its path.\u000a\u000aIrma has already caused \u201csevere and in places critical\u201d damage to the island of Anguilla, according to the United Kingdom. It also ripped through the islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy and blacked out much of Puerto Rico Thursday.\u000a\u000aWith the hurricane less than 380 miles southeast of Miami, Fla., the first hurricane warnings were issued for parts of southern Florida as the state braced for what could be a catastrophic hit over the weekend.\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center has warned that the hurricane is increasingly likely to slam into Florida this weekend \u2013 as Texas and Louisiana cope with the devastating aftermath caused by Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone in hurricane-prone areas should ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place,\u201d officials said.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s what you should know about Hurricane Irma and its trajectory.\u000a\u000aWhere is Hurricane Irma today?\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma is located about 380 miles southeast of Miami, Fla., Friday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said in a 2 p.m. ET advisory.\u000a\u000aThe storm is headed west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph, according to the latest advisory.\u000a\u000aWhen is it expected to make landfall?\u000a\u000aFlorida Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday that the Florida Keys may feel Irma's effects as early as Friday night.

It brings with it life-threatening winds, storm surges and rainfall, according to the National Hurricane Center.\u000a\u000aThe agency had predicted Irma would stay at Category 4 or 5 as it skirted Cuba on Friday night into Saturday.\u000a\u000aHURRICANE IRMA HAS FLORIDA ZOOS, WILDLIFE PARKS PREPARING FOR CATEGORY 5 STORM\u000a\u000a"This hurricane has the potential to be a major event for the East Coast. It also has the potential to significantly strain FEMA and other governmental resources occurring so quickly on the heels of (Hurricane) Harvey," Evan Myers, chief operating officer of AccuWeather, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aAnd while its impact on the continental U.S. is still uncertain, Florida Gov. Rick Scott already declared a state of emergency Monday in all 67 counties in order to ensure \u201clocal governments have ample time, resources and flexibility to get prepared for this dangerous storm.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Florida, we always prepare for the worst and hope for the best and while the exact path of Irma is not absolutely known at this time, we cannot afford to not be prepared,\u201d Scott said.\u000a\u000aSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Georgia's governor ordered a mandatory evacuation starting on Saturday from the state's Atlantic coast. That includes the city of Savannah.\u000a\u000aDeal's order authorizes about 5,000 Georgia National Guard members to be on active duty to help people respond and recover.\u000a\u000aGeorgia hasn't been hit by a hurricane with winds Category 3 or higher since 1898.\u000a\u000aAlso Thursday, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a statewide emergency declaration and told people to be prepared statewide, although projections suggest the storm could be much weaker by next week.\u000a\u000aCooper said that tropical storms can be very dangerous, and "this storm can impact any part of North Carolina \u2013 all over our state from the mountains to the coast."\u000a\u000aThe last Category 5 storm to hit the United States was Hurricane Andrew in 1992. An estimated 250,000 were left homeless and the storm caused more than $20 billion in damage in the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana. Fifty-five people were killed.\u000a\u000aFox News' Kaitlyn Schallhorn, Zoe Szathmary, Jake Ingrassia and The Associated Press also contributed to this report.

News earlier this year that the case is strictly \u201cabout protecting children who are victims of abuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe sisters claimed, \u201cRevealing juvenile identities under these circumstances is unacceptable and it\u2019s against the law. The media and custodians of public records who let these children down must be held accountable. This case has vast implications for all our children. We hope that by bringing this case to the public\u2019s attention, all children will be reported from reckless reporting.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit, the investigative reports that were conducted in 2006 occurred when the four Duggar girls were underage. They believed those reports would have only been accessible to law enforcement and child service officers. However, they alleged In Touch published as many as eight stories about the family drama.\u000a\u000aThen in June, it was revealed Josh was looking to join his sisters\u2019 lawsuit.

Consolidation would undoubtedly give the false impression that the victim and the perpetrator are \u2018in this together.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe document went on to say, \u201cForcing the victims to join their claims with their perpetrator\u2019s claims would further traumatize the very victims Arkansas law is designed to protect.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe celebrity news site added a judge has yet to make a decision.

Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION SHOW CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE\u000a\u000aOver the past 4 years, Illinois State Police launched a renewed effort to solve the decades- old mystery, including the exhumation of the young woman's body from St. Anthony Catholic Cemetery in Atkinson.\u000a\u000aToday, the Henry County State's Attorney's office named the late Robert Clark as the likely suspect in the cold case. He died in March of 2015 in Bloomington, Indiana.\u000a\u000a"Upon reviewing the thousands of pages of new interviews, the State's Attorney believes the circumstantial evidence is strong enough that it would warrant presentation to a grand jury if Mr. Clark were still alive," said Matt Schutte, Henry Count State's Attorney.\u000a\u000aClark, who would have been 24 years old at the time of the murder, lived alone in an apartment near the Becker's house. He worked with Mary Ann's father Tony at the local coal mines.\u000a\u000aPolice say when Clark was initially interviewed shortly after the crime, he had insisted he was at work that night, and had been busy hauling loads of coal the evening of the murder.\u000a\u000aInvestigators recently discovered "new information contradicting the alibi that Clark was working in the Victoria Coal Mines at the time of the crime."\u000a\u000aThey say Clark's brother revealed that Clark had confided in him that "he was not working at the time of the murder."\u000a\u000aOver the past few years, investigators traveled to five states conducting more than 100 interviews with family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and current and former Atkinson residents.\u000a\u000a"As the investigation progressed, Robert Clark could not be excluded and rose to be the strongest person of interest in the case," according to the news release.\u000a\u000aClark was later convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl in Galva, Illinois. According to the press release, he was sentenced to 6 years in prison but only served two days in the county jail after winning an appeal in a higher court.\u000a\u000aThe news release states the two men investigative team assigned to the cold case in 2013, uncovered new information from witnesses who were either not spoken with during the initial investigation or remained silent out of fear.\u000a\u000a"The two man investigative team located several people connected to Clark over the years and documented a consistent pattern of violent criminal behavior and mental illness spanning Clark's entire adult life. Several people from Clark's past were reluctant to speak about him until after they learned he was deceased. By the late 1980's, Clark had been married and divorced three times. During one of many violent attacks against his second wife, Clark reportedly stated he had killed before and would do it again. Clark threatened to bury her body in the coal mine."\u000a\u000aOn September 29th, 2014, Mary Ann's body was exhumed with the hope of collecting physical evidence for DNA, not available in 1974.\u000a\u000aIt was a long shot, and the results were unsuccessful in developing a full suspect DNA profile, because of deterioration of the victim's body.\u000a\u000aVandemore Funeral homes, owned by Joel Vandemore, stepped in and provided a new casket, private ceremony, and reburial, free of charge.\u000a\u000aIllinois State Police and the Henry County State's Attorney's office are releasing their findings just days before the 43rd anniversary of the murder, hoping someone comes forward with even more information to confirm their belief that Clark is the perpetrator of the crime that shocked the small town of 1,100.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Mary Ann's family is withdrawing their $15,000 reward, "confident" enough the responsible person has been identified.\u000a\u000aAccording to news reports at the time, Mary Ann was a "shy and quiet type of girl", an "A student at Atkinson High School."\u000a\u000aThe unsolved murder was the oldest cold case on the Illinois State Police's Unsolved Crimes web page.

aVWith South Korea predicting North Korea could launch an intercontinental ballistic missile Saturday, a South Korean expert warned \u201chot-tempered and reckless\u201d Kim Jong Un will not cease his beloved missile and nuclear program until he is \u201celiminated.\u201d\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Thursday its neighbor may launch a missile Saturday while celebrating its founding day. The volatile regime is known to put on a show for its citizens during national holidays to display its strength.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that now is the time to strengthen sanctions to the maximum level while securing military deterrence means. Dialogue is ultimately necessary, but now is not the time to talk about dialogue with North Korea,\u201d Lee said.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea reportedly moved an ICBM toward its west coast earlier this week, according to the South Korean paper Asia Business Daily. The rocket was moved overnight, apparently to avoid detection.\u000a\u000aIf the test is conducted, it would be the fourteenth one since February. North Korea has fired 21 missiles this year and Sunday\u2019s nuclear test, where it claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, will be the sixth one in its history.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s push for full nuclear capability may have developed when he was a \u201chot-tempered and reckless\u201d teenager, Nam Sung-wook, a Korea University professor who formerly ran the Institute for National Security Strategy said, according to Yonhap News Agency.\u000a\u000a"The latest development [North Korea's latest sixth nuclear test] is largely attributable to Kim's wild character. If Kim is not eliminated, this issue [the North's provocation] will persist," Nam told South Korean lawmakers.\u000a\u000aNam, part of Seoul\u2019s spy agency between 2008 and 2012, said the dictator had a short temper, recalling a time he \u201cexploded with foul language\u201d because his girlfriend asked him not to smoke.\u000a\u000a"As Kim was smoking at a young age, his girlfriend advised him to quit smoking. Then, Kim exploded with foul language, which was quite shocking [to her]," Nam recalled.\u000a\u000aA previous report by Japanese magazine Nikkei Asian Review also recalled talking to sources commenting on Kim\u2019s anger. The leader reportedly \u201cflew into a rage\u201d when he discovered his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was planning a coup with Chinese officials to have him ousted in 2013.\u000a\u000aJang was executed a short time later.\u000a\u000aNam added: "Any vague fear of Kim is not desirable. Likewise, any simple evaluation of Kim is a no-no."\u000a\u000aExperts fear Kim\u2019s unpredictable rage could drive him to launch a nuclear war as he spews bombastic threats toward neighboring countries and the U.S. Lee also said Thursday that North Korea reaching its nuclear goal threatens the \u201csecurity of the world.\u201d\u000a\u000a"North Korea's nuclear armament poses threats not only to the security of Northeast Asia, but also to the security of the world," Lee said. "It is urgently needed for the international community to make concerted efforts."

aVAutumn 1944. World War II is nearly over in Europe but is escalating in the Pacific, where American soldiers face an opponent who will go to any length to avoid defeat. The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. Killing the Rising Sun takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.\u000a\u000aAcross the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, Killing Patton, and Killing Reagan, this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before.

For many of God\u2019s children, they are an obstacle to worship in a sacred space; for some, these and other Confederate memorials serve as lampposts along a path that leads back to racial subjugation and oppression,\u201d the Cathedral said in a statement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe statement was signed by the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington; the Very Rev.

At the same time, more voters than not feel the United States is safer than before 9/11.\u000a\u000aBy a 6-point margin, more voters feel the country is safer today (47 percent safer vs. 41 percent less safe). That\u2019s a significant improvement from last August when a record 54 percent felt the country was less safe. Not since March 2014 have more felt safer than before the September 11 attacks (49-39 percent).\u000a\u000aCLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS\u000a\u000aTerrorists exacted a bloody toll on the West this year. The most recent major attack, in Barcelona and Cambrils, left 14 people dead, including one American. The deadliest was in Manchester at an Ariana Grande concert in May, where 22 people were killed and over 100 injured. And June 2016 saw the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, killing 49. ISIS claimed responsibility for all three attacks.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aWhile voters overall feel safer, partisanship appears to be the biggest factor driving opinions: Republicans (65 percent) and independents (48 percent) are more likely than Democrats (29 percent) to feel safer.

And they dismissed it. It had no lasting impact on the campaign. Yet, if you see the mainstream media that day, it was, literally, he was falling into Dante's Inferno.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon said then-Republican Party boss Reince Priebus also suggested Trump drop out.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump went around the room and asked people the percentages he thought of \u2026 still winning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Reince started off and Reince said ... \u2018You have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon claimed he was the last person to speak and told Trump, to the contrary: \u201cYou have 100 percent probability of winning."\u000a\u000aPriebus would go on to be Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, but was be replaced in July by former Homeland Security secretary John Kelly.\u000a\u000aBannon, who is back at the helm of Breitbart News after leaving the White House, also took more shots in the interview at what he called the \u201cRepublican establishment.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said they are \u201ctrying to nullify the 2016 election,\u201d pointing the finger at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \u201cand to a degree, [House Speaker] Paul Ryan.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented.

aVJ. Edgar Hoover\u2019s abuse of power as FBI director led Congress and the Justice Department to put new checks on that most powerful and secretive of offices. By the time Congress finishes investigating James Comey\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, those safeguards may be due for an update.\u000a\u000aPowerful as Hoover was, even he never simultaneously investigated both major-party candidates for the presidency. Mr. Comey did, and Americans are now getting a glimpse of how much he influenced political events.\u000a\u000aMr. Comey\u2019s actions in the Hillary Clinton email probe are concerning enough. He made himself investigator, judge and jury, breaking the Justice Department\u2019s chain of command. He publicly confirmed the investigation, violating the department\u2019s principles. He announced he would not recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, even as he publicly excoriated her\u2014an extraordinary abuse of his megaphone. Then he rekindled the case only 11 days before the election.\u000a\u000aAn inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee has now shown that Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation was a charade. He wrote a draft statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton in May, long before he bothered to interview her or her staff. This at least finally explains the probe\u2019s lackluster nature: the absence of a grand jury, the failure to follow up on likely perjury, the unorthodox immunity deals made with Clinton aides.\u000a\u000aBut the big development this week is a new look at how Mr. Comey may have similarly juked the probe into Donald Trump\u2019s purported ties to Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation took a sharp and notable turn on Tuesday, as news broke that it had subpoenaed the FBI and the Justice Department for information relating to the infamous Trump \u201cdossier.\u201d That dossier, whose allegations appear to have been fabricated, was commissioned by the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and then developed by a former British spook named Christopher Steele.\u000a\u000aRead more of Kimberley Strassel's column in the Wall Street Journal.\u000a\u000aKimberley Strassel writes the Potomac Watch column for the Wall Street Journal where she is a member of the editorial board.

In addition, a large panoramic roof lets in plenty of light and makes the space feel even bigger. There are six seats spread over three rows, but count on the production version to have seven seats. Materials used include leather (a mix of white and dark, olive-bronze), open-pore ash wood, and matte and polished aluminum.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s also no missing the numerous digital screens.

The tweet that accompanied the photo said \u201cThis is the future that ACLU members want.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithin moments, the tweet was descended upon from the corners of the outrage twitter-sphere because that\u2019s what social media is now. The great social injustice committed here by the ACLU? The child in the picture was white and therefore declared as racist and propping up white supremacists. Senior Guardian columnist Steven Thrasher posted a humorous gif of Blackish star Anthony Anderson crying while others took it a bit more seriously.\u000a\u000aBut other than a handful of verified twitter users, there wasn\u2019t really a catch-fire moment. It wasn\u2019t picked up by media outlets or journalists on Twitter. There was a minor firestorm over a picture that attracted scant attention but in the end that didn\u2019t matter.\u000a\u000aWithin the hour, however, the ACLU posted a weird retraction of the image, stating \u201cWhen your Twitter followers keep you in check and remind you that white supremacy is everywhere,\u201d along with a Kermit the Frog gif.

aVBy The Associated Press\u000a\u000aLOS ANGELES \u2013 Dick Gregory, the comedian and activist and who broke racial barriers in the 1960s and used his humor to spread messages of social justice and nutritional health, has died. He was 84.\u000a\u000aGregory died late Saturday in Washington, D.C. after being hospitalized for about a week, his son Christian Gregory told The Associated Press. He had suffered a severe bacterial infection.\u000a\u000aAs one of the first black standup comedians to find success with white audiences, in the early 1960s, Gregory rose from an impoverished childhood in St. Louis to win a college track scholarship and become a celebrated satirist who deftly commented upon racial divisions at the dawn of the civil rights movement.\u000a\u000a"Where else in the world but America," he joked, "could I have lived in the worst neighborhoods, attended the worst schools, rode in the back of the bus, and get paid $5,000 a week just for talking about it?"\u000a\u000aGregory's sharp commentary soon led him into civil rights activism, where his ability to woo audiences through humor helped bring national attention to fledgling efforts at integration and social equality for blacks.

aVRICHMOND, Va. (WTVR) -- A man is recovering at VCU Medical Center, hours removed from brain surgery, after he was attacked and beaten outside a Shockoe Bottom pizzeria early Wednesday morning.\u000a\u000aCrime Insider sources tell Jon Burkett that from looking at surveillance video, the attack that nearly killed him, came out of nowhere.\u000a\u000aStanding outside a pizza place at the corner of 18th and Main Streets, two men were attacked, according to police.\u000a\u000aCrime Insider sources said the 28-year-old victim was hit so hard in his temple that he stiffened and fell hard to the concrete sidewalk.\u000a\u000a"It's impossible to stop every psycho that will beat someone up over a slice of pizza. It's a cultural problem that we can't have in Shockoe Bottom,\u201d David Napier, president of the Shockoe Bottom Association, said.\u000a\u000aPolice have not confirmed the motive for the attack but sources said it appeared to be a random attack.\u000a\u000aThose same sources said the victim, who was still in critical condition, appeared on the pizza shop surveillance video, suffering the vicious beating. The second victim suffered minor injuries.\u000a\u000aWhen reached on the phone, the victim's mother said she was disheartened and concerned. She said it was a shame you can't stand outside without the fear of getting pummeled for no reason.\u000a\u000a"The buck stops with the mayor,\u201d said Napier. \u201cHe got to take a hard look at it. It's his city for the next four to eight years. We'd love to work with him in any way possible. The officers that I know would want this problem to go away. We just need to re think our strategy a little bit.\u201d\u000a\u000aNapier said that this type of crime can cause what he calls the "economic engine" of this city to sputter, and hopes police catch whoever attacked the men.\u000a\u000a"We have a very bad look right now because there's so much construction in the market. But when all of this is built out by next summer, we're going to have a beautiful downtown city center.

aVThis novella by New York Times bestselling author William R. Forstchen imagines a horrifying scenario where, in the course of one day, the terrorist group ISIS carries out massacres in schools and on highways across the United States. With a surprisingly small but well-organized and ruthless force, the nightmarish devastation brings America to a state of near-paralysis.\u000a\u000aAuthor of ONE SECOND AFTER and PILLAR TO THE SKY, this heart-stopping novella brings home just how fragile our defenses and infrastructure really are. It is also a story of heroic efforts to save lives, while sounding a wake-up call to American citizens and their government.\u000a\u000aStory: Bob Petersen arrives with his daughter at the Middle Grade school in Maine where he teaches, expecting another regular day but worried about what recent ominous news reports might portend. Suddenly his school -- along with many others across the United States -- is under attack. Gunmen burst in, slaughtering children and adults alike.\u000a\u000aFrom the ISIS leader in Syria, to the murderous rampages throughout the U.S., Day of Wrath reveals with chilling effect how national panic and paralyzing terror at the spiraling violence can bring a mighty country to a near-standstill. Petersen's fight to save lives and stop the merciless gunmen provides edge-of-the-seat drama. Day of Wrath is a provocative work that should stimulate an intense national debate.

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages.

aVBy Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJ. Edgar Hoover\u2019s abuse of power as FBI director led Congress and the Justice Department to put new checks on that most powerful and secretive of offices. By the time Congress finishes investigating James Comey\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, those safeguards may be due for an update.\u000a\u000aPowerful as Hoover was, even he never simultaneously investigated both major-party candidates for the presidency. Mr. Comey did, and Americans are now getting a glimpse of how much he influenced political events.\u000a\u000aMr. Comey\u2019s actions in the Hillary Clinton email probe are concerning enough. He made himself investigator, judge and jury, breaking the Justice Department\u2019s chain of command. He publicly confirmed the investigation, violating the department\u2019s principles. He announced he would not recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, even as he publicly excoriated her\u2014an extraordinary abuse of his megaphone. Then he rekindled the case only 11 days before the election.\u000a\u000aAn inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee has now shown that Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation was a charade. He wrote a draft statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton in May, long before he bothered to interview her or her staff. This at least finally explains the probe\u2019s lackluster nature: the absence of a grand jury, the failure to follow up on likely perjury, the unorthodox immunity deals made with Clinton aides.\u000a\u000aBut the big development this week is a new look at how Mr. Comey may have similarly juked the probe into Donald Trump\u2019s purported ties to Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation took a sharp and notable turn on Tuesday, as news broke that it had subpoenaed the FBI and the Justice Department for information relating to the infamous Trump \u201cdossier.\u201d That dossier, whose allegations appear to have been fabricated, was commissioned by the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and then developed by a former British spook named Christopher Steele.

aVYou can\u2019t make it up. After seven years of promising conservative voters they would repeal and replace, and raising tens of millions off the issue, Republicans are now doubling down in support of ObamaCare. In fact, they are actually going to make ObamaCare worse.\u000a\u000aHow so?\u000a\u000aAs impossible as it may seem to believe, Republicans in Washington and the states are working to bail out ObamaCare and simultaneously bring back ObamaCare tax increases that Barack Obama himself suspended because they were driving up health care costs.\u000a\u000aLet that sink in.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of their faux attempt to repeal ObamaCare, many Establishment Republicans have embraced ObamaCare\u2019s so-called cost-sharing subsidies. Commonly known as CRSs, these subsidies are payments the federal government makes to insurers to help offset the high costs of ObamaCare customers.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s clear Republicans were never serious about ObamaCare repeal and now they are in fact actively working to support some of the very worst parts of ObamaCare.\u000a\u000aJust a few years ago, House Republicans actually sued the Obama administration over CSRs, arguing, correctly, that the payments were unconstitutional because they had never been authorized by Congress. Permanent authorization of CSRs is now the top health care priority for Congressional Democrats.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s be honest about what these \u201cCSRs\u201d are. These are taxpayer-funded payments that go directly from the federal government to insurance companies that sell ObamaCare policies. You can call them whatever you like; corporate welfare, crony capitalism, but these are unconstitutional bailouts specifically designed to prop up ObamaCare and mask its true cost.\u000a\u000aBut wait: it gets worse. Much worse. Not only are Establishment Republicans poised to bail out ObamaCare, they are simultaneously going to allow the return of two suspended ObamaCare taxes. In other words, they are going to let taxes go up on their watch.\u000a\u000aCongress suspended the ObamaCare taxes on health insurance and medical devices for 2017 because they were raising health care costs and killing jobs. Even Democrats, Obama included, supported the suspension.\u000a\u000aThe medical device tax crushes jobs, discourages innovation and makes the U.S. less competitive in the global marketplace for medical technology. These are the jobs every economist agrees that we want: high-paying, manufacturing jobs in a growth sector.\u000a\u000aMoreover, every dollar medical device makers spend on this tax is a dollar that isn\u2019t spent developing the next medical innovation.\u000a\u000aThen there is the ObamaCare excise tax on your health insurance. This part of ObamaCare is particularly insidious. Like all excise taxes, it gets paid by consumers, not companies. So not only are we the taxpayers subsidizing insurance companies, those same insurers have made very clear that they will pass every red cent of this tax squarely on to their policyholders.\u000a\u000aBut wait yet again: it does actually get worse. In this scenario, Big Business and Big Labor are off the hook. Why? Because they cut a backroom deal to help pass ObamaCare, they are exempt from the tax on health insurance. So this tax is mostly paid by small businesses and seniors. According to a number of studies from actuaries and conservative economists, this tax will raise premiums by about $500 in 2018.\u000a\u000aTo make matters worse, a group of Establishment Governors from both parties has hatched a plan to suspend the tax on health insurance\u2014but only for certain people on ObamaCare, while letting it return to raise premiums on the vast majority of Americans. This \u201cbipartisan\u201d ObamaCare rescue plan was widely praised by the mainstream media. Establishment Republican Governors are proposing to cut health care taxes for ObamaCare but raise them for small business and seniors\u2014the very people who put Republicans in office.\u000a\u000aBoth of these ObamaCare taxes are set to go back into effect January 1, 2018. Congressional Republicans could use their majorities to repeal or even just further suspend these taxes. Instead, they are willingly, some might say cheerfully, working with Democrats to bailout ObamaCare.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t be fooled by all the spin coming out of Capitol Hill and all the false promises about repeal and lower taxes. To add even more insult to Mitch McConnell\u2019s infamous \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d remarks, it\u2019s clear Republicans were never serious about ObamaCare repeal and now they are in fact actively working to support some of the very worst parts of ObamaCare. At a time when Republicans control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, their real health care agenda\u2014the one that they will actually pass\u2014is all about helping their insurance buddies with bailouts and tax increases.\u000a\u000aNed Ryun is the Founder and CEO of American Majority, a national grassroots organization.

aVBy Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJ. Edgar Hoover\u2019s abuse of power as FBI director led Congress and the Justice Department to put new checks on that most powerful and secretive of offices. By the time Congress finishes investigating James Comey\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, those safeguards may be due for an update.\u000a\u000aPowerful as Hoover was, even he never simultaneously investigated both major-party candidates for the presidency. Mr. Comey did, and Americans are now getting a glimpse of how much he influenced political events.\u000a\u000aMr. Comey\u2019s actions in the Hillary Clinton email probe are concerning enough. He made himself investigator, judge and jury, breaking the Justice Department\u2019s chain of command. He publicly confirmed the investigation, violating the department\u2019s principles. He announced he would not recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, even as he publicly excoriated her\u2014an extraordinary abuse of his megaphone. Then he rekindled the case only 11 days before the election.\u000a\u000aAn inquiry by the Senate Judiciary Committee has now shown that Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation was a charade. He wrote a draft statement exonerating Mrs. Clinton in May, long before he bothered to interview her or her staff. This at least finally explains the probe\u2019s lackluster nature: the absence of a grand jury, the failure to follow up on likely perjury, the unorthodox immunity deals made with Clinton aides.\u000a\u000aBut the big development this week is a new look at how Mr. Comey may have similarly juked the probe into Donald Trump\u2019s purported ties to Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation took a sharp and notable turn on Tuesday, as news broke that it had subpoenaed the FBI and the Justice Department for information relating to the infamous Trump \u201cdossier.\u201d That dossier, whose allegations appear to have been fabricated, was commissioned by the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and then developed by a former British spook named Christopher Steele.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026. [to] what's right for you," such as narrow or wide, Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aParents can turn off the camera if they choose to monitor only the sound. Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted. Parents can dress up Arlo Baby to look like a rabbit (with snap-on ears and feet) , a Dalmatian, or a cat.\u000a\u000aIt also records video, so busy parents don't have to miss milestones like their baby\u2019s first words or first steps.\u000a\u000a"If one parent is on the road, you can use your smartphone and get access to a live feed from the camera, and type in your password to get into the app and see what baby's doing at any time of the day," Falgiano said.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aUsers can talk to their babies when they\u2019re away, thanks to the monitor\u2019s two-way audio.

aVDespite being dead for years, hundreds of veterans remained on the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) payroll and received nearly $38 million in benefits, according to a report from the Social Security inspector general.\u000a\u000aThe report showed inaccurate death records at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the VA\u2019s failure to share monthly death reports with the SSA. The communication gap resulted in an estimated $37.7 million being inappropriately doled out to 746 people.\u000a\u000aThat number could rise more than $7 million over the next year if the issues aren\u2019t resolved, the inspector general said, according to the Washington Times.\u000a\u000aAfter cross-referencing the VA\u2019s records with the Social Security\u2019s database, the audit found nearly 4,000 cases in which payments were sent to people listed as dead.\u000a\u000aIt was based on a sample size of 100 names that were listed as dead under the VA, but were never shared with Social Security, the Times reported.\u000a\u000aThe SSA laid the blame on the VA for failing to provide accurate information.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have notified the VA of our concerns with their data and they are reviewing the issue internally,\u201d Stephanie Hall, acting deputy chief of staff at the SSA, told Stars and Stripes. \u201cWe will continue to process death reports we receive from the VA per our policy, but we are unable to control the accuracy of the information VA provides.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, a VA spokesperson told the Washington Times, that \u201cthe vast majority of the records VA provided SSA in 2016 were accurate,\u201d but \u201cis reviewing the information we share with the Social Security Administration to ensure we are providing the most complete and up-to-date information possible.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe VA has had a history confusing the living and the dead dating back more than a decade.

Those same forces rose against Pelosi again after Democrats failed to capture a single seat in a string of special elections.\u000a\u000aPelosi sunk to her lowest ebb after each of those episodes, while still declaring herself a "master legislator" as she vowed to stay on.\u000a\u000aBut for the time being, Pelosi is close once again to power.\u000a\u000aTrump, of course, has always been volatile and could turn on the Dem deal-makers in an instant.\u000a\u000aAfter Wednesday, predicting his impulses is harder than forecasting hurricane spaghetti models.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the pushback from conservatives is strong.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Walker, who chairs the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest bloc of conservatives in the House, declared Monday that the \u201cdebt ceiling should be paired with significant fiscal and structural reforms.\u201d He said that if the GOP failed to tackle the debt, \u201cit only shows that Republicans do not take the problem of our $20 trillion debt seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy Thursday morning, Walker dashed off a letter to Ryan. Walker informed the speaker the RSC opposed the plan to couple Harvey aid with an interim spending bill and a debt ceiling hike. That meant Ryan would turn to Pelosi and Democrats to carry the day.\u000a\u000aMultiple House Republicans suggested the speaker may have been asleep at the switch. They noted he\u2019s been barnstorming the country on tax reform \u2013 yet never developed a plan to address the debt limit or slash spending. One senior House Republican who asked not to be identified suggested that Ryan would have been in a stronger negotiating position with Trump had he cobbled together a debt ceiling/offset blueprint \u2013 even if it were just for show. Absent that, the president sided with Pelosi.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, Hurricane Harvey and now Irma force the government to burn emergency cash at an Olympic rate. These storms will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Such unexpected, staggering spending meant the government had an imminent rendezvous with the debt ceiling \u2013 rather than Sept. 29 as suggested by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The storm scenario demanded Congress act \u2013 now. Otherwise, hurricane victims would be left without assistance. A debt limit collision could spark a market shock.\u000a\u000aThe debt ceiling suspension and government funding plan expire Dec. 8. Think Republicans will provide the votes to sidestep either crisis then? Or who has the leverage? How about Pelosi & Co. offering Democratic votes in exchange for a legislative fix for DACA?\u000a\u000aBy the way, where\u2019s the money for the border wall?\u000a\u000aYou thought this month was going to be rough on Capitol Hill? December is the new September.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the second debt limit could be harder now,\u201d predicted House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\u000a\u000a\u201cBetter deals are made in January than trying to jam things through a few days before Christmas,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\u000a\u000aLike Walker, Meadows lamented the lack of deficit reduction or opportunities to offset the hurricane aid. He\u2019s dubious Congress will ever adopt tax reform considering there\u2019s much chatter yet no specifics.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of the things we campaigned on were a mirage off in the distance,\u201d said Meadows.\u000a\u000aCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

aVBy Ned Ryun, Fox News\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t make it up. After seven years of promising conservative voters they would repeal and replace, and raising tens of millions off the issue, Republicans are now doubling down in support of ObamaCare. In fact, they are actually going to make ObamaCare worse.\u000a\u000aHow so?\u000a\u000aAs impossible as it may seem to believe, Republicans in Washington and the states are working to bail out ObamaCare and simultaneously bring back ObamaCare tax increases that Barack Obama himself suspended because they were driving up health care costs.\u000a\u000aLet that sink in.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of their faux attempt to repeal ObamaCare, many Establishment Republicans have embraced ObamaCare\u2019s so-called cost-sharing subsidies. Commonly known as CRSs, these subsidies are payments the federal government makes to insurers to help offset the high costs of ObamaCare customers.\u000a\u000aJust a few years ago, House Republicans actually sued the Obama administration over CSRs, arguing, correctly, that the payments were unconstitutional because they had never been authorized by Congress. Permanent authorization of CSRs is now the top health care priority for Congressional Democrats.

aVBy Howard Kurtz, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aMany Republicans are shocked that President Trump did a budget deal with the Democrats, opting for \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d in an Oval Office meeting over Paul and Mitch.\u000a\u000aThey shouldn\u2019t be.\u000a\u000aWhether the three-month debt ceiling agreement is a fleeting political maneuver or a presidential hammer against his own party, it\u2019s not terribly surprising. Trump has been increasingly frustrated with McConnell and Ryan for failing to pass much of anything since he took office. So he struck a deal with Schumer and Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThe move underscores what I\u2019ve always maintained about Donald Trump, that he\u2019s basically an independent president. He\u2019s a onetime Democrat who vanquished the Republican establishment, but has never been wedded to GOP orthodoxy.

aVNew data suggest that more than 5,000 people who cast ballots in New Hampshire in the 2016 U.S. presidential election might not have been residents of the state.\u000a\u000aThese voters likely used out-of-state driver\u2019s licenses and have not since obtained an in-state license or registered a vehicle.\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, released the data Thursday following his inquiries to the state\u2019s Department of State and the Department of Safety, which supervise elections.\u000a\u000aThe new figures could potentially call into question the validity of the New Hampshire results for Nov. 8, when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton outpolled Republican nominee Donald Trump by a mere 2,736 votes.\u000a\u000aConservatives have long criticized certain practices of voter registration, such as same-day registration, claiming lax rules invite fraud and abuse of the electoral system, the Washington Times reported.\u000a\u000aIn February, White House adviser Stephen Miller came under fire for suggesting that nonresident Democratic Party voters arrived in droves to New Hampshire to vote for Clinton.\u000a\u000aMiller told ABC in February: \u201cHaving worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who\u2019s worked in New Hampshire politics. It\u2019s very real. It\u2019s very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post described Miller\u2019s claim as \u201cthe same bogus talking points that have been repeatedly shown to be false.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe figures obtained by Jasper, however, reveal the potential abuse of the voting procedure. According to the data, 6,540 people registered to vote, and voted in the New Hampshire election, provided just out-of-state license.\u000a\u000aOnly 15 percent, roughly about 1,014 of the voters, have since obtained the in-state license, while 200 other people had since registered a vehicle in the state.\u000a\u000aDespite New Hampshire law mandating that drivers acquire a state driving license within 60 days of becoming a resident in the state, more than 80 percent of people who registered to vote with out-of-state licenses still had not received their in-state license or registered a new vehicle \u2013 nearly 10 months after the election.\u000a\u000aIn addition, 196 people were under investigation for voting in two states.\u000a\u000aRecently, three elections in New Hampshire were won by fewer than 5,000 votes, the Concord Patch reported. Clinton won against Trump by 2,736 votes, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan beat U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes and U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter won against incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by 4,900 votes.\u000a\u000aDemocrats have fired back at the new data, calling it an attempt to use \u201cselective data and misinformation\u201d to justify claims made by the White House about the voter fraud.\u000a\u000aState Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley claimed Jasper \u201cselectively requested information about voters who registered with out-of-state licenses, an entirely legal and normal practice. They can easily be accounted for by college students and other new Granite Staters who deferred acquiring an in-state license or don't intend to drive in the state,\u201d WMUR9 reported.\u000a\u000aState Senate Democratic Leader Jeff Woodburn seconded: \u201cUsing cherry-picked data in order to support a false claim is dangerous and irresponsible. Today\u2019s release of information by Speaker Jasper\u2019s office fans the flames of misinformation in order to further suppress our citizens\u2019 right to vote.\u201d\u000a\u000aJasper addressed the criticism that the figures can be accounted with just college students, claiming there were multiple people who \u201cdid not comply with the law.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCollege students are eligible to vote if they declare domicile here, but anybody who does that then has to comply with the laws of the state,\u201d he said, according to WMUR9. \u201cIf someone is domiciled in New Hampshire (and has a vehicle), then within 60 days, they need to obtain a driver\u2019s license. I think we will find that within that 5,000, there will be many who did not comply with the law.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two state agencies that issued the data to Jaspers also released an explanation of why certain people could have voted without having an in-state driving license or have registered the vehicle even 10 months later after the election.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is likely that some unknown number of these individuals moved out of New Hampshire, it is possible that a few may have never driven in New Hampshire or have ceased driving, however, it is expected that an unknown number of the remainder continue to live and drive in New Hampshire. If they have established their residence in New Hampshire, they may have failed to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license,\u201d wrote Safety Commissioner John Barthelmes and Secretary of State Bill Gardner.\u000a\u000aThe letter does not suggest all people who voted with out-of-state driving licenses voted illegally.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aBy Jessica Rosenthal, FOX News Radio Reporter\u000a\u000aWhat would you give up to fix our broken healthcare system?\u000a\u000aWe've heard a lot about healthcare from politicians over the past decade, mostly surrounding Obamacare. This summer though Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and so it remains the law of the land.\u000a\u000aBut many working on the front lines of healthcare and dealing with it every day, say the healthcare system we have in this country is, unhealthy. Words to describe it, like, "broken," were thrown around by doctors. Patients feel it's frustrating and limited. One patient advocate called the system "insane." They point to high cost and lack of communication, and wonder, should the healthcare insurance system be non-profit?\u000a\u000aIt once was.\u000a\u000aJust as the Great Depression was beginning, Blue Cross plans were being created. Meant to increase access to healthcare at Baylor University's hospital in Texas, "a non-profit prepaid mechanism," was created, according to a Consumers Union report about the history of healthcare insurance. These plans became popular during the 1930's and operated based on "care before profit." But over time, more groups like the elderly and poor, were being left out of these mostly employment based plans. Medicare and Medicaid were created. And by the 1970's for-profit insurance companies were providing stiff competition.\u000a\u000aSome of the doctors with whom we spoke for our hour long special report "Healthcare Checkup," said a for-profit insurance system is the problem. Their reimbursement rates from Medicare, private insurance, and especially Medicaid, keep decreasing. And most health care dollars stay with the insurance companies. Emergency Room Dr. Alan Heilpern said, "insurance companies don't do any healthcare. The insurance company doesn't work with me in the emergency department at 2 AM taking care of someone vomiting up blood. But they're taking a large amount of the money that is available in the healthcare system."\u000a\u000aRetired physician Mitch Leventhal disagrees, "you really want to know who's responsible for the high cost of medical care? Look in the mirror!" He says patients demand too much, especially use of technology, which is expensive. Both doctors agree some sort of rationing of care is required to keep costs down. Heilpern says the system tries to give everything to everyone and it can no longer do so.\u000a\u000aPatients blame a lack of communication among doctors, inefficient and lazy keeping of medical records, and high costs for their frustration. Los Angeles resident Shayna Sorrentino, has been dealing with flaring pain off and on for years and has been engaged in an ongoing effort with multiple doctors and trips to the Mayo Clinic, to determine precisely what is wrong. She dreads going to her mailbox, "Not for any other bills than medical ones. Because what if it's that one thing that you got the prior authorization for and it's still denied?"\u000a\u000aThe two healthcare insurance company executives who agreed to be interviewed concur about why costs are so high. Gene Rapasardi with Cigna, says technology has improved, which is more expensive. Adding "there are whole new classes of medications out there, especially specialty drugs, that are really miraculous in what they're doing but they're expensive. Craig Hankins with United Health Care agreed saying, "Healthcare is becoming more expensive because of new advancing technologies that are more expensive, the cost and role of prescription medications has grown significantly as well."\u000a\u000aWe reached out to several pharmaceutical companies none would comment for this report. But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America did. Priscilla Vanderveer with Pharma says they know costs are high. But they try to negotiate with insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers. "Those insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers are getting bigger and bigger discounts and rebates, and they're not being passed on," to the patients.\u000a\u000aVanderveer blamed the media in part for the perception that prices are high. "What often is covered in the media, are the list prices...when the reality of the marketplace is that the actual cost of medicines to health insurers particularly but also to the broader drug supply chain are not increasing at rates that you might think based on media coverage." She says a third of all spending goes to others in that supply chain, including those pharmacy benefit managers, insurers, drug distributors and wholesalers, and others.\u000a\u000aLawyers who sue insurance companies on behalf of patients, blame insurance companies for looking for ways to deny claims. Even though under the affordable care act, they have to spend 80% paying out premiums. Attorneys David Lilienstein said "there is no way a for profit insurance company should be deciding who gets healthcare." Attorney Scott Glovsky agreed with some of the doctors about how things should work. Basic government provided coverage for all, and if you want extra, you pay for additional private insurance on top of that.\u000a\u000aSo what's a sick person to do with all this?\u000a\u000aPatient advocates help navigate peoples' healthcare bills, claim denials, appeals, and much more on behalf of patients. They want people to negotiate their bills. And know what their coverage plan provides. If it's too hard to understand the plan, call the provider and ask someone to go line by line through the coverage agreement. Advocate Lisa Berry Blackstock argues every procedure can be negotiated. She urges people to use healthcarebluebook.com to find out the true cost of the care they are receiving. And find out what the "cash price" is for care. People without insurance often pay the cash price, which is often less than what doctors and hospitals bill insurance companies.\u000a\u000aIn this hour long special "Fox News Radio's Healthcare Checkup," we examined what's wrong with healthcare and how to fix it, according to those on the front lines; the patients, advocates, attorneys, doctors, insurance executives and more.\u000a\u000aFollow Jessica Rosenthal on Twitter: @JessicaFOXNews

aVAt least 32 people died in a historically massive earthquake that struck the southern coast of Mexico early Friday, toppling hotels and houses and prompting tsunami waves and power outages.\u000a\u000aThe United States Geological Survey said that a magnitude 8.1 quake hit about 73 miles off Tres Picos, Mexico, along Mexico's southern coast.\u000a\u000aIts epicenter was 102 miles west of Tapachula in southern Chiapas state and had a depth of about 21 miles. The quake was so powerful, it sent people fleeing from buildings 650 miles away in Mexico City.\u000a\u000aPresident Enrique Pena Nieto said the earthquake is the biggest the country has seen in a century. He said that 62 aftershocks followed the quake and it's possible one as strong as 7.2 could hit in the next 24 hours.\u000a\u000aChiapas' Gov. Manuel Velasco told Milenio TV that at least three people have been killed in the region and 10 died in Oazaca, close to the quake's epicenter. He said the quake damaged hospitals and schools. Two children also died in Tabasco state.\u000a\u000aOne of them was killed when a wall collapsed, and the other was a baby who died in a children's hospital that lost electricity, cutting off the infant's ventilator.\u000a\u000aThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center early Friday confirmed tsunami waves in Mexico, with the largest wave so far measuring 2.3 feet.\u000a\u000aSmaller tsunami waves were observed on the coast or measured by ocean gauges in several other places. The center's forecast said Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala could see waves of a meter or less.\u000a\u000aCivil protection officials in Mexico were checking for damage in Chiapas, but the quake was so powerful that frightened residents in Mexico City fled apartment buildings, often in their pajamas, and gathered in groups in the street.\u000a\u000aAround midnight buildings swayed strongly for more than minute, loosening light fixtures from ceilings. Helicopters crisscrossed the sky above Mexico City with spotlights.\u000a\u000aZhaira Franco, 35, who was in Mexico City, told The New York Times that she heard an alarm for about 30 seconds before feeling the quake. She said her building swayed so much that it hit the building next door.\u000a\u000a"The house moved like chewing gum and the light and internet went out momentarily," said Rodrigo Soberanes, who lives near San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, a poor largely indigenous state popular with tourists.\u000a\u000aCivil Defense in Chiapas said on its Twitter account that its personnel were in the streets aiding people and warned residents to prepare for aftershocks. But it made no immediate comment about damage\u000a\u000aThe USGS reported a magnitude 5.7 aftershock about 12 minutes later. There have been up to 13 aftershocks.\u000a\u000aIn neighboring Guatemala, President Jimmy Morales spoke on national television to call for calm while emergency crews checked for damage. Local radio in the Central American country reported one death, but it could not be confirmed.\u000a\u000a"We have reports of some damage and the death of one person, even though we still don't have exact details," Morales said. He said the possible death occurred in San Marcos state near the border with Mexico.\u000a\u000aLucy Jones, a seismologist in California who works with the U.S. Geological Survey, said such a quake was to be expected.\u000a\u000a"Off the west coast of Mexico is what's called the subduction zone, the Pacific Plate is moving under the Mexican peninsula," she said. "It's a very flat fault, so it's a place that has big earthquakes relatively often because of that."\u000a\u000a"There's likely to be a small tsunami going to the southwest. It's not going to be coming up and affecting California or Hawaii," she said. "For tsunami generation, an 8 is relatively small."\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report

aVHurricane Irma\u2019s powerful winds are expected to cause severe damage to houses and buildings on its trajectory toward Florida and the Carolinas. Here are several precautions that can minimize structural damage to doors, windows and exteriors.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t put tape over your windows\u000a\u000aThe National Hurricane Center and the Atlantic Oceanographic Meteorological Laboratory agree: Affixing tape over your windows is a waste of time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does not protect your windows,\u201d said Bill Read, the former National Hurricane Center director, in a 2012 statement to the Associated Press. \u201cAt best, it's an inconvenience. At worst, some people have the illusion that they're safe \u2026 and people can get severely hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHURRICANE-PROOF YOUR KITCHEN WITH THESE THREE TIPS\u000a\u000aInstall shutters\u000a\u000aThe more useful option, according to FloridaDisaster.org and the National Hurricane Center, is to secure your windows with boards or shutters. Commercial shutters, which can be found at hardware stores, or installed by professional contactors, should ideally be installed before a hurricane warning is issued. Aside from those, the National Hurricane Center advises installing recessed plywood boards over windows, which provide more protection than merely affixing plywood boards that overlap the window frames. The National Hurricane Center has a comprehensive list of instructions for cutting and installing these types of recessed plywood shutters.\u000a\u000aWindow films and shatter-resistant glass may provide some protection, though \u201cthey are no substitute for shutters,\u201d according to the NHC. Furthermore, FloridaDisaster.org writes that \u201cexperts and \u2026 building codes do not consider window film to be an adequate protection for windows of homes in hurricane-prone areas.\u201d\u000a\u000aSecure your doors\u000a\u000aDoors, too, would benefit from commercial or plywood shutters, especially \u201csliding glass doors, French doors, or any door with considerable glass in it,\u201d suggest the NHC. In the case of French or double doors, FloridaDisaster.org advises installing additional barrel bolt latches that extend into the header and floor.\u000a\u000aFROM DEPP TO DE NIRO: CELEBRITY PROPERTIES RIGHT IN IRMA'S PATH\u000a\u000aGarage doors are also susceptible \u2014 especially if they\u2019re not hurricane-rated \u2014 and should be shuttered or braced appropriately. Check with hardware stores for garage door retrofitting systems or braces to prevent the door from buckling inward. Braces and retrofitting kits, however, usually don\u2019t offer protection against impact. Weather.com offers other safety precautions one can take to further secure a garage door, including reinforcing them with wooden or metal girds.\u000a\u000aPrevent water entry where you can\u000a\u000aVents or ventilation systems near attics or clothes dryers should be fitted with close-fitting shutters or plates, depending on what kind of vents they are. FloridaDisaster.org offers instructions for securing off-ridge vents, ridge vents, gable vents and soffit vents.\u000a\u000aCaulking can also be applied around window frames, door jambs and shutters to further protect against water entry.\u000a\u000aClean up the yard\u000a\u000aReady.gov recommends trimming tree branches, or removing damaged trees entirely, to keep them from coming loose in high winds and becoming projectiles. For the same reasons, toys, lawn furniture, decorations, small potted plants, and trash and recycling bins should be brought inside, if possible. SouthFlorida.com further recommends disassembling trampolines and bringing them into the garage. The same goes for swing sets and barbecue/fire pits, if possible, notes NOLA.com.\u000a\u000aFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\u000a\u000aPrepare for the future\u000a\u000aFEMA further advises that homeowners in hurricane-prone areas take precautions for future hurricanes, with tips for reinforcing or updating windows, doors and roofs with more permanent solutions in the event of an incoming storm.

aVFOX NEWS - Jerry Lewis, the rubber-faced, squeaky-voiced comedy legend who starred in movies and musicals and also was known for his unflagging work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, died on Sunday, his publicist confirmed. He was 91 years old.\u000a\u000aLewis' publicist confirmed the news to The Associated Press. The Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist John Katsilometes first reported Lewis' death.\u000a\u000aLewis "passed peacefully at home this morning of natural causes at the age of 91 with his loving family by his side," manager Mark Rozzano said.\u000a\u000aLewis had gone through a series of health problems and scares in recent years. In June 2012 he was hospitalized for two nights in New York after collapsing with what was reported to be a low blood sugar problem.\u000a\u000aHe was forced to cancel a fund-raising show in Australia due to poor health in June 2011.\u000a\u000aLewis had been touring Australia to raise money for the country's Muscular Dystrophy Foundation, which is separate from the American association, where he served as president.\u000a\u000aHe announced in 2011 he was retiring as host of the association's Labor Day Telethon, which he began hosting in 1966.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, Lewis also suffered from a back condition linked to a comedic pratfall from a piano, as well as heart problems. He reportedly had at least two heart attacks.\u000a\u000aThe comedian who first gained fame as part of a duo with singer Dean Martin was born Joseph Levitch on March 16, 1926 in Newark, New Jersey.\u000a\u000aHis parents were entertainers and young Jerry made his debut at age five on New York's Catskill Mountains entertainment circuit.\u000a\u000aHe began using the professional name Joey Lewis, but later changed it to Jerry, reportedly to avoid confusion with comedian Joe E. Lewis.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1946, Lewis teamed up with Martin \u2013 first with a nightclub act, then radio and television appearances. Martin was the suave, debonair singer while Lewis was the zany, boyish sidekick with the huge grin and squeaky voice.\u000a\u000aThey went on to make a series of movies together before the partnership ended in 1956 and both launched successful solo careers.\u000a\u000aLewis became a major comedy star with his first solo film, 1957's "The Delicate Delinquent," followed by "Rock-A-Bye Baby" and "The Geisha Boy." His later films included "The Bellboy," "Cinderfella," "The Nutty Professor" and "The King of Comedy."\u000a\u000aHe also appeared in stage musicals and in 1994 made his Broadway debut as the Devil in a revival of "Damn Yankees."\u000a\u000aLewis was consistently respected abroad and a perennial favorite of French critics, sometimes to the amusement of fans at home. In 2006 the French Minister of Culture awarded him the Legion d'Honneur, saying he was the 'French people's favorite clown."

aVA California judge ruled that a teen girl who was declared brain dead more than three years ago after a tonsillectomy may technically still be alive, allowing a malpractice lawsuit against the hospital to move forward and possibly setting up the family to have her care paid for if they succeed.\u000a\u000aAlameda County Judge Stephen Pulido ruled Tuesday that it's up to a jury to determine whether Jahi McMath is alive, which would increase the damages jurors could award if they determine doctors at Children's Hospital in Oakland botched a routine operation to remove the girl's tonsils.\u000a\u000a4-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIAN BOY FIGHTS FATAL DISEASE WITH NEW TREATMENT\u000a\u000aIn California, non-economic damages such as pain and suffering are capped at $250,000 for medical malpractice. But juries can award unlimited economic damages far above that cap for ongoing medical care, which Jahi's family could not claim if she were declared dead.\u000a\u000aJahi's case has been at the center of national debate over brain death since the girl's mother refused to remove her daughter from life support after doctors declared the then-13-year-old dead after surgery in December 2013.\u000a\u000aDoctors say she had irreversible brain damage from a lack of oxygen and suffered cardiac arrest. A coroner signed a death certificate the following month.\u000a\u000aThe girl is connected to a ventilator and receives medical care in New Jersey, the only U.S. state that accommodates religions that don't recognize brain death.\u000a\u000aChris Dolan, who represents the family in a federal lawsuit seeking to rescind Jahi's death certificate, said the family was "overjoyed" with the judge's ruling.\u000a\u000aHARVEY FIRST RESPONDER CONTRACTS FLESH-EATING BACTERIA INFECTION\u000a\u000a"It's literally a matter of life and death," said Dolan, who is seeking the unprecedented verdict from a jury so the family can move the girl back to California, where doctors would be compelled to care for her.\u000a\u000aBruce Brusavich, a lawyer representing the family in the malpractice case, didn't return a phone message Thursday seeking comment. A lawyer for the hospital, Thomas Still, didn't return a phone call.\u000a\u000aHospital lawyers have argued that the family has not subjected Jahi to tests accepted by the American Medical Association to determine whether someone is brain dead.\u000a\u000aDolan argues that technological advances such as brain scans have made obsolete traditional tests that doctors rely on to diagnose brain death.\u000a\u000aJahi's case reignited the debate over brain death 15 years after the family of Terry Schiavo fought a bitter, drawn-out legal battle starting in 1998 over whether to remove the Florida woman's feeding tube.\u000a\u000aIn Jahi's case, her mother acknowledges that the girl's brain is severely and irreparably damaged, Dolan said. But Latasha Spears Winkfield said her daughter is still alive and her Christian beliefs compel her fight to keep her daughter on life support, Dolan said.\u000a\u000aWinkfield has released video clips of Jahi's fingers twitching and toes wiggling. Several doctors, including two hired by a California court, have said brain-dead patients can still twitch and move slightly.\u000a\u000aCourt records show that New Jersey's Medicaid program has picked up some of the girl's health costs. The family also has received financial contributions from an online fundraising campaign.\u000a\u000aIn ordering the case to trial, Alameda County Judge Stephen Pulido relied on the testimony of a well-known critic of the way experts diagnose brain death, Dr. Alan Shewmon.\u000a\u000aThe retired neurologist said in court documents filed in July that videos recorded by McMath's family from 2014 to 2016 showed the teen was still alive.\u000a\u000aThe images, some made public by the girl's relatives, show Jahi twitching her fingers and reacting to odors that Shewmon and her relatives said were noxious without providing more specifics. Shewmon said Jahi's body has not deteriorated as expected.\u000a\u000aA doctor who examines the girl every three months for the family has testified that Jahi had reached puberty. Shewmon says Jahi is in a "minimally responsive state."

aVBy Gregg Jarrett, Fox News\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton has always been adept at blaming everyone but herself. Her soon to be published memoir of the 2016 presidential election is no exception.\u000a\u000aIt's officially called \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d Based on the excerpts reviewed so far, it bears little resemblance to what happened.\u000a\u000aI can only imagine the conversation that led to the publisher\u2019s selection of such a beguiling title.\u000a\u000aPublisher: Hillary\u2026 we need to come up with a shorter title to your book.\u000a\u000aHillary: What\u2019s wrong with, \u201cI Lost The Presidency Because of Sexism, The Media, Russians, Comey, Racism, Xenophobia, The Democratic National Committee, Misogyny, Obama, Biden, Sanders, Wikileaks, The Electoral College, And Polling Data\u201d?\u000a\u000aPublisher: Well, for one thing\u2026 it won\u2019t fit on the cover.\u000a\u000aHillary: You wouldn\u2019t say that if I\u2019d won. You\u2019re victimizing me because I lost. And you\u2019re just like Trump, literally breathing down my neck and making my skin crawl. Back up you creep.\u000a\u000aPublisher: Uh\u2026 I\u2019m sitting across from you at a large table. And while we\u2019re on the subject, our editors think you should delete that whole business about Trump breathing down your neck. It is simply not true. We looked at the debate tape. He never stalked you on stage. We think you\u2019ve confused reality with the "Saturday Night Live" skit.

aVBy Howard Kurtz, FOX NEWS\u000a\u000aMany Republicans are shocked that President Trump did a budget deal with the Democrats, opting for \u201cChuck and Nancy\u201d in an Oval Office meeting over Paul and Mitch.\u000a\u000aThey shouldn\u2019t be.\u000a\u000aWhether the three-month debt ceiling agreement is a fleeting political maneuver or a presidential hammer against his own party, it\u2019s not terribly surprising. Trump has been increasingly frustrated with McConnell and Ryan for failing to pass much of anything since he took office. So he struck a deal with Schumer and Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThe move underscores what I\u2019ve always maintained about Donald Trump, that he\u2019s basically an independent president. He\u2019s a onetime Democrat who vanquished the Republican establishment, but has never been wedded to GOP orthodoxy.

aVFrom the bestselling team of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard comes Killing Reagan, a page-turning epic account of the career of President Ronald Reagan that tells the vivid story of his rise to power -- and the forces of evil that conspired to bring him down.\u000a\u000aJust two months into his presidency, Ronald Reagan lay near death after a gunman's bullet came within inches of his heart. His recovery was nothing short of remarkable -- or so it seemed. But Reagan was grievously injured, forcing him to encounter a challenge that few men ever face. Could he silently overcome his traumatic experience while at the same time carrying out the duties of the most powerful man in the world?\u000a\u000aTold in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton, Killing Reagan reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in the California governor's mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan's most heroic actions. In Killing Reagan, O'Reilly and Dugard take readers behind the scenes, creating an unforgettable portrait of a great man operating in violent times.

aVThirty years ago a brash developer named Donald J. Trump exploded onto the national scene with his No. 1 bestseller, \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal.\u201d Now that he is in the White House making successful deals on behalf of the American people, he is proving to be a far more effective leader than establishment politicians like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u000a\u000aEmanuel, who should write his own tome and title it \u201cThe Art of Failure,\u201d has shown himself to be an abysmal dealmaker and leader. So to divert attention for his many failures, he is attacking President Trump. Over and over again.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m a proud Chicagoan. I love the city: its architecture, its culture and my Chicago Bears. But the harsh reality is that Chicago faces a systemic crisis \u2013 beset by failing schools and rampant crime \u2013 all while careening toward a fiscal cliff of insolvency.\u000a\u000aAnd don\u2019t take my word for it. People are voting with their feet as Chicago is the only major American metropolitan area to lose population in both 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aBut of course, Emanuel paints a very different picture. Instead of coming clean about his own failings or figuring out how to do his job, he\u2019d rather spend his time attacking President Trump.\u000a\u000aAddressing illegal immigrant students protected under an executive order issued in 2012 by President Obama, which President Trump is phasing out over six months, Emanuel sermonized recently: \u201cChicago, our schools, our neighborhoods, our city as it relates to what President Trump said will be a Trump-free zone. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile President Trump is ending the 2012 executive order because it is unconstitutional, he is asking Congress to pass legislation reforming our immigration laws in the next six months. That\u2019s how to solve a problem.\u000a\u000aEmanuel has been attacking the president for months, particularly when it comes to Chicago\u2019s failing public schools.\u000a\u000aResponding the president\u2019s justified criticism of the poor job Chicago schools are doing for students, Emanuel said back in April: \u201cNow, the president of the United States is allowed to have fake news, but the facts are the facts about the city of Chicago,\u201d and bragged about progress the schools have made since he became mayor. Emanuel demanded that the president stop \u201crunning down\u201d schools in Chicago.\u000a\u000aCalling Chicago schools a giant failure is \u201cfake news?\u201d Hardly.\u000a\u000aNot only are Chicago\u2019s schools \u201cTrump-free,\u201d they are also learning-free for most students. According to the baseline PARCC test used by the Illinois State Board of Education, only 25 percent of Chicago students score at \u201cready for the next level\u201d to advance to the next grade. Think about that \u2013 75 percent of students are not getting the education they deserve!\u000a\u000aBut of course, the school district promotes students to the next grade whether they are ready or not, largely to hide the fact that it has failed to properly educate them. If you don\u2019t like the score, just move the goalposts.\u000a\u000aNo wonder, then, that among those students who do graduate from high school \u2013 still under 70 percent \u2013 only 30 percent are deemed \u201ccollege ready\u201d according to ACT scores. Among Chicago community college enrollees, fully 70 percent require remedial classes to address their academic deficiencies.\u000a\u000aAnd sadly and unsurprisingly, only 14 percent of Chicago Public School 9th graders will eventually graduate from college.\u000a\u000aWhile Emanuel focuses on shielding Chicago students from Trump, his school system excels at shielding them from success. The ramifications, naturally, flow into adulthood. A University of Illinois study found that 47 percent of black men in the city ages 20 to 24 are neither in school nor employed. What a tragedy and waste of their potential.\u000a\u000aAnd that tragedy, of course, is not merely confined to the these young people, but to the city at large as violent crime spirals out of control in Chicago, now very likely the most dangerous city in the entire developed world.\u000a\u000aWhile our mayor purports that \u201cyou have nothing to worry about,\u201d the sobering truth is that children in large swaths of the city cannot even play safely in the park. Over 2,600 people have been shot so far in 2017 in Chicago, including 447 who were killed.\u000a\u000aIf this carnage represents \u201cnothing to worry about,\u201d then I cannot imagine the mayhem once the violence becomes worrisome!\u000a\u000aMayor Emanuel should forgo the grandstanding and the politics of diversion. He should stop scapegoating our president and start healing and repairing his once-great American city.\u000a\u000aSteve Cortes is a Fox News contributor, former Trump campaign operative and spokesman for the Hispanic 100. For two decades, he worked on Wall Street as a trader and strategist.

aVNarratives surrounding the DNC hack & Antifa reveal media bias and government bureaucracy at their worst.\u000a\u000aBy Victor Davis Hanson, the National Review\u000a\u000aU.S. intelligence agencies said Russia was responsible for hacking Democratic National Committee e-mail accounts, leading to the publication of about 20,000 stolen e-mails on WikiLeaks.\u000a\u000aBut that finding was reportedly based largely on the DNC\u2019s strange outsourcing of the investigation to a private cybersecurity firm. Rarely does the victim of a crime first hire a private investigator whose findings later form the basis of government conclusions.\u000a\u000aWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is many things. But so far he has not been caught lying about the origin of the leaked documents that came into his hands. He has insisted for well over a year that the Russians did not provide him with the DNC e-mails.\u000a\u000aWhen it was discovered that the e-mails had been compromised, then\u2013DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz weirdly refused to allow forensic detectives from the FBI to examine the DNC server to probe the evidence of the theft. Why did the FBI accept that refusal?
