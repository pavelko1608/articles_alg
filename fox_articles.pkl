VBy Christian Toto, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf\u2019s Trump hate save his career? The Transformers star is in big trouble. Again. Could his ardent hate for President Trump help him bounce back?\u000a\u000aMel Gibson couldn\u2019t get arrested in Hollywood following his oh, so famous public meltdown in 2006.\u000a\u000aThe Lethal Weapon star ranted against the Jews while being cuffed on DUI charges. It took years for Gibson to get in the industry\u2019s good graces again. He apologized repeatedly, kept a low profile and performed in some indie films before winning raves for his 2016 war film Hacksaw Ridge.\u000a\u000aWill Shia LaBeouf follow in Gibson\u2019s tainted footsteps? Or will the actor\u2019s anti-Trump performance art buffer him against a similar career catastrophe?

aVBarbara Cook, whose shimmering soprano made her one of Broadway's leading ingenues and later a major cabaret and concert interpreter of popular American song, has died. She was 89.\u000a\u000aCook died early Tuesday of respiratory failure at her home in Manhattan, surrounded by family and friends, according to publicist Amanda Kaus. Her last meal was vanilla ice cream.\u000a\u000aThroughout her nearly six decades on stage, Cook's voice remained remarkably supple, gaining in emotional honesty and expanding on its natural ability to go straight to the heart.\u000a\u000aOn Broadway, Cook was best known for three roles: her portrayal of the saucy Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein's "Candide" (1956); librarian Marian opposite Robert Preston in "The Music Man" (1957); and Amalia Balash, the letter-writing heroine of "She Loves Me" (1963).\u000a\u000aYet when Cook's pert ingenue days were over, she found a second, longer career in clubs and concert halls, working for more than 30 years with Wally Harper, a pianist and music arranger. Harper helped in shaping her material, choosing songs and providing the framework for her shows.\u000a\u000aTo celebrate her 80th birthday, she appeared with the New York Philharmonic in two concerts in November 2007 and then had a similar birthday salute in London. In 2011, she was saluted at the Kennedy Center Honors and remained a singer even in her 80s.\u000a\u000a"Of course, I think I've gotten better at it," she said in an interview with The Associated Press in her Manhattan home in 2011. "I still think this is a work in progress. I do. Seriously. As the years go by, I have more and more courage to go deeper and deeper and deeper."\u000a\u000aBorn in Atlanta in 1927, Cook always hated vocal exercises, never had a vocal coach and had an effortless skill of creating beauty by just opening her mouth. "I don't remember when I didn't sing. I just always sang," she said in 2011. "I think I breathed and I sang."\u000a\u000aHer father was a traveling salesman who sold hats; her mother worked for Southern Bell. Her baby sister died of pneumonia when she was 3 and her father left when she was 6. She was raised by her far-too-clingy mother, who blamed young Barbara for both the death and the abandonment.\u000a\u000aCook made her Broadway debut in "Flahooley" (1951), a short-lived musical fantasy about a mass-produced laughing doll. The show became a cult classic for musical-theater buffs, primarily because it was recorded, keeping its memory alive long after the production closed.\u000a\u000aCook then appeared in a pair of Rodgers and Hammerstein classics, playing Ado Annie in a City Center revival of "Oklahoma!" and then on tour in 1953. She followed that by portraying Carrie Pipperidge in a 1954 revival of "Carousel." It led to Cook's first original musical success, a yearlong Broadway run in "Plain and Fancy" (1955), in which she portrayed an innocent, unworldly Amish girl.\u000a\u000aThe following year, she starred in "Candide," which ran only 73 performances but later became a staple of opera houses around the world. In the musical, Cook got to sing "Glitter and Be Gay," a fiendishly difficult coloratura parody of the "Jewel Song" from Charles Gounod's "Faust."\u000a\u000aMeredith Willson's "The Music Man" was Cook's biggest Broadway hit, opening in December 1957 and running for more than 1,300 performances. She won a Tony Award for her portrayal of the prim librarian who realizes Professor Harold Hill (Preston) is a con man selling band instruments and uniforms to the gullible residents of a small Iowa town.\u000a\u000aCook scored a personal triumph in "She Loves Me," a Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick-Joe Masteroff musical based on the film "The Shop Around the Corner." It told of two squabbling employees in a Budapest perfume shop who, unknown to each other, are romantically inclined pen pals. In the show, Cook sang a number extolling a gift of "Vanilla Ice Cream," which became a signature number for the performer when she began appearing in cabaret.\u000a\u000aThat turn began after her Broadway career withered in the late 1960s as Cook battled alcoholism and weight gain. In her 2016 memoir "Then & Now," Cook describes hitting rock bottom as a drunk: "I was so broke that I was stealing food from the supermarket by slipping sandwich meat in my coat pocket."\u000a\u000aBut she gave up drinking in the 1970s and, with the help of Harper, reinvented herself as a solo artist, working in small New York clubs and finally Carnegie Hall. Her first concert album, "Barbara Cook at Carnegie Hall" (1975), became a classic.\u000a\u000aCook and Harper, who died in 2004, worked methodically and carefully on her shows, mixing show tunes with standards not from musical theater. Often the programs were constructed around themes, specific composers such as Stephen Sondheim, lyricists such as Dorothy Fields, or directors such as Harold Prince and Gower Champion.\u000a\u000aSondheim became one of her biggest champions. Cook starred, along with Lee Remick, Mandy Patinkin and George Hearn, in a legendary 1985 concert version of "Follies" at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall.\u000a\u000aAnd Cook was equally celebratory of Sondheim's work. In "Mostly Sondheim," her critically acclaimed revue of songs by the composer, the singer interspersed his own compositions with numbers he admires \u2014 everything from Harold Arlen tearjerkers to the earthy, jazz-flecked "Hard-Hearted Hannah."\u000a\u000aAmong Cook's other Broadway musicals were "The Gay Life" (1961), "Something More!" (1964) and "The Grass Harp" (1971), based on the Truman Capote novel. She also appeared in several plays on Broadway, most notably "Any Wednesday" in 1965 (as one of Sandy Dennis' replacements), Jules Feiffer's "Little Murders" (1967) and Maxim Gorky's "Enemies" with the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center in 1972.\u000a\u000aHer marriage to acting teacher David LeGrant ended in divorce. Cook is survived by a son, Adam LeGrant.\u000a\u000aWhen asked what her advice usually was to aspiring singers, she said it boiled down to three words that she learned early on herself and have been her guide.\u000a\u000a"You are enough. You are always enough. You don't ever have to pretend to be anything other than what you are. All you have to do is deeply embrace who you are and you'll be fine," she said. "In life, aren't you drawn to the more authentic people? Of course. You're not drawn to phonies."

aVProgressive corporations enforce an ideological monoculture. Dissent and get fired.\u000a\u000aBy David French, The National Review\u000a\u000aWhen I talk about free speech, I often ask the audience two questions. First, did you know that the Supreme Court has been steadily expanding free-speech rights? Second, do you feel freer to speak now than you did five years ago? The answers are always the same \u2014 some variation of \u201cno\u201d and \u201check, no.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe first assertion is undoubtedly true. Federal courts have consistently protected free speech from government interference and have been relentless in shutting down viewpoint discrimination. When government officials target speech because of a speaker\u2019s views, they lose time and again.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, millions of Americans are extraordinarily reluctant to express even the most mainstream of (particularly) social conservative views. They\u2019re convinced that if they do that, they\u2019ll be publicly humiliated, investigated, and perhaps even lose their jobs. They\u2019re convinced that outspoken liberals enjoy greater opportunity in key sectors of the economy, and if conservatives want to thrive, they best keep their opinions to themselves.\u000a\u000aTwo recent incidents highlight this concern. The first comes courtesy of actress Lena Dunham, the paradigm of the celebrity social-justice warrior. Early last Thursday morning, she tweeted at American Airlines that she\u2019d heard two of its employees engaged in \u201ctransphobic\u201d talk. Specifically, she said she heard two flight attendants talk about how they thought transgenderism was \u201cgross,\u201d and they\u2019d \u201cnever accept a trans kid.\u201d She did not see them harassing anyone. She was simply eavesdropping on a conversation.

Then she shows us how to overcome these left wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the topics she tackles in the book: (1) How the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom (a new Blackrock survey shows that 4 out of 10 Americans haven't even started saving for retirement)--and how to get it back; (2) How the wide-open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year--and how we can successfully navigate the system; (3)How, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored health-care coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies have begun to abandon employee health-care coverage and opt to pay a less expensive federal penalty; (4) Why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.

aVYou have probably heard the term Old School, but what you might not know is that there is a concentrated effort to tear that school down.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a values thing. The anti\u2013Old School forces believe the traditional way of looking at life is oppressive. Not inclusive. The Old School way may harbor microaggressions. Therefore, Old School philosophy must be diminished.\u000a\u000aThose crusading against Old School now have a name: Snowflakes. You may have seen them on cable TV whining about social injustice and income inequality. You may have heard them cheering Bernie Sanders as he suggested the government pay for almost everything. The Snowflake movement is proud and loud, and they don\u2019t like Old School grads.\u000a\u000aSo where are you in all this?\u000a\u000aDid you get up this morning knowing there are mountains to climb\u2015and deciding how you are going to climb them? Do you show up on time? Do you still bend over to pick up a penny? If so, you\u2019re Old School.\u000a\u000aOr did you wake up whining about safe spaces and trigger warnings? Do you feel marginalized by your college\u2019s mascot? Do you look for something to get outraged about, every single day, so you can fire off a tweet defending your exquisitely precious sensibilities? Then you\u2019re a Snowflake.\u000a\u000aSo again, are you drifting frozen precipitation? Or do you matriculate at the Old School fountain of wisdom?\u000a\u000aThis book will explain the looming confrontation so even the ladies on The View can understand it.\u000a\u000aTime to take a stand. Old School or Snowflake. Which will it be?

aVIran signed the country's biggest-ever car deal on Monday to build tens of thousands of cars annually under a joint venture with French automobile manufacturer Groupe Renault, buoying its manufacturing industry in defiance of the Trump administration's moves to isolate the country.\u000a\u000aThe \u20ac660 million \u2014 or $778 million \u2014 deal follows the lifting of the U.N. and European Union sanctions after Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers to curb its controversial uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aIt also comes just days after new U.S. sanctions on Iran were signed by President Donald Trump, who spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend about ways to counter Iran's influence in Mideast conflicts. The U.S. legislation, first passed by Congress, imposes penalties on people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them.\u000a\u000aAmerican businesses have been cautious about pursuing business deals with Iran due to U.S. sanctions in place not related to the nuclear program.\u000a\u000aAsian and European companies, meanwhile, have raced for a share of Iran's sizable consumer market since international sanctions were lifted. Iran, with its population of 80 million people, sits atop the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and the second-biggest reserves of natural gas. It also has well-established manufacturing and agricultural industries.\u000a\u000aJust last month, France Total SA and state-run China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $5 billion agreement with Iran to develop the country's massive offshore natural gas field in the first such deal since the landmark nuclear deal was struck. Also, Washington granted permission to Chicago-based Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars' worth of aircraft to Iran in September 2016.\u000a\u000aRenault and other European companies are looking to rebuild their presence in Iran following the lifting of international sanctions. Renault says that in the first half of 2017, its sales in Iran increased by more than 100 percent to 68,365 vehicles \u2014 a nearly 10 percent market share.\u000a\u000aThe new deal, first reached with Iran's government last September, will see Renault produce 150,000 vehicles a year in Iran at a plant located 120 kilometers (75 miles) outside Tehran. The plant will produce Duster and Symbol cars starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aRenault, a majority shareholder with a 60 percent share in the deal, will have its own distribution network in Iran for the first time. The company has been operating in Iran since 2003, though operations were halted when Iran came under international sanctions over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aDuring the signing ceremony in Tehran, Iran's Minister of Industry Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said the deal with Renault would "establish a research and development center for designing" in the country.\u000a\u000aA Renault executive, Thierry Bolloré, said it would help transfer technology to Iran and reinforce Groupe Renault's position there.\u000a\u000a"This joint venture will enable an acceleration of our growth in this country," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe car deal is expected to create about 3,000 jobs for the two Iranian companies involved: IDRO, or the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization of Iran, and the privately-owned Negin Group, which imports Renault products to Iran.\u000a\u000aAlso last year, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen reached a deal to open a plant producing 200,000 vehicles annually in Iran. Peugeot was a major player in Iran's car market before international sanctions were imposed.\u000a\u000aIran produces about 1,350,000 vehicles a year, though authorities hope that number will reach 3 million annually by 2025. There are around 30 car manufacturers in Iran, most of which assemble Chinese and Korean cars in Iran.

But his treatment involved a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a natural resistance to HIV, which is risky and impractical due to the large number of patients already infected.\u000a\u000aWhat's hopeful about the girl's case, is that she is the third child to enter long remission after beginning aggressive treatment soon after infection. She started when she was two and stopped 40 weeks later. Tests found the virus was not capable of reproducing in her immune system cells.\u000a\u000aFor more on this story, check FOXNewsHealth.com.\u000a\u000aHousecall for Health, I'm Alex Hein, FOX News.

aVThe Russia investigation being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is beyond corrupt, beyond political and has now turned into an open-ended fishing expedition.\u000a\u000aRosenstein, who like Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has glaring, inexcusable conflicts of interest in the case, insisted to Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace that he will keep Mueller from expanding his s not on a witch hunt.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he finds evidence of a crime that's within in the scope of what Director Mueller and I have agreed is the appropriate scope of this investigation, then he can,\u201d Rosenstein said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIf it's something outside that scope, he needs to come to the acting attorney general, at this time me, for permission to expand his investigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aRosenstein says he won\u2019t let the special counsel turn into a fishing expedition? It already has. The whole investigation was supposed to be about President Trump\u2019s campaign supposedly colluding with the Russians. This has gone on 11 months, no smoking gun proving it ever surfaced.\u000a\u000aYet, instead of ending it there, Mueller is reportedly now looking into the finances of President Trump and the Trump Organization and associates of President Trump. He has impaneled a grand jury in Washington, D.C., where the president got a little over four percent of the vote.\u000a\u000aWhat Rosenstein really said was that he has now given Mueller the green light to do whatever he wants. Even respected legal scholar Jonathan Turley, a Democrat, has said Rosenstein needs to recuse himself.\u000a\u000aAfter all, Rosenstein is likely going to be a witness in the investigation that he himself caused because he took the lead in writing the letter to President Trump on why former FBI Director James Comey should be fired. Mueller reportedly regards that as possible obstruction of justice.\u000a\u000aRosenstein is also the guy who appointed Robert Mueller and apparently either didn't know or didn't care about the fact that the day before he was named special counsel, Mueller interviewed with President Trump for the FBI director\u2019s job. You can't make this up.\u000a\u000aRosenstein has sat by while Mueller, with an unlimited budget, has assembled a team of 16 lawyers. Half have made political donations, shockingly, all to Democrats. How is that OK? If the tables were turned, would a Democrat allow a special counsel to only appoint Republican donors?\u000a\u000aIt all comes down to this: Does Rod Rosenstein know what is going to happen if Mueller's mission creep continues to go unchecked? How does he think voters are going to feel? How many Trump supporters will feel robbed of their right and their vote in the free election of the president of the United States?\u000a\u000aThat would be bad for the country. It would be bad for the system of justice. And it would be bad for anyone who believes in a constitutional republic.\u000a\u000aAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on "Hannity," Aug. 7, 2017\u000a\u000aSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET).

Bill Clinton and Lynch said it was a chance meeting, where family matters were discussed.\u000a\u000aA few days later FBI director James Comey blasted Hillary\u2019s handling of her computers but recommended that she not be charged with any crimes.\u000a\u000aHillary has offered the same nonsensical explanation that Bill used when discussing the tarmac meeting \u2014 the missing emails were only about daughter Chelsea\u2019s wedding. And yoga.\u000a\u000aAgain, that\u2019s the Clintons\u2019 way of saying that Americans are stupid enough to believe anything.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not a big defender of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aBut since the rest of the main stream media is spending all of its time focusing on what Trump and associates might have done in connection with Russia during the campaign I\u2019ve decided to tell you stories that the Times and Washington Post and almost all the other networks have decided to ignore.\u000a\u000aI started in my last column by explaining the terrorism threats that Washington is really focused on.

aVLoretta Lynch used the alias \u201cElizabeth Carlisle\u201d for official emails as attorney general, including those related to her infamous tarmac meeting last summer with former President Clinton.\u000a\u000aThe emails were included in 413 pages of Justice Department documents provided to conservative watchdog groups Judicial Watch and American Center for Law and Justice.\u000a\u000aTop federal officials using email aliases is not illegal or new, considering others in the former Obama administration also used them, arguing security concerns and spam to their official email addresses swamping their in-boxes.\u000a\u000aEric Holder, Lynch\u2019s predecessor, used \u201cLew Alcindor,\u201d the former name of retired NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\u000a\u000aHowever, critics of the practice argue that such aliases can result in some requested emails to and from officials going undetected.\u000a\u000aLynch used the alias to help craft responses to media requests about the meeting, the documents show.\u000a\u000aAnd former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was at the center of the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, also used an alias -- Toby Miles.\u000a\u000aInternet sleuths say Elizabeth Carlisle is the birth name of Lynch\u2019s maternal grandmother. But an actress who has done a number of sultry roles -- including \u201cprostitute\u201d and \u201ctipsy\u201d -- also has that name.\u000a\u000aThe Lynch documents were provided to the groups in connection with lawsuits seeking information about the June 27, 2016, meeting on the tarmac of a Phoenix airport.\u000a\u000aThe meeting came amid an FBI investigation into whether Clinton\u2019s wife, then the Democratic presidential nominee, had revealed classified information when using private email servers while secretary of state.\u000a\u000aAbout a week later, FBI Director James Comey concluded the case by saying Clinton was \u201cextremely careless,\u201d but recommended the Justice Department not pursue criminal charges.\u000a\u000aIn Senate testimony earlier this year, Comey said the meeting was a "deciding factor" in his decision to act alone to update the public on the investigation.\u000a\u000aHe also said Lynch had directed him to call the investigation \u201ca matter,\u201d which \u201cconfused\u201d him.\u000a\u000aThe former president left his private plane and boarded Lynch\u2019s uninvited. Lynch said in the aftermath that they talked about grandchildren and other matters, but that the investigation was not discussed.\u000a\u000aHowever, Lynch later said she \u201cregrets\u201d having allowed the meeting.\u000a\u000aLynch\u2019s attorney Robert Raben on Monday told The Daily Caller that Justice Department staffers who process Freedom of Information Act requests are aware of the alias.\u000a\u000aHe also said the agency acknowledged in February 2016 that Lynch was using the Elizabeth Carlisle alias.

We were invited by one of our directors to hunt turtle doves. There were five of us in all and each had a 12-gauge shotgun.\u000a\u000a"Instructions were: Only shoot straight and up; shotgun point in air resting on shoulders when not being used. That's it. I was on the far left, and the fellow on the other end was a Syrian.\u000a\u000a"Well, we were out there and no straggling turtle doves were migrating. A half-hour later, not one shot was fired. Then, two birds from a tree ahead darted out, between me and the houses on my left.\u000a\u000a"We all looked, but the Syrian turned toward us and began shooting over our heads at the birds. The rest of us hit the ground. Even though our host took his gun away, I gave them mine and went back because, if there is a way to overreact, the Syrian would think it is natural and can't even consider the consequences.\u000a\u000a"You cannot place these people in a position of authority (for example with a gun in their hands). They will always shoot as a default reaction to anything that is instant. Neither training nor thinking can change their natures.\u000a\u000a"And that is why he shot.

aVBy Jay Maxon, Newsbusters.org\u000a\u000aStill unsigned football free agent, Colin Kaepernick has a new apologist -- a law professor and Islamaphobia researcher. One of the most outlandish and indefensible attacks on the NFL comes in an error-filled diatribe by Khaled Beydoun, a law professor at the Universit of Detroit Mercy and also a senior affiliated faculty with the University of California-Berkeley Islmaophobia Research and Documentation Project.\u000a\u000aFor a law professor, Beydoun displays serious problems with legal terms and accuracy, all demonstrated in his hit piece carried on the America-hating Al Jazeera website.\u000a\u000aThe professor repeatedly states that Kaepernick has been blackballed by the NFL. It was, he claims, punishment for his "condemnation of white supremacy." The word "blackball" is defined as "to vote against, especially to veto the admission of," and "to shut out from social or commercial participation; ostracize or boycott." There is no boycott of Kaepernick, and there is no organized league effort to silence him or keep him out of the league.

aVA nerve-rattling encounter with a mountain lion started with a fleeting glimpse of the big cat's tail on a High Sierra trail in California's wilderness.\u000a\u000aBrian McKinney didn't believe it was a puma that his hiking partner Sam Vonderheide had seen, so he got out his phone and hit record as they followed the lithe creature.\u000a\u000aThe hikers slowly rounded a turn to see it peering down on them from a rocky perch just feet away.\u000a\u000aIts ears were perked up, head cocked and eyes locked on them.\u000a\u000a"What are you supposed to do?" one hiker whispered. The other answered: "I don't know. I don't think you're supposed to run."\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aMcKinney said his heart races now seeing the video.\u000a\u000a"(I was) not only shocked, but alarmed that she had the advantage above me, which is what they do when they hunt," he said.\u000a\u000aRangers at Sequoia National Park on Monday posted link to the two-minute video captured July 23.\u000a\u000aThe clip ends with the hikers slowly backing away. But they said the encounter didn't end there.\u000a\u000aThey waited for the cat to leave and tried rousing it from the trail, so they could continue on to the place they wanted to set up camp. The lion didn't budge.\u000a\u000a"She just looked at us like she was entertained," he said. "So we gave up."\u000a\u000aThe two hikers then turned back and set up camp for a restless night's sleep in another area, their first of a nearly two-week-long hike up Mount Whitney, armed with only an ice ax and a bear whistle.\u000a\u000aThe next day, they had to cross the path where they had the encounter.\u000a\u000aThe men were so shaken they had made goodbye videos for their loved ones. Vonderheide was armed with the ice ax, but the only traces they found of the mountain lion were the paw marks it left behind.\u000a\u000aWildlife biologist Daniel Gammons said the men did the right thing by staying calm. Biologists say you should make yourself appear big by waving your arms overhead and scare off the animal, as the men did.\u000a\u000a"The big thing these visitors did right was that they didn't panic and run," Gammons said. "Probably the most important message to get out to visitors is not to act like prey if they encounter a mountain lion."\u000a\u000aWhile the encounter was terrifying, McKinney said he and Vonderheide had discussed spotting a puma.\u000a\u000a"When we started the trip, we sort of jokingly said, 'Wouldn't it be great if we saw the trifecta of a rattlesnake, a bear and a mountain lion?' " he said. "And sure enough, we got our wish."

aVWhen retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly was sworn in as White House chief of staff last week, he took command of a Trump administration that now has more military commanders in top spots than any since Eisenhower's.\u000a\u000aThe generals hand-picked by Trump -- Kelly, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary James Mattis -- share a penchant for passing their opinions up the chain of command in the bluntest of terms. Their prominence in the administration belies the common perception the commander in chief prefers to be surounded by yes men.\u000a\u000a\u201cJim Mattis defines \u2018speaking truth to power\u2019 in my view, and I like to think I do as well,\u201d said Kelly, speaking exclusively with Fox News in his first interview since becoming chief of staff. \u201cI observed him do it routinely -- every day -- as we planned the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath.\u201d\u000a\u000a" ... telling the unvarnished truth to power doesn't mean you always get your way.\u201d - Gen. John Kelly\u000a\u000aA fourth general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, is a holdover from the prior administration yet shares many of the same qualities that have endeared other high-ranking military men to Trump.\u000a\u000aKelly had already earned Trump's approval by serving as Homeland Security secretary during the first six months of his administration. His no-nonsense pursuit of Trump's agenda on immigration and terrorism prompted Trump to brand him a "star," and tap him to succeed Reince Priebus as chief of staff. The job, which has traditionally been the domain of civilian leadership, makes Kelly the president's top adviser.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aMattis, who famously said he devises a contingency plan to kill everyone he meets, required an act of Congress to get the job, since he hadn\u2019t been out of the military long enough when he was appointed to his role. Once he got the waiver, he breezed through confirmation by an 81-17 vote.\u000a\u000a"He\u2019s a humble man with very little to be humble about," William Cohen, who served as President Clinton's Pentagon secretary, said of Mattis.\u000a\u000aThe careers of all four men have intersected over the years. Kelly, Mattis and Dunford came up through the Marines and all are in their 60s. McMaster is younger, at 55, and came up through the Army. Yet all have made their reputations on both the battlefield and, in recent decades, the Pentagon boardroom.\u000a\u000aKelly was a captain in the 4th Marine Expeditionary Unit when he first met then-Lt. Col. Mattis in the Persian Gulf War, \u201cbut really got to know him right after 9/11 when I became his assistant division commander in the 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, California.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was the summer of 2002. The two Marines then deployed to Kuwait later that year, and lived together in the desert until the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq started in March 2003. After leading a column into Baghdad, Kelly and Mattis led Marines in the intense combat over Al-Anbar province which went into full-scale revolt in 2004.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, then-Army Capt. McMaster earned a Silver Star from the Battle of 73 Easting in Operation Desert Storm, when his heavily outnumbered armored unit destroyed 28 Iraqi Republican Guard tanks without loss in 23 minutes.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, once described as a \u201cblunt-spoken bulldog of a man,\u201d was passed over for promotion to brigadier general twice for \u201cmaking too many enemies to rise past the rank of colonel\u201d before getting his first star. He replaced another general favored by Trump, Mike Flynn, as national security adviser and has continued to ruffle feathers \u2013 on the right and left.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a\u201cRegarding H.R., I heard of him first when I read his superb book \u2018Dereliction of Duty,\u2019\u201d said Kelly, referring to McMaster\u2019s seminal work in which he argued that the Vietnam War was lost because military leaders should have more openly voiced their opposition to the Johnson administration\u2019s policy of gradualism.\u000a\u000a\u201cNever really got to know him very well until he joined the administration,\u201d Kelly said. "[But] every day I see him speak truth to power to me in my current position.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the generals have taken command of the West Wing, including reportedly limiting who the President can see and what he can read, all three have come under intense scrutiny by both right and left.\u000a\u000aMichele Flournoy, said to be in the running for Secretary of Defense had Hillary Clinton won the election, worried that \u201cputting too many former senior general officers into civilian positions can be cause for concern in a democracy where we pride ourselves on civilian control.\u201d\u000a\u000aA top-level Washington government executive said recently about the widely-respected members of President Trump\u2019s administration, \u201cwhy would they risk their careers to be around such a man?\u201d\u000a\u000aThat criticism was echoed by Cohen in an interview with Politico.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe larger point is, whether it\u2019s Kelly, Mattis or McMaster, you can spend a lifetime building credibility, and lose it overnight,\u201d Cohen said.\u000a\u000aMcMaster, meanwhile, has come under fire from right-wing allies of White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon -- himself a former Navy lieutenant -- for working for a think-tank that was funded by George Soros, the billionaire financier of leftist causes.\u000a\u000aWith a president caught between a Bannon wing focused on domestic priorities and a military wing focused on winning wars, Kelly said he\u2019s aware that the responsibility of the three generals is to advise, not command, inside the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cRemember, telling the unvarnished truth to power doesn't mean you always get your way,\u201d Kelly told Fox News. "The principal ultimately decides and it is our way that so long as that decision is legal, moral, and ethical, one salutes and executes. Sometimes you win and sometimes you don't.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aA close examination of the three generals closest to Trump shows each brings a slightly different toolkit to addressing the same problems they see in generally the same frame: years of neglect of the military and America\u2019s national security obligations, as well as an awareness that as American culture proceeds down a path of progressivism military culture, in their views, must remain deeply conservative to stay effective in a world of rapidly evolving threats, not to mention the longest run conflicts in American history.\u000a\u000aBoth Mattis and Kelly worried that social changes during the Obama administration, such as allowing transgender people to serve and bringing women into combat roles, were hurting so-called battlefield lethality, or the ability of America\u2019s military to win wars with the fewest number of casualties, on both sides.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the only filter we should ever look through,\u201d Kelly told Fox News in a prior interview late last year. \u201cWhether it's buying a new jet fighter, a new tool -- or any of the social changes. The only thing we should do is ask, \u2018does it make us more lethal on the battlefield?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aKelly said \u201cmany of the changes\u201d undertaken by the Obama administration, \u201cparticularly the social changes, are not very wise.\u201d\u000a\u000aMattis, who rarely does interviews, was reportedly pushed out during the Obama administration because his abrasive nature rubbed some Pentagon insiders the wrong way.\u000a\u000aIn a book co-authored with former Bush national security official Kori Schake, \u2018Warriors & Citizens,\u2019 Mattis wrote that as for \u201cthe inclusion of women in the infantry, and allowing homosexuals and transgender people to serve openly in America\u2019s military forces\u2026 the public may perceive them as civil rights issues; the military by and large does not.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s because, as Schake explained in an interview with Fox News, that while America\u2019s civilian society values diversity and inclusion, \u201clightning strikes of great ideas are not the metric of success of a military unit. Unit cohesion and battlefield lethality are the measures of success of military units. And that is a perspective many civilians lose sight of.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcMaster has been criticized for working for a think-tank that supported President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. But McMaster\u2019s comments when he was active duty with a top strategic planning unit in the Army show he\u2019s anything but an apologist for America\u2019s enemies \u2013 including Iran.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is required is forward deterrence,\u201d McMaster said last year. \u201cConvincing your enemy that your enemy is unable to accomplish his objectives at a reasonable cost -- rather than sort of an offshore balancing approach\u2026 which we know obviously from recent experience confirms is inadequate.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn fact, McMaster, Kelly and Mattis all seem united in their criticism of civilian encroachment on military affairs.\u000a\u000aIn a celebrated Veteran\u2019s Day address to Georgetown University in 2014, McMaster told students that the \u201cwarrior ethos\u201d is at \u201crisk\u201d for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to a \u201ccoarsening\u201d popular culture, fewer Americans are \u201cconnected\u201d to the military, and \u201cfewer and fewer Americans understand what is at stake in the wars in which we are engaged.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s all the more important today that we hold to our precious legacy of ferocious, ethical combat performance,\u201d said Mattis in a 2014 speech. \u201cFor in a world awash in change, Americans need to have confidence in the everlasting character of our Marines.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump has said he wished he served in the military himself, and is very proud of going to the New York Military Academy, 20 minutes from West Point, for high school.\u000a\u000aAs Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. told Fox News last year, \u201cmy father raves about military school. He often says it's the best thing that ever happened to him. It gave him a lotta discipline.\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch sentiments could explain why Trump has turned to the military to bring discipline to a White House awash in leaks and palace intrigue, and to bring a reasoned focus to a world rife with threats, sensing weakness and decline in the world\u2019s only superpower.\u000a\u000aTrump's generals are ready for battle.

aV\u201cFit mom\u201d Maria Kang is calling out plus-size model Tess Holliday over a disagreement about body positivity.\u000a\u000aKang is a fitness blogger and mother of three best known for her \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse\u201d viral Facebook post in 2013, which showed off her toned body just eight months after giving birth to her third son. The post has been widely accused of mom-shaming and setting unrealistic body-image expectations. Since then, Kang\u2019s made a career out of promoting exercise and health as a priority, despite the challenges of being a busy mom, wife and business owner.\u000a\u000aSo when Holliday criticized a man named Robbie Tripp for his viral Instagram post, which celebrates his wife\u2019s curvy body, Kang couldn\u2019t help but disagree.\u000a\u000a|| I love this woman and her curvy body. As a teenager, I was often teased by my friends for my attraction to girls on the thicker side, ones who were shorter and curvier, girls that the average (basic) bro might refer to as "chubby" or even "fat." Then, as I became a man and started to educate myself on issues such as feminism and how the media marginalizes women by portraying a very narrow and very specific standard of beauty (thin, tall, lean) I realized how many men have bought into that lie. For me, there is nothing sexier than this woman right here: thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll, etc. Her shape and size won't be the one featured on the cover of Cosmopolitan but it's the one featured in my life and in my heart. There's nothing sexier to me than a woman who is both curvy and confident; this gorgeous girl I married fills out every inch of her jeans and is still the most beautiful one in the room. Guys, rethink what society has told you that you should desire. A real woman is not a porn star or a bikini mannequin or a movie character. She's real. She has beautiful stretch marks on her hips and cute little dimples on her booty. Girls, don't ever fool yourself by thinking you have to fit a certain mold to be loved and appreciated. There is a guy out there who is going to celebrate you for exactly who you are, someone who will love you like I love my Sarah. || photo cred: @kaileehjudd A post shared by ROBBIE TRIPP\u2122 (@tripp) on Jul 30, 2017 at 6:10pm PDT\u000a\u000aHILARY DUFF TAKES ON BODY SHAMERS BY SHOWING 'CELEB FLAWS'\u000a\u000aHolliday shared her opinion of Tripp\u2019s post on Friday, with a message on social media about the discrepancy between how people react when a man loves a woman with curves as compared to a woman loving herself. \u201cStop giving men trophies for doing the bare minimum,\u201d she captioned her post.\u000a\u000a\U0001f4af\U0001f4af\U0001f4af\U0001f4afThis is so real.

I thought it was a sweet tribute of someone loving their spouse despite any standard. When I see someone like Tess Holliday criticize this, it's disheartening. Tess is an obese model (not thick, plus size or curvy) who has popularized the term #effyourbeautystandards and should promote positivity in all forms,\u201d Kang wrote.\u000a\u000aHer post sparked a heated debate on social media, with comments from people who agree with Holliday\u2019s opinion \u2014 arguing that the man doesn\u2019t deserve praise for loving his wife \u201ceven though\u201d she\u2019s curvy \u2013 and those who thought his \u201cendearing\u201d message was about acceptance.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe should not be praised for loving his wife 'even though' she's not thin. That should be given. He doesn't deserve an award for being so accepting \u2026 she is gorgeous and he's lucky to have her,\u201d one Facebook user commented.\u000a\u000a\u201cProps to this man for supporting and loving his wife regardless of her size, but I sincerely hope that if his \u2018curvy\u2019 wife gets to the point where she's becoming unhealthy and/or obese, that he would encourage her to eat healthier and get moving, not because of the way she looks, but because of the dangers of being grossly overweight,\u201d another person wrote.\u000a\u000aFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\u000a\u000aKang spoke with Yahoo Beauty about the controversial post, elaborating on her opinions.\u000a\u000a\u201cTripp\u2019s post was a sweet tribute to his wife, but we live in a highly sensitive culture where people want to be applauded for self-acceptance rather than accept it from someone else,\u201d Kang tells Yahoo Beauty. \u201cIt seems like Tess believes it\u2019s anti-feminist for a woman to want approval from any man. She has a hard, militant stance regarding outside validation, as symbolized in her #effyourbeautystandards campaign.\u201d Holliday created the celebrated hashtag in 2014 to encourage size acceptance.\u000a\u000aHolliday was not available for comment.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

aVAmazon.com:\u000a\u000aBehind every awful, dangerous decision lurks one evil beast: the Cool.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom politics to the personal, from fashion to food, from the campus to the locker room, the desire to be cool has infected all aspects of our lives. At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale. The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our government\u2014and each day they pass judgment on those who don\u2019t worship at the altar of their coolness. The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people.\u000a\u000aFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool.\u000a\u000aHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that:\u000a\u000a- If you don't agree with them no one will like you.\u000a\u000a- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life.\u000a\u000a- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\u000a\u000aHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Not Cool, Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please. Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a weapon\u2014and one should be armed with it at all times.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aFOX News Insider Preview:\u000a\u000aFox News host and best-selling author Greg Gutfeld will be releasing his new book, \u201cNot Cool: The Hipster Elite and Their War on You\u201d on Tuesday, March 18.\u000a\u000aIn \u201cNot Cool,\u201d Gutfeld, co-host of The Five and star of Red Eye, delves into the theory that America is suffering under the oppression of self-appointed edgy tastemakers \u2013 \u201cthe Cool\u201d \u2013 who are in control of deeming what is good and bad in society. \u200b\u000a\u000aGutfeld gave Fox News Insider an exclusive preview of his new book in the blog below:\u000a\u000aWe often wonder why people do stupid things.\u000a\u000aStupid things that end up ruining your life.\u000a\u000aHow does one become an angry leftist, a destructive activist, or violent radical?\u000a\u000aCan\u2019t they see how wrong they are?\u000a\u000aA person becomes all of those things for reasons we become anything \u2013 to be liked and be accepted. It's natural.\u000a\u000aIn fact, so many things we do - things that are wrong - happen because we want to be liked - we want to be cool.\u000a\u000aI can think of ten things I've done, because I wanted to be cool. And all of them ended badly.\u000a\u000aThe idea that a desire to be liked ends in compromising your values - is not a new idea. But the analysis of its pernicious effect throughout life is a first.\u000a\u000aThe cool's wicked fingers have permeated every nook and cranny of our lives, and harmed many of our once stable institutions. Wherever there is cool, there is weakness - because people become slaves to their insecurity.\u000a\u000aIf you look at relationships, politics, pop culture, the work world, religion, sex, even the military - the desire to be cool leads to an easy subversion of traditional views - because anything that undermines tradition is deemed cool.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, while cool seeks to bring down time-tested traits and behaviors, it offers nothing to replace it with. Except for a glamorous nihilism.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what this book is about.\u000a\u000aHere is more information from the press release:\u000a\u000aSo what is perceived as cool in today\u2019s world that Gutfeld argues is exactly the opposite? Just to name a few:\u000a\u000aDependency as an acceptable lifestyle, independent of achievement. To the Cool there is no shame in letting someone else pay your way (including the government), even if you could pay it yourself.\u000a\u000aRidiculing women, minorities, and gays who reject this culture of dependency and victimization. Don\u2019t hate them because they value capitalism and hard work.\u000a\u000aMovements that reject American values in favor of American guilt. See Occupy Wall Street as one example, rejected by sensible Americans but coddled by the media.\u000a\u000aEvil in film as a lesson plan for a romantic, rebellious reality. Any person, organization, or thing that rebels against structure is heroic, while anyone with a blackberry or briefcase is Hollywood shorthand for evil.\u000a\u000aPolitics is way cool, as long as it\u2019s progressive. Conservatives by nature hate politics and politicians. Liberals love it, because it makes them feel cool.\u000a\u000aHero worship of celebrities based on fake edginess. Johnny Depp is not really a pirate. He\u2019s a walking thrift store lamp. Doesn\u2019t anyone remember when he was just a twerp trashing hotel rooms?\u000a\u000aIn NOT COOL, Gutfeld debunks the phony strategies the Cool use to enslave us and lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool (building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please). NOT COOL fights back against the culture of fakes, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. Entertaining and provocative, it is a guidebook to overcoming the Cool\u2019s authoritarian regime and reemerging free of their chains forever.\u000a\u000aCheck out these links for a list of Gutfeld's tour dates and find out where you can purchase "Not Cool."\u000a\u000aList of appearances: https://www.facebook.com/ggutfeld/events\u000a\u000aBook link: http://ggutfeld.com/books/

aVAudio clip: Listen to audio clip.\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 1942, in the dead of night, eight Nazi saboteurs landed by submarine on the eastern shores of the United States.\u000a\u000aSent by Hitler himself, the invaders planned to blow up industrial targets and spread fear and panic throughout the country. The Nazi dictator intended to strike a second blow to an America still reeling from the attacks at Pearl Harbor just six months earlier. But the U.S. Coast Guard and the FBI uncovered the plot and tracked down the enemy agents. These saboteurs met their fate in a secret military trial that is still controversial to this day.\u000a\u000aThis group of saboteurs was not the first Nazi agents discovered on American soil. In New York in 1941, 44 men and women were arrested as part of a spy ring that sent American military secrets back to Germany. What is shocking about these two episodes of sabotage is that all the men and women working for Hitler lived here in America. They spoke English, worked in American factories and businesses, many were American citizens. Yet they believed in Nazi Germany and many were involved in a sinister pro-Hitler organization based right here in America called the German American Bund.

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

aVBy Harry J. Kazianis, Fox News\u000a\u000aAccording to a newly released survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 75 percent of Americans feel North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is a critical threat facing the United States. And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority. With no silver bullet at the ready to solve what is clearly the ultimate Pandora\u2019s Box\u2014boobytrapped with what can only be described as a nuclear armed fuse\u2014President Trump delivered on a campaign promise to tackle the biggest threats facing America today. With North Korea now six to eighteen months away from building a hydrogen bomb, challenges like ISIS, Russia, the Syrian Civil War or anything else seem to pale in comparison. Just the amount of analysis and news coverage dedicated to the dastardly deeds of Kim Jong Un alone is a win\u2014shining a much-needed spotlight onto a regime that should have been tossed into the scrap heap of history long-ago.

aVSex sells, but is there a limit to how much titillation consumers want?\u000a\u000aChocotravel is a ticketing service based in Kazakhstan that is apparently looking to make a splash with their new app. To their credit, they picked pretty much the most straight-forward way to advertize \u2014 with plenty of skin.\u000a\u000aHowever, the ads have left both the travel industry and consumers shaking their heads.\u000a\u000aThe barely-there wardrobes in the ad were apparently supposed to have a purpose: to highlight the nothing-added fee structure of the company. Yet, the message that was actually communicated was more along the lines of "buy our product because of these attractive ladies."\u000a\u000aIf you're thinking that Chocotravel was just catering to one gender, you would be mistaken, because the company responded to claims of sexism by digging their proverbial hole even further and releasing a second video featuring some men showing \u2014 as they say \u2014 the "Full Monty."\u000a\u000aHere's a pro tip for any companies that might be foolish enough to copy this advertising strategy: If you're looking to get past a charge of sexism, making sure all of your pilots are males and all of your attendants are female isn't the way to do it.\u000a\u000aThe backlash to the company has been fierce thanks to internet comments, and plenty of digital ink has already been spilled on the matter. The company's director isn't convinced the criticisms are correct, however, and has responded via his personal Facebook page, as reported by the BBC.\u000a\u000a"On his Facebook page, Chocotravel Ticketing Service director, Nikolay Mazensev, has responded to the criticism saying the clips were "bold and outrageous and we did not mean to offend."\u000a\u000aHe adds: "It shows no less than you'd see on the beach or by the pool.

aVThese days, the price of a San Francisco home can easily top a million dollars. But one savvy investor has bought up a whole street in the city's most exclusive neighborhood for a mere $90,000.\u000a\u000aTrouble is, some of the extremely wealthy residents of Presidio Terrace were not aware their street was up for sale and are not pleased it has been sold.\u000a\u000aPresidio Terrace is an oval shaped street sealed off by a gate from the tony Presidio Heights neighborhood. Lined with towering palm trees and multimillion dollar mansions, the street has been home, over the years, to famous residents including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aThanks to a city auction stemming from an unpaid tax bill, Bay Area real estate investor Michael Cheng, and his wife Tina Lam, bought the street and now own the sidewalks, the street itself and other areas of "common ground" in the private development that, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, has been managed by the homeowners association since at least 1905.\u000a\u000aCheng says reaction to the sale has been less than neighborly.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a"I thought they would reach out to us and invite us in as new neighbors," Cheng told The Associated Press. "This has certainly blown up a lot more than we expected."\u000a\u000aIt turns out the homeowners association for Presidio Terrace failed to pay a $14-a-year property tax, something that owners of all 181 private streets in San Francisco must do, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aSo the city's tax office put the property up for sale at the cost of $994 in an online auction to regain unpaid back taxes, penalties and interest. The couple eventually won the street with a $90,100 bid in an April 2015 auction.\u000a\u000aScott Emblidge, the attorney for the Presidio Homeowners Association, said in a letter to the city that the owners failed to pay because the tax bill was mistakenly being sent to the address of an accountant who hadn't worked for the homeowners association since the 1980s, the Chronicle reported.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aEmblidge said the residents didn't know their street was put on the auction block, let alone sold, until May when a title search company hired by Cheng and Lam reached out to ask if any residents had interest in buying back the property.\u000a\u000aThat was one of several options Cheng and Lam have considered for making the investment pay off.\u000a\u000aAnother option is to charge residents to park on their street \u2014 and rent out the 120 parking spaces that line the grand circular road.\u000a\u000a"As legal owners of this property, we have a lot of options," Cheng said, adding that nothing has been decided.\u000a\u000aThe matter could be headed for court.\u000a\u000aLast month, the homeowners petitioned the Board of Supervisors for a hearing to rescind the tax sale. The board has scheduled a hearing for October. The homeowners association has also sued the couple and the city, seeking to block Cheng and Lam from selling the street to anyone while the city appeal is pending.

aVThe complex choreography of Saturn's numerous moons displays beautiful physics, but only a few of the worlds may be friendly to life.\u000a\u000aOceans of liquid water, deep beneath the icy crusts of three of Saturn's natural satellites, may satisfy the conditions needed for "life as we know it," scientists say. The small, bright-white Enceladus and Dione, and the giant, orange, haze-enshrouded Titan each probably contain such subsurface seas. But the unique structure and contents of each ocean represent a different possible solution to the life equation.\u000a\u000aThe Cassini-Huygens mission \u2014 a collaboration of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency \u2014 has been a prolific pioneer of Saturn's moons. When the mission launched in 1997, 18 moons were known to orbit the planet, and 13 more were suspected. But the number of confirmed moons now stands at 53, with another nine marked as "conditional." Cassini's data revealed seven entirely unknown moons that are not observable from Earth. [The Rings and Moons of Saturn in Pictures]\u000a\u000aThis elaborate system of moons forms a complex clockwork of gravitational resonances; they perturb one another's orbits and constantly sculpt Saturn's rings. And the massive planet gravitationally disrupts the moons, warming some of them to the point of possibly swaddling life beneath their surfaces.\u000a\u000aThe first hints that something wonderful might be going on beneath the surface of the small moon Enceladus came during the 1981 flyby mission of NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. Enceladus appeared remarkably bright and unusually smooth, with comparatively few craters. This 314-mile-wide (505 kilometers) moon turned out to be the whitest object in the solar system.\u000a\u000aIn 2005, Cassini's magnetometer readings of Enceladus raised researchers' eyebrows: The moon's magnetic signature looked more like that of a comet than that of a typical spherical satellite. The field lines seemed to bend around Enceladus' southern pole. On a pass where Enceladus was seen against the black background of space, Cassini's cameras caught plumes of water emanating from that polar region.\u000a\u000aSeveral Cassini flybys confirmed that the area was about 180 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) warmer than the rest of the moon's surface. The heat source was aligned with four prominent "tiger stripe" features. These turned out to be fissures \u2014 cracks in the icy crust through which geysers shoot water into space at about 800 mph (about 1,300 km/h).\u000a\u000aCassini sailed within 31 miles (50 km) of Enceladus' south pole on March 12, 2008. During that flyby, the probe sampled the plumes, and found that they were made of water laced with ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide. More flybys were planned. By April 2014, it was clear that some of the geyser particles were salty, flavored with potassium and sodium, very similar to Earthly sea spray. Hydrogen gas was detected in the jets, as were silicate crystals, which could only have been formed in boiling water, scientists said. [Photos: Enceladus, Saturn's Cold, Bright Moon]\u000a\u000aThis evidence, taken together, suggests the presence of a salty ocean of liquid water under the ice, in contact with a hot, rocky seafloor through which mineral-laden hot water flows. It is easy to imagine hydrothermal vents there, very similar to the "black smokers" and "white smokers" found on the bottom of Earth's oceans, where they form oases for communities of life.\u000a\u000aEnceladus seems to be begging us to return with instruments capable of detecting amino acids, fatty acids and long-chain carbon molecules \u2014 and perhaps even imaging equipment to photograph any possible microorganisms themselves.\u000a\u000aTitan, which is 10 times wider than Enceladus, is also a world of liquids. But the fluids flowing on Titan's surface are hydrocarbons, not water. At Titan's surface temperature, water is rock-hard. But methane, ethane and propane slosh around in all three states: solid, liquid and gaseous. The surface of this moon is nearly impossible to see from space at visual wavelengths; thick, orange smog pervades the place. This hazy atmosphere is rich with organic compounds.\u000a\u000aFortunately, Cassini can see in infrared and radar wavelengths. And the Cassini orbiter carried a lander called Huygens, which touched down on Titan's surface in January 2005. Huygens carried cameras down through the atmosphere. And, upon soft-landing on the shore of a hydrocarbon lake, it sent close-ups of rounded pebbles, which were probably made of water. The landforms on Titan are eerily familiar; they look a lot like coastlines and river lands on Earth.\u000a\u000aTitan, too, must be warm inside. This moon changes shape as it orbits Saturn once every 16 days. Cassini measured Titan's tidal bulging, finding the surface rising and falling on the order of 30 feet (9 meters). If Titan were completely solid, those tides would be at least 10 times less pronounced, scientists have said.\u000a\u000aBut the floor of Titan's subsurface ocean may be compacted and frozen, not warm, scientists have said. This could prevent warm liquid water from receiving the complex mix of minerals necessary for life to arise, at least from below. Therefore, it's critical to know if the organic-rich surface of Titan can "communicate" with the subsurface seas.\u000a\u000aOne great mystery about Titan is how so much methane can be present at its surface. Methane breaks down quickly, so something must be replenishing it. If there are deep cracks, or cryovolcanic vents, through which ammonia from a salty underground ocean may rise, sunlight would break down the molecules, thus liberating lots of methane. That same pathway could let surface material and atmospheric organic material seep or slide down to the waters beneath. In that case, life may be possible within Titan's interior ocean, even if its floor is frozen. [Amazing Photos: Titan, Saturn's Largest Moon]\u000a\u000aLike Enceladus and Titan, the Saturnian moons Dione and Tethys are subject to the warping and twisting effects of Saturn's tidal gravity. And both of these worlds show bright, relatively smooth and roughly circular surface patches where ponds of liquid water appear to have frozen across craters. They would make nice skating rinks. These events likely happened relatively recently on geologic time scales.\u000a\u000aDione is similar to Enceladus but, at 700 miles (1,100 km) in diameter, is about two times larger. Dione's icy crust is much thicker than that of Enceladus, boasting a substantial 60 miles (100 km) of crystallized water. But a recent study based on Cassini's gravity measurements suggests that a tremendous quantity of liquid water sloshes beneath that shell.\u000a\u000aThe floor of Dione's subsurface ocean is probably the rocky core of the moon itself, according to the study. A future submarine probe may find many sources of heat and mineral nutrients to sustain life, if biology ever began there \u2014 or was seeded from afar. Dione's waters likely have been liquid through most of the moon's history, adding the vital element of time for biology to evolve and differentiate, researchers have said.\u000a\u000aSuch "snow-globe worlds" \u2014 bodies with cold crystal exteriors housing warm liquid oceans full of particles cascading and mixing \u2014 are not unique to Saturn.\u000a\u000aThe dwarf planet Pluto may enclose such an ocean. Pluto and its largest moon Charon, which is about half as wide as the dwarf planet itself, can be considered a binary system. Their mutual attraction may heat up their interiors, and parts of Pluto seem to have been resurfaced in the recent past, scientists have said.\u000a\u000aGiant Jupiter exerts massive tidal forces on the four large moons first noted by Galileo Galilei four centuries ago. The innermost of these moons, Io, almost seems to be turning inside out. More than 400 active sulfur volcanoes blast this moon's guts into space. Its core of molten iron singes the surface from below. Of the worlds in our solar system, Io may bear the closest resemblance to classical notions of hell. All of its water long since lost, it's the driest object in the solar system.\u000a\u000aThere are no water oceans on Io. But each of its three siblings \u2014 Europa, Ganymede and Callisto \u2014 encloses a sea beneath its surface.\u000a\u000aEuropa, which is slightly smaller than Earth's moon, holds a thin oxygen atmosphere. This world sports the smoothest surface in the solar system, with very few impact craters, implying that it's being repaved with water ice from inside, scientists have said. Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have spotted hints of water-vapor plumes emanating from Europa that may be similar to the "cryogeysers" of Enceladus.\u000a\u000aSaturn's ocean-harboring moons get most of the press, but the ringed planet's many dry satellites are fascinating in their own right. Each Saturnian moon is a unique jewel in the majestic planet's necklace.\u000a\u000aSome of these moons, like Mimas, look like the results of ancient, catastrophic collisions. Shady Phoebe, with its inky-black surface, pours matter out into space. It tints the rings and stains one hemisphere of Iapetus, the "next moon in" toward Saturn, with dark reddish shading. Sparky Hyperion is lightweight and spongy \u2014 almost like a giant piece of volcanic pumice \u2014 and electrically active. A few moons apparently are captured asteroids, visitors from deep space that strayed too close. And Cassini has spotted clumpy cocoons within the rings where tiny future moons may be growing. Together, the many moons of Saturn form an enthralling exhibit of nature's creativity.\u000a\u000aFor a deeper look into all that Cassini has found in its 13 years in the Saturn system, watch the 73-minute documentary " Kingdom of Saturn \u2014 Cassini's Epic Quest ," available at Amazon XiveTV.\u000a\u000aThe author, @DavidSkyBrody, is the writer and director of " Kingdom of Saturn \u2014 Cassini's Epic Quest ," a documentary look back at the mission, available at Amazon XiveTV.

aVEarth's orbit within the sun's habitable zone means its temperatures are just right for life. But icy worlds located within their star's habitable zone may abruptly skip from too cold to too hot without going through a habitable stage, a new study finds.\u000a\u000aThe finding suggests that there may be fewer potentially habitable worlds than scientists previously thought, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aWhereas Venus seems too hot for life and Mars seems too cold, Earth lies between Venus and Mars, where temperatures have the potential to be just right for its surface to possess liquid water. This "Goldilocks" zone is also known as the habitable zone, because on Earth, there is life virtually wherever there is liquid water.\u000a\u000aStars like the sun brighten over time. This raises the possibility that a planet or moon that starts out cold and icy around a young dim star, such as early Earth, may eventually warm to a stable habitable state as the star grows more luminous. [How Habitable Zones for Alien Planets and Stars Work (Infographic)]\u000a\u000aHowever, the new study finds that some planets may go directly from a Mars-like icehouse stage to a Venus-like hothouse phase, bypassing Earth-like habitable conditions.\u000a\u000a"Previously, studies suggested that icy planets and moons, such as [Jupiter's moon] Europa, will become habitable for life after their surface ice or snow melts," said study lead author Jun Yang, of Peking University in Beijing. "Our work shows that this will not happen."\u000a\u000aThe climate of a water-rich planet depends on at least two factors. One is how much ice covers its surface. Ice has a high albedo, meaning it reflects much of the light that falls onto it back to space before the light can warm the planet's surface. In this way, the ice cools the planet, which leads to the formation of more ice and makes the planet even colder. The second factor is the amount of water vapor in the planet's atmosphere; water vapor is a greenhouse gas that traps heat, warming a planet, which leads more water to evaporate and makes the planet even warmer.\u000a\u000aThe albedo of ice plays a dominant role in the climate of icy planets. A 2004 study suggested that Earth escaped a possible "snowball phase" because the sun brightened over time and because volcanic activity on Earth released carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that helped the planet retain heat.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, many icy bodies, such as Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, do not release large amounts of greenhouse gases via volcanoes. As such, researchers wanted to see how these worlds evolved if they had only the light of their stars to help warm them.\u000a\u000aIn the new study, the scientists developed a global climate model that simulated the evolution of the climate of an icy planet lacking greenhouse gases other than water vapor. This 3D computer model included multiple layers of the atmosphere, as well as winds and their effects on temperatures, clouds, water vapor, snow and ice, according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that, without the presence of greenhouse gases besides water vapor, icy bodies needed a lot of energy from their stars before they started melting \u2014 about 10 to 40 percent more than Earth gets from the sun. When the ice finally did melt in simulations, the resulting drop in albedo made these worlds much warmer very quickly. This rapid warming often led to greenhouse stages in which most or all of the water oceans vaporized, rendering these worlds uninhabitable for water-based life as it is known on Earth.\u000a\u000a"The finding suggests the number of potentially habitable planets and moons may be less than previously estimated, especially for small icy planets and icy moons," Yang told Space.com.\u000a\u000aThe paper detailing the new findings was published online July 31 in the journal Nature Geoscience.\u000a\u000aFollow Charles Q.

aVShuttling across the country aboard Air Force Two, Vice President Mike Pence has been a loyal messenger for President Donald Trump. At the same time, he has been carving out his own political identity as the steady understudy to a mercurial president.\u000a\u000aThe Republican vice president has raised more than $1 million in recent months for his political committee, headlined GOP events in such key states as Iowa and Ohio, and hosted Republican VIPs for dinner at his formal residence in Washington. Pence is also preparing to take his fourth overseas trip in the last six months, a schedule that has removed him from the Trump White House's daily palace intrigue and the special counsel's investigation into the Trump administration's ties with Russia.\u000a\u000aThe vice president's push-and-pull with Trump was reflected in his office's vigorous response to a New York Times report that suggested he might be taking steps to position himself for a 2020 presidential campaign. Pence said in a lengthy statement Sunday that the report was "categorically false." The vice president's spokesman made multiple appearances on cable networks Monday to push back against the story.\u000a\u000a"The political activities of the vice president are 150 percent in support of the president's agenda. Anyone who asserts otherwise is uninformed," said Phil Musser, a longtime Pence adviser.\u000a\u000aFew Republican operatives believe that Pence would challenge Trump in the 2020 Republican primary election. But at the same time, Republicans privately concede that Trump could be the first president since Richard Nixon to leave office mid-term or not to seek re-election -- either for political or personal reasons. Pence would be ill-advised not to prepare for an early Trump exit, as unlikely as it may be, they say.\u000a\u000a"I think that Pence is trying to help prepare for the ticket to be re-elected in four years," said former GOP congressman Vin Weber, who keeps in regular touch with administration officials. "But it's ridiculous to say that it never crosses your mind that the president might not be on the ballot for whatever reason, be it health or political."\u000a\u000aAs Trump's approval ratings sag, Pence is bound by a delicate political reality: His fate is likely tied to Trump's. A successful Trump presidency could help position the 58-year-old Pence to run for president in 2024. A failed Trump presidency, by contrast, could forever stain Pence's political future.\u000a\u000aBeyond his frequent travel, the vice president has sought to separate himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\u000a\u000aWhen questions arose about Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and other Trump officials meeting with a Russian attorney in June 2016, Pence's office issued a terse statement noting that it took place before he joined the Trump ticket. His spokesman later added that Pence did not meet with any Russians during the campaign.\u000a\u000aPence has also traveled to nine countries as vice president so far and plans to make a four-nation trip to South America next week, creating space between his office and the churn of stories about White House shake-ups or the president's daily tweets.\u000a\u000aBut he has loyally backed Trump's policies and agenda. Pence, who served in Congress for a dozen years, rarely begins a speech without passing along the president's greetings and has acted as Trump's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill, convening weekly dinners with Republican lawmakers and business leaders at his residence at the Naval Observatory. Even in private meetings, Pence doesn't deviate from his effusive Trump praise.\u000a\u000a"He's an experienced legislator who can help bridge gaps between members of our conference or between the Congress and the president," said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who attended a dinner in late June.\u000a\u000aThe meetings help strengthen the vice president's political network in the long term. But they also help the Trump administration's connection to an anxious Republican establishment in the short term.\u000a\u000a"We're in the midst of a very unconventional presidency that makes a lot of Republicans in the establishment uneasy," veteran GOP operative Ryan Williams said. "I think some ambitious Republicans have the thought in the back of their minds that if something were to happen, they may run. But they would never launch a primary challenge against Trump."\u000a\u000aPence stoked discussions about his political future when he formed his Great America Committee in May, allowing him to raise money to support Republican candidates and fund political travel.\u000a\u000aThrough the end of June, Pence raised $540,000 for the committee among donors that include Indianapolis businessman Allan Hubbard, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, Houston attorney Mark Lanier, Indianapolis attorney Bob Grand and Republican lobbyist Marc Lampkin, a former adviser to ex-House Speaker John Boehner.\u000a\u000aMore recently, the committee raised $1 million at a Washington fundraiser that included an introduction from the president's daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, and featured Republican congressional leaders and dozens of lawmakers. FEC filings show the committee paid $50,000 in consulting fees in June to the Atlanta firm of Pence adviser Nick Ayers, a Republican strategist who was brought aboard by Pence this summer to be his chief of staff. It also paid more than $60,000 to the Indiana firm led by Pence adviser Marty Obst.\u000a\u000aThe vice president's office has downplayed the PACs creation, saying the former governor needed to start a federal committee to pay for his political activities.\u000a\u000a"Mike has a more robust portfolio than a traditional vice president which would include these types of political activities. It doesn't mean he's waiting for the president to stumble, it means he's a team player," said Curt Smith, a former campaign adviser to Pence who runs the Indiana Family Institute.\u000a\u000aPence also remains an important liaison to Trump's conservative base. His public schedule has included addresses to Christian leaders who have stuck with Trump despite his lagging approval ratings, groups like Focus on the Family and the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians, which was organized by Franklin Graham.\u000a\u000aIn June, Pence and a group of aides discussed health care and taxes during a closed-door meeting with industrialist billionaires Charles Koch and his chief lieutenants on the sidelines of the conservative group's Colorado conference.\u000a\u000aAs the meeting was breaking up, the vice president took Charles Koch's arm and said, "Can you stick around for a few minutes?" The aides departed, leaving Pence and Koch in the room for a private meeting.\u000a\u000aPence will be headlining another Koch event later this month in Richmond, Va., where he will also raise money for former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who is running for Virginia governor.\u000a\u000a"He's a known quantity. We all trust Mike," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.

We should not be surprised if the Communist dictatorship develops a hydrogen bomb \u2013 the ultimate atomic weapon \u2013 with the potential to kill millions of people.\u000a\u000aA Defense Department official I spoke to recently on the condition of not revealing his name told me it now appears the North Koreans are working to finish development of an H-bomb, and that they could succeed in as soon as six to 18 months. Such a bomb would be many times more powerful than the atomic bombs the United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan that led to the end of World War II.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un claimed early last year to have tested an H-bomb, but most experts debunked such claims, arguing that the North had developed what is called a boosted fission weapon \u2013 or in layman\u2019s terms, a more powerful atomic bomb. However, reports at the time coming out of South Korea claimed that North Korea was likely \u201cone level away from a hydrogen bomb.\u201d

Some articles talked about old-fashioned chicken and waffle dinners.\u000a\u000aThe time capsule was discovered in June when officials moved the "Johnny Reb" statue at Lake Eola Park. Dyer announced plans to move the Confederate statue after an outcry from some residents and officials who said the monument only solidified racism and white supremacy, The Orlando Sentinel reported. Supporters of the statue argued it honored fallen soldiers.\u000a\u000aThe statue was moved to Greenwood Cemetery where a plot of land stands for Confederate soldiers. The statue is set to be reassembled.\u000a\u000aThe items will be processed, categorized and preserved for archive purposes, FOX35 reported.\u000a\u000aCONFEDERATE FLAG DEBATE: PROTECTING HATRED PRESERVES FREEDOM\u000a\u000aThe city delayed opening the time capsule out of fear of damaging the contents in the box. The United Daughters of the Confederacy, an 1894 organization who claim members hid the time capsule in the statue, also took issue with city officials opening the treasure.\u000a\u000aPatt Schnurr, a member of the organization, said the United Daughters of the Confederacy should have the right to open the time capsule.\u000a\u000a"They are deliberately doing this," she told FOX35.

aVAnyone sweating it over the robot apocalypse will be delighted to learn that it probably won't be happening for a while, at least if Boston Dynamics' recent fail is anything to go by.\u000a\u000aThe company has built a deserved reputation in recent years for creating incredibly capable robots, among them BigDog, WildCat, Handle, SpotMini, and Atlas.\u000a\u000aAh yes, Atlas. Although this 5-foot 9-inch humanoid robot spends most of its time wowing us mere humans with its stunning ability to stroll nonchalantly across various kinds of challenging terrain as well as grab and effortlessly lift heavy objects, it recently had everyone laughing in the aisles after tripping over on stage and landing in a heap.\u000a\u000aThe unfortunate incident took place last month during a Boston Dynamics presentation at the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders. On stage, CEO Marc Raibert was showing off Atlas and SpotMini, a four-legged "robot giraffe" capable of picking up objects and carrying out various chores.\u000a\u000aDuring the slot, an assistant controlled SpotMini remotely, while Atlas used its sensors to get around. Keen to demonstrate Atlas's ability to lock onto an object and respond accordingly, the team placed a box on the stage for the robot to pick up. At first, its vision system failed to notice the box, which caused a few chuckles in the audience.\u000a\u000a"It's the normal course of business for things not to always work right," Raibert said, unaware that in a couple of minutes his words would ring even truer.\u000a\u000aA moment later, Atlas located the box, lifted it up, and put it back down again. The audience applauded in response.\u000a\u000aFor the next demo, the team decided to have some fun, getting SpotMini to move the box a little bit away from Atlas every time it bent down to grab it. Eventually SpotMini let Atlas take the box, and once again, the audience showed its appreciation.\u000a\u000aAs Raibert thanked SpotMini and Atlas for their efforts, Atlas wandered off toward the back of the stage, still holding the box. It seemed perfectly in control, confident in where it was heading, until it tripped on a stage light and went crashing to the ground, disappearing behind a curtain as it did so. SpotMini trotted over, seemingly curious to see if its buddy was OK.\u000a\u000aSeeing the funny side, Raibert quipped, "I wish I could pretend it was supposed to do that."\u000a\u000aKnowing Atlas's remarkable ability to steady itself if it gets shoved, its on-stage mishap may surprise some. The robot is actually capable of getting back on its feet after a fall, though we've know idea if Atlas managed it this time around. But with every unexpected tumble will come analysis and improvements, taking us another step closer to the day when robots have us for breakfast.\u000a\u000aBut until that happens, let's enjoy a couple more robot fails, such as this one by Honda's Asimo robot a few years back \u2026\u000a\u000aAnd this hilarious compilation of humanoid robots crashing down during a DARPA contest in 2015 \u2026

Tom Shillue reacted to the breaking news on The Tom Shillue Show.\u000a\u000aTom was joined by Mary Kissel of The Wall Street Journal. Mary did not think that this new revelation really means that much because what is being investigated does not rise to a crime as of right now. She compared the Russia investigation to a fishing expedition, and said that it still does not appear to be going anywhere.\u000a\u000aMary does not think that the investigation should include looking into any business ties that President Trump may have had with Russia. Mueller should only be investigating whether or not there was collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 Election.\u000a\u000aAccording to Mary, this all goes back to Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. She thinks that the AG's decision was the "original sin" in the whole thing.\u000a\u000aTo hear the interview, click above!

aVFOX NEWS - Less than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.

aVWon't Back Down! Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly issued subpoenas to appear before the grand jury that he has convened to probe a meeting that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016. Two sources told Reuters of the move on Thursday, saying it was more proof that Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in last year's election was picking up speed. The former FBI director made headlines earlier in the day when it was revealed that he had impaneled a new grand jury to lead the probe. Trump Jr. and Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016 -- along with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- after being told that they would receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The meeting had been brokered by British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who has worked with the Trumps in the past. In a statement Thursday, White House special counsel Ty Cobb claimed he didn't know Mueller had begun using the grand jury or issuing subpoenas.\u000a\u000aFormer Defense Attorney & FNC Host Gregg Jarrett breaks it down!

aVThe rhetoric coming from North Korea is heating up, which is a good indication that the latest U.S.-led action in the UN Security Council got the attention of the paranoid Pyongyang leadership. Last weekend the world saw a strong and united Security Council tell the North Korean regime that its illegal and dangerous acts must stop. This time, continuation of their illegal nuclear program was met with actions, not just words.\u000a\u000aThe Security Council\u2019s action has thrown the dictators of Pyongyang off their stride because it hits them where it hurts most: The hard currency the regime gets from its exports and the slave labor of the North Korean people. The resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled on North Korea. It targets the regime\u2019s exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood \u2013 the mainstays of its economy \u2013 and reduces them by about one-third. It is the most stringent set of sanctions the United Nations has leveled on any country in a generation.\u000a\u000aAlmost as important as the content of the sanctions is the fact that the Security Council spoke with one voice in imposing them. North Korea\u2019s neighbor, China, has a critical role to play when it comes to Pyongyang. Not only did the Chinese vote for the resolution, they worked cooperatively with the United States and other countries to bring the resolution to a vote. Russia \u2013 another country that has favored North Korea at times \u2013 voted for the resolution as well.\u000a\u000aThe UN\u2019s action also puts a long overdue spotlight on the plight of the North Korean people. The development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is expensive. While its own people go hungry, the North Korean regime diverts its scarce resources \u2013 most of which come from the exports targeted in the UN resolution \u2013 to these illegal programs. What\u2019s more, North Korea is facing its worst drought in sixteen years. The regime has shamelessly begun to ask for international assistance, even as it plows its hard currency into nuclear development. We will continue to stand for the human dignity and rights of the North Korean people even as we respond to the regime\u2019s nuclear threat.\u000a\u000aWhile its own people go hungry, the North Korean regime diverts its scarce resources \u2013 most of which come from the exports targeted in the UN resolution \u2013 to these illegal programs.\u000a\u000aThese sanctions are a big win for peace and security, the United Nations, and a unified Trump Administration foreign policy team. But we are not kidding ourselves. We have not solved the problem \u2013 not even close. The threat posed by an outlaw, nuclearized North Korea has not gone away. In fact, it is rapidly growing more serious. In just the last month, North Korea has fired two missiles capable of reaching San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris or Sydney.\u000a\u000aThe members of the Security Council and all nations must do more to increase the pressure on North Korea. We\u2019ve passed sanctions that cut deep \u2013 but only if they are enforced. All UN member states now have the obligation to implement these and past sanctions on North Korea.\u000a\u000aFor our part, the United States will continue to keep all options on the table. We prefer to end this crisis through dialogue, but our eyes are wide open. We will fight to see this resolution and others implemented to the fullest. We will continue to put maximum pressure on North Korea at the United Nations and elsewhere to change its ways. And our joint military exercises with South Korea will go on as they have for nearly 40 years. Despite what the dictators in Pyongyang claim, these exercises are meant to protect the United States and our allies. Unlike the North Korean nuclear and missile programs, they are open, transparent and defense-oriented.\u000a\u000aSaturday was a strong day at the United Nations \u2013 all the bluster coming from Pyongyang is proof of that. But we will need many more such days in order to end the crisis created by the North Korean regime. The goal of the United States is and has always been a stable Korean peninsula, at peace, without nuclear weapons. It is now up to the North Korean regime to demonstrate, through its actions, that it shares this goal.\u000a\u000aNikki Haley is the United States Ambassador to the United Nations.

aVDonald Trump is now officially on a working vacation, and not a minute too soon. Above all, he should give his Twitter thumbs a rest.\u000a\u000aAlthough his administration had a significant foreign policy accomplishment this weekend \u2013 the United Nations\u2019 Security Council\u2019s unanimous approval of the toughest-ever economic sanctions against North Korea to punish Pyongyang for its ongoing nuclear weapons program - President Trump distracted press attention from that achievement with a Twitter storm on Monday morning of no less than seven early bird attacks on the press.\u000a\u000aYes, the MainStreamMedia\u2019s coverage of the first six months of his presidency has been unusually, almost unrelentingly, negative in substance and tone. As a report on Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office by the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center argues, no president has had as much or as negative press coverage in modern history.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump was the topic of over 40 percent of all news stories in major publications and television \u2013 three times the amount afforded previous presidents. But the Trump presidency's astoundingly inaccurate claims and vulgar assertions, plus attacks on fellow Republicans - in most part thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s own tweets - have also set new standards for negativity.\u000a\u000aNegative reports in mainstream publications and TV outstripped positive ones on average by 80 percent to 20 percent. Even during his best week of coverage \u2013 his missile strike on Syria in April to punish President Bashar Assad for having used nerve gas on civilians \u2013 news reports about him were still 70 percent negative to 30 percent positive.\u000a\u000aThe president will hardly find the latest news stories more edifying. A case in point is Newsweek\u2019s new issue featuring a particularly savage article which reports that although candidate Trump lambasted his predecessor for playing golf and vowed not to follow suit, President Trump has so far spent 40 days at golf clubs at a cost of $55 million to taxpayers while passing zero pieces of major legislation. The magazine\u2019s cover feature - \u201cTrump, America\u2019s Boy King: Golf and TV Won\u2019t Make America Great Again\u201c - features an illustration of him in a recliner surrounded by junk food, his cell phone and a TV remote. The illustration\u2019s title is \u201cLazy Boy.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite his constant need to be at the center of the media\u2019s and the nation\u2019s attention, President Trump has had only one solo press conference, fewer than any other president in the age of television. (George W. Bush held five his first year; Bill Clinton had only two in 1998, the single-most low-rated point in his presidency; Ronald Reagan had 31.) Fielding questions about wide-ranging, complex subjects might prove embarrassing, his aides may fear.\u000a\u000aBut the president has found ample time to tweet. In the first six months of his presidency, Newsweek reports, Trump sent 1,029 tweets, many of which contained inaccuracies. It is hard to forget Mr. Trump\u2019s dubious claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign, or his succession of smears of critics and even his own Cabinet members, including his infamous attack on Attorney General Jeff Sessions for having recused himself, as legally required, from the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aHis perennial favorite target, however, has been the media for reporting facts that displease him. The Newsweek article, for instance, notes that rather than implanting his own vision of how to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by enacting his own sweeping reforms and new iniatives, "15 of the 42 bills he has signed have rolled back rules and regulations issued under Obama's administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post recently reported that only 50 of some 400 key posts in his administration have been filled, and only another 165 people nominated for them. The State Department is a particular embarrassment: almost none of the undersecretary posts is occupied by his nominees; 20 of some 26 assistant-secretary of state slots remain empty or filled by Obama holdovers.\u000a\u000aTrump supporters hope that recently designated White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly will bring some structure and discipline to the notoriously chaotic White House. Some analysts already see progress. All White House aides and advisers must now report through Kelly\u2019s office, as must all seeking meetings with Mr. Trump, including apparently daughter Ivanka and son-in-law and envoy to everything Jared Kushner. Gen. Kelly has also taken steps to ensure that the information Mr. Trump receives is accurate, partly to prevent him from re-tweeting obvious misinformation.\u000a\u000aMonday morning\u2019s Twitter tornado was a clear departure from the discipline Gen. Kelly is struggling so mightily to impose. It seems to have been sparked by a weekend report in The New York Times that several Republicans, including his own vice president, are preparing to succeed Mr. Trump in 2020 if he chooses not to or cannot serve a second term. Though Mike Pence was quick to denounce the report as more fake news, the morning Tweet storm suggests that President Trump was not assuaged.

On Tuesday morning, President Trump retweeted a Fox News story that U.S. Amb. Nikki Haley said contained classified information. In a Tuesday morning interview with the network's "Fox & Friends," Ms. Haley, apparently unaware that her boss had just retweeted the story, declined to comment on the Fox News account because it contained \u201cclassified information.\u201d It was \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d to disseminate such information, she said, seemingly unaware that Mr. Trump had just done so.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Fox News, citing anonymous intelligence sources, reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected North Korea loading two Stormpetrel anti-ship cruise missiles on a Wonsan guided-missile patrol boat at Toejo Dong on North Korea\u2019s east coast. This was the first time that such missiles had been deployed on such a platform since 2014, which the story called \u201cmore evidence that North Korea isn't listening to the diplomatic threats from the West.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has repeatedly condemned leaks to the media and called for leakers to be punished, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced new measures to do last week.

aVBy Daniel Gouré, Real Clear Defense\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and its Coalition partners have been fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) for almost a decade. During much of this period, ISIS was but one of many Sunni terrorist groups operating in Iraq and, after 2011, in Syria. But beginning in 2014, ISIS swept out of Syria and into Iraq, capturing Mosul in June and almost reaching the gates of Baghdad.

aVFoxconn may in fact be heading to Michigan, according to Gov. Rick Snyder.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aFoxconn Chairman Terry Gou was quoted in Chinese media reports as saying the company, a major supplier for Apple (AAPL), might open a new facility in Michigan to research new automobile technology like self-driving vehicles. Michigan, the home of General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), would be the second U.S. location for Foxconn. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturer recently announced plans to build a massive $10 billion plant in Wisconsin.\u000a\u000aGov. Snyder is optimistic that Foxconn will open a facility in Michigan, but said what exactly it is has not been determined and it could be a few months before any potential deal takes shape.\u000a\u000aIn a phone interview from Shanghai, where he was concluding a nine-day trade trip in China, Snyder told the Associated Press Monday night there is a "strong possibility" for Foxconn to still locate in the state after the company in recent weeks picked neighboring Wisconsin for a $10 billion display panel plant with 3,000 employees that could grow to 13,000. Snyder told The Associated Press that Gou invited him for dinner, meetings and a tour of the company's sprawling factory in Shenzhen near Hong Kong that employs some 200,000 workers.\u000a\u000aThey discussed the autonomous vehicle industry and advanced manufacturing, Snyder said. The company, he said, is highly advanced in tooling, machinery and robotics similarly to Michigan but does not yet have much of a U.S. presence in those sectors.\u000a\u000a"We had very healthy, very good discussions about Michigan's strengths and how it could be very good for Foxconn to be present in Michigan in some fashion. What it is has yet to be determined," he said.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aSnyder declined to confirm that Foxconn is eyeing an autonomous vehicle facility but said "that would be one of the natural things that they could well be looking at." Foxconn said last month that its Wisconsin announcement was just the first of several unspecified investments the company will be making in the U.S.\u000a\u000a"It's going really well," Snyder said of the courtship. "But we're still getting to know each other, we're still working through that. They can make their own business decisions. But we're going to continue to present them good opportunities of what we can do in Michigan."\u000a\u000aLittle known to consumers, the maker of iPhones and other gadgets is a giant in the electronics industry thanks to its dominant position in the global manufacturing supply chain. Working conditions at Foxconn's factories in China have come under scrutiny in the past due to labor practices and suicides.\u000a\u000aSnyder and state lawmakers last month enacted job-creation tax incentives, including one tailored to companies such as Foxconn that add at least 3,000 jobs that pay the average regional wage. But Wisconsin offered what Snyder called a "gigantic" $3 billion incentive package to land the factory that will construct liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors used in televisions and computers.\u000a\u000aSnyder said Foxconn has other projects on its radar that "would be better suited for Michigan." He said it is too early to say how many jobs could come with a Foxconn facility in Michigan. He is hopeful that talks continue in the next few months and "things start solidifying."\u000a\u000aThe trip was the Snyder administration's seventh mission to China. Snyder said one theme throughout the trip was China's increased interest in autonomous mobility, and he wants Michigan to capitalize on potential business opportunities in the emerging sector.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

aVBy Jeff Blehar, The New York Post\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Radiohead, by general consensus the most culturally important rock group in the world, announced that it would be extending the concert tour for its widely acclaimed 2016 album \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool\u201d into 2017, the biggest surprise of all was the final show on the schedule: Tel Aviv. On Wednesday the band will play in Israel for the first time in 17 years.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also the first time since the 2005 emergence of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement, created by Western pro-Palestinian activists as a means of punishing Israel through academic and cultural boycotts not only of the country but of Israeli artists and academics who perform or speak abroad.\u000a\u000aRock stars garner far more media attention than academics, of course, so trying to prevent bands from playing in Israel is a key component of isolating Israel not just politically but culturally. To see Israeli fans rejected by their heroes.\u000a\u000aThus it was a major public scandal to Western activists (particularly in Europe) to find out that Radiohead wasn\u2019t on board with it.\u000a\u000aRadiohead\u2019s history with Israel is surprisingly longstanding and deep, on both a professional and personal level. It was the country where the band scored its first hit single (\u201cCreep,\u201d which took off there after flopping in its initial release everywhere else across the world).

Nevertheless, the researchers hope the work will help programmers develop better defenses against these types of attacks.\u000a\u000aAs a backup to this type of situation, driverless cars use several inputs, including hyper accurate GPS mapping, to help them avoid issues caused by confusing signage, but still need to sort out the data to make the correct -- sometimes life or death -- decision.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Sun, the researchers suggest this kind of 'contextual' information is of the utmost importance to the safe operation of autonomous cars.\u000a\u000aUNBELTED REAR SEAT PASSENGERS CAN KILL DRIVERS IN A CRASH

aVPrimetime Propaganda is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.\u000a\u000aIn this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged\u2014and continue to use\u2014their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment\u2014it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\u000a\u000aBut don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages. After reading this groundbreaking exposé, readers will never watch television the same way again.

aVA federal judge has blocked efforts to bring back to U.S. Capitol grounds a controversial painting that depicts a police officer as a pig.\u000a\u000aDavid Pulphus, a student artist from Missouri, and Rep. William Clay, his Democratic congressional representative, had sued Architect of the Capitol Stephen Ayers for removing the painting in January amid a showdown with law enforcement groups and Republican lawmakers who opposed the \u201cart.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. District Judge John D. Bates said in his decision that the government has used its editorial discretion in the selection and presentation of the piece.\u000a\u000aAs a result, it's engaging in "government speech" and the plaintiffs have no First Amendment right to display the painting.\u000a\u000aLeah J. Tulin, a lawyer representing Pulphus and Clay, says they are likely to appeal.\u000a\u000aThe painting appeared to show a pig in a police uniform aiming a gun at a black wolf holding a sign that says, \u201cSTOP KILL.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbove the scene, two birds -- one black, one white -- fight, and beside them, a black protester holding a scale of justice is crucified.\u000a\u000aLaw enforcement groups had strongly objected to the painting\u2019s display on the Capitol complex grounds, with one group calling it \u201creprehensible, repugnant and repulsive.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe art work was part of an annual contest sponsored by Clay, D-Mo., and is said to be a symbolic representation of injustice, inequality and the unrest in Ferguson following the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe painting had hung in a tunnel leading to the Capitol for more than seven months before it became a lightning rod of controversy.\u000a\u000aRep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., took the painting down and returned it to Clay\u2019s office last year. Hunter argued that it was inappropriate.

aVThe Interior Department on Monday unveiled a plan to protect the threatened sage grouse that gives Western states greater flexibility to allow mining, logging and other economic development where it now is prohibited.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below\u000a\u000aInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced the strategy for the ground-dwelling bird that has suffered a dramatic population decline across its 11-state range. Zinke insisted that the federal government and the states can work together to protect the sage grouse and its habitat while not slowing economic growth and job creation.\u000a\u000aWhile the federal government has a responsibility under the Endangered Species Act to protect the bird, officials also have an obligation "to be a good neighbor and a good partner," Zinke said. The new plan ensures that conservation efforts "do not impede local economic opportunities," he said.\u000a\u000aThe plan comes after a 60-day review Zinke ordered in June of a 2015 plan imposed by the Obama administration. The plan set land-use policies across the popular game-bird's 11-state range intended to keep it off the federal endangered species list.\u000a\u000aMining companies, ranchers and governors in some Western states \u2014 especially Utah, Idaho and Nevada \u2014 said the plan ordered by former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell would impede oil and gas drilling and other economic activity.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental groups said Jewell's plan did not do enough to protect the sage grouse from extinction.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aThe ground-dwelling sage grouse, long associated with the American West, has lengthy, pointed tail feathers and is known for the male's elaborate courtship display in which air sacs in the neck are inflated to make a popping sound.\u000a\u000aMillions of sage grouse once roamed the West but development, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that encourages wildfires has reduced the bird's population to fewer than 500,000 across 11 states from California to the Dakotas.\u000a\u000aStates affected by the plan are California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\u000a\u000aZinke said in June that "state agencies are really at the forefront of efforts to maintain healthy fish and wildlife populations" across the country, adding that the Trump administration is committed to ensuring that state voices are heard in decisions affecting land use and wildlife management.\u000a\u000aIn particular, Zinke said he has received complaints from several Western governors that the Obama administration ignored or minimized their concerns as the 2015 sage-grouse plan was developed. Republican governors in Idaho, Utah and Nevada want more flexibility and have urged that conservation efforts focus on bird populations in a particular state rather than on habitat management that frequently results in land-use restrictions.\u000a\u000aThe new plan is intended to provide flexibility to states instead of a "one-size-fits-all solution," Zinke said.\u000a\u000aOn the other side, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Republican Gov. Matt Mead of Wyoming told Zinke earlier this year they opposed any changes that would move "from a habitat-management model to one that sets population objectives for the states."\u000a\u000a"Wholesale changes to the land-use plans are likely not necessary at this time," they wrote in a May 26 letter.\u000a\u000aHickenlooper and Mead co-chair a federal-state sage grouse task force that worked to develop the 2015 plan, which was backed by more than $750 million in commitments from the government and outside groups to conserve land and restore the bird's historic range.\u000a\u000aNada Culver, a senior policy official at The Wilderness Society, denounced the new plan as an attempt to "abandon habitat protection for unfettered oil and gas development" in the West that "puts the entire landscape at risk."\u000a\u000aThe 60-day review "shows a callous disregard for nearly a decade of research and collaborative work by states and agencies, while ignoring the western communities who weighed in with millions of comments and who simply want to see the (Obama-era) plans left to work as intended," Culver said.\u000a\u000aKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based group that represents the oil and natural gas industry, said offering states more flexibility was a step in the right direction but did not go far enough to rewrite the 2015 plan.\u000a\u000a"Until Interior bites the bullet and starts amending these plans, it's merely postponing a real, needed correction," she said, adding that the revised sage grouse plan "will cause needless job loss and loss of economic opportunities" throughout the West.

aVThe lawyer for a British model allegedly abducted by "Black Death" kidnappers who intended to sell her to a buyer in the Middle East, hit back Monday over supposed holes in the 20-year-old beauty's story -- but acknowledged the woman left police with "understandable doubts."\u000a\u000aChloe Ayling said she was lured to Italy with the promise of a photo shoot, then drugged, stuffed into a suitcase, transported to an isolated farmhouse and held, at times in handcuffs, for almost a week.\u000a\u000aThe model told police the "terrifying experience" ended when her captor, who had threatened to hold her for ransom or advertise her as a sex slave on the criminal "dark web," decided instead to drop her off at the British consulate in Milan. Italian police have arrested a suspect in the bizarre series of events: a 30-year-old Polish man who claimed to be a paid killer.\u000a\u000aSince the story first broke, it has emerged that Ayling went shopping for groceries and shoes with her captor, raising questions about the degree of coercion she was under, The Guardian reported.\u000a\u000aAyling's lawyer acknowledged Monday that aspects of the case seem bizarre. Francesco Pesce told the Associated Press that investigators initially had "more than understandable doubts" about the model's story.\u000a\u000aA post shared by Chloe Ayling (@chloeayling) on Jun 28, 2017 at 8:31am PDT\u000a\u000aBRITISH MODEL SPEAKS OUT AFTER KIDNAPPING -- ALLEGEDLY BY MAN WHO WANTED TO AUCTION HER ON THE WEB\u000a\u000aIn a separate interview with the Guardian, Pesce said Ayling was scared to offer any resistance to her abductor\u2019s wishes, fearing there were other members of the gang who may have come after her.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were legitimate doubts [about her story] at the start, which were surpassed,\u201d Pesce told the Guardian. \u201cWhat Chloe told police during 10 hours, it wasn\u2019t easy on her.

Authorities said they have no evidence a ransom was paid.\u000a\u000aThen, on July 17, Ayling was dropped off at the British consulate in Milan.

"I've feared for my life, second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour."\u000a\u000aThis has not been the model's first brush with horrifying incident.

aVHe cements the media\u2019s reputation as the opposition party.\u000a\u000aBy GEORGE NEUMAYR | The American Spectator\u000a\u000aIt is impossible to overstate the partisan jackassery of CNN, which is at once a product of the cynical, ratings-driven scumbaggery of its head Jeff Zucker and the pretentious liberalism of its \u201creporters,\u201d almost all of whom come from Democratic circles. What an astonishing collection of frauds. With their anchormanish baritones, they try to hoodwink viewers into thinking they are \u201cserious\u201d journalists. But they are all just liberal activists playing reporters on TV. Jake Tapper was a Dem staffer. So was Jim Sciutto. Christiane Amanpour, last heard lecturing journalists on the need to drop \u201cneutrality\u201d in its coverage of Trump, is married to former Clinton staffer James Rubin. And the list goes on and on.\u000a\u000aOut of this ethos came Jim Acosta, who, thanks to Trump, has justly become the face of fake news. Acosta\u2019s hectoring of Stephen Miller on Wednesday \u2014 behavior indistinguishable from a La Raza activist at a Trump rally \u2014 confirms once again the journalistic bankruptcy of Jeff Zucker\u2019s CNN. Acosta doesn\u2019t need any encouragement to be a demagogic jerk, but Zucker has no doubt flashed that green light to him. (By the way, where are the successors to the Kalb brothers to tsk-tsk Zucker for his complete abandonment of \u201cobjective\u201d journalistic conventions in pursuit of the cheapest of entertainment values? That even those old charades no longer occur is itself proof of the media\u2019s status as an unapologetic opposition party.)\u000a\u000aBut conservatives should thank Acosta for pulling off CNN\u2019s mask completely. It reveals the face of an exceedingly dumb and arrogant liberal. Poets, according to the windy adage, are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. But Acosta on Wednesday was determined to turn Emma Lazarus into an acknowledged one. He demanded to know why the Trump administration wasn\u2019t using her poem as the organizing principle of immigration policy.

And unfortunately for the Trump administration, its recent efforts to rein in the so-called \u201chermit kingdom,\u201d while the boldest of any administration to date, are likely to fall short of stopping Pyongyang from developing an even more powerful nuclear weapon along with ever more advanced missiles to strike the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aBut before we dissect what Team Trump got wrong when it comes to North Korea\u2014and how they can still get it right\u2014we need to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000aThis administration dared do what no other has in the past: name Pyongyang its number one foreign policy priority.

Boyden Gray, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation morph into an open-ended inquisition? Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations.

aVHe should proceed quickly to get the facts out. So should congressional investigators.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy C. Boyden Gray, The Wall Street Journal\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWill Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation morph into an open-ended inquisition? Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations. Nor is there an obvious limit on their scope.

aVWhen General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied\u2014thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring.\u000a\u000aWashington realized that he couldn\u2019t beat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So carefully guarded were the members\u2019 identities that one spy\u2019s name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered enough information about the ring\u2019s activities to piece together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of the war.\u000a\u000a\u2022 Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have painted compelling portraits of George Washington\u2019s secret six:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2022 Robert Townsend, the reserved Quaker merchant and reporter who headed the Culper Ring, keeping his identity secret even from Washington;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Austin Roe, the tavern keeper who risked his employment and his life in order to protect the mission;\u000a\u000aCaleb Brewster, the brash young longshoreman who loved baiting the British and agreed to ferry messages between Connecticut and New York;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Abraham Woodhull, the curmudgeonly (and surprisingly nervous) Long Island bachelor with business and family excuses for traveling to Manhattan;\u000a\u000aJames Rivington, the owner of a posh coffeehouse and print shop where high-ranking British officers gossiped about secret operations;\u000a\u000a\u2022 Agent 355, a woman whose identity remains unknown but who seems to have used her wit and charm to coax officers to share vital secrets.\u000a\u000aIn George Washington\u2019s Secret Six, Townsend and his fellow spies finally receive their due, taking their place among the pantheon of heroes of the American Revolution.

aVSomeone brought a dog to mass at my parish this weekend. It lay smack in the middle of the main aisle, forcing parishioners to edge around it. No one said anything, but the symbolism was not lost on some in attendance: dogs may be going to church, but the universal Roman Catholic Church is going to the dogs.\u000a\u000aUnder Pope Francis, the church has abandoned many of its bedrock positions on issues like divorce and homosexuality in favor of a \u201cwhy not?\u201d attitude. Francis has scolded people for being rich, sided with illegal immigrants, and suggested the church should be a refuge for the poor.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aHe has sidelined conservative cardinals, installed like-minded allies in key jobs, taken personal control of the Knights of Malta for defying him, and generally sent the signal that behind his amiable smile and humble talk lurks a radically liberal agenda.\u000a\u000aThe latest example of the pope\u2019s blueprint for the future is contained in an article penned by two of his closest confidantes. They believe that conservative Catholics in the United States have formed a coalition with Evangelical Protestants to push Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, which the authors call a \u201cManichean vision.\u201d The article, in the Jesuit publication La Civiltà Cattolica, could not have been printed without Francis\u2019s knowledge and approval.\u000a\u000aThe pope left little doubt about his feelings toward Trump when the president and first lady visited the Vatican earlier this year. In their joint photo, Francis frowns as if he smelled something bad in the room.\u000a\u000aIn addition to rejecting Trump\u2019s worldview, the article\u2019s authors single out White House strategist Stephen Bannon as a \u201csupporter of apocalyptic geopolitics.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pope is expressing his displeasure at the election of Donald Trump as president and with the Catholics who voted for him,\u201d says Deal Hudson, former Catholic Outreach director for the Republican National Committee. \u201cIt came as a huge surprise to the establishment of the church, who were pulling for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, says Hudson, the pope is wielding his power as CEO of the Church to tell American Catholics \u201cwe are bad Christians. This was his way of calling us a basket of deplorables without using that phrase.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis pope does not like the culture war,\u201d says Robert Royal, president of the Faith and Reason Institute and a commentator on the Catholic network EWTN. \u201cThe real tragedy is they\u2019re trying to discredit some types of religious action in the public square, while they are very active in advocating for the environment, immigrants and stopping human trafficking.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrancis can run the church any way he wants. But demonizing conservative American Catholics is a risky business.

aVYou don\u2019t have to smoke to get lung cancer. If you\u2019re unlucky and don\u2019t take precautions, all you have to do is breathe the air in your home.\u000a\u000aRadon \u2014 a colorless and odorless radioactive gas found in soil \u2014 causes more than 21,000 deaths from lung cancer every year in the U.S. \u2014 more than carbon monoxide and house fires combined. Released from rock, soil and water, the uranium-derived gas can reach dangerous levels in even the best-built homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll houses tend to draw soil gas out of the ground to replace air that escapes out of the top whenever the house is warmer than the outside, which is almost every night year-round,\u201d says Bill Brodhead, president of WPB Enterprises, a radon mitigation company in Pennsylvania.\u000a\u000aARLO BABY MONITOR LETS YOU WATCH YOUR LITTLE ONE'S EVERY MOVE\u000a\u000a\u201cThe soil gas naturally contains radon, and often in very high concentrations. When radon decays, it changes to solid particles that cling to dust, water molecules or directly to your lung tissue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese particles decay and send off alpha particles that damage the lung tissue and increase the risk of getting lung cancer, which is the leading cancer killer in the U.S. and has one of the lowest five\u2013year survival rates of all cancers.\u000a\u000aBut you don\u2019t have to put up with high levels of radon in your home. Radon detectors have been around for years, but they\u2019re basically charcoal canisters that last for only a few days and have to be sent to a lab for analysis. Since radon levels fluctuate daily, these tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aBut now a Norway\u2013based company, Airthings, has created the Airthings Wave that uses digital sensors and smart home technology to measure radon levels over a long period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Charcoal] is the traditional way,\u201d Airthings CEO Øyvind Birkenes told Fox News. \u201cWe are going electronically, which enables you to monitor 24/7 over long periods of time \u2014 many, many years. And that\u2019s important, because radon gas fluctuates significantly over time. Over a day, it\u2019s amazing how much it changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Wave, a small, easy-to-install white disc that looks like a smoke detector, has an indicator light that can turn green (nothing to worry about), yellow (warning) or red (danger). Users can also check their radon levels or receive warning notifications through an app that records short- and long-term data.

aVWhat began as one veteran driving around his northern California community looking for homeless veterans who he could help out, has blossomed into a full-fledged foundation with help pouring in from around the country.\u000a\u000aFox News was first introduced to disabled veteran Kyle Cornwell in March after a local Sacramento TV station did a story on the work he was doing. At the time, the father-of-one said he wanted his efforts to becoming a nationwide movement.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Cornwell recently told Fox News. \u201cTo date, we have received more than 20,000 emails and phone calls from people that have started to do what we do in their communities. This was my ultimate goal.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe foundation is called H3 Movement, or Heroes Helping Heroes. At the moment, Cornwell and a group of volunteers \u2013 up to 200 at any time \u2013 pile into their cars and drive around Sacramento and surrounding areas looking for veterans who are homeless and need help.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had weapons pulled on me and I\u2019ve been jumped several times, but it\u2019s not going to stop me,\u201d he said, recounting how he goes beyond the streets and underpasses to find people that need help. \u201cThere are so many vets that you don\u2019t see. They aren\u2019t just sitting in the corner.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a storage unit, the foundation has hundreds of care packages with at least two weeks\u2019 worth of supplies that they hand out to people.\u000a\u000aBut it doesn\u2019t end there.\u000a\u000aH3 Movement is focusing on getting these men and women off the streets and have even secured jobs for some of them at local places and nearby ranches.\u000a\u000aCornwell said they have also been able to get many of the men and women in touch with family members.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe reached out to their families \u2013 a lot of them don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings tears to your eyes.

aVProgressive corporations enforce an ideological monoculture. Dissent and get fired.\u000a\u000aBy David French, The National Review\u000a\u000aWhen I talk about free speech, I often ask the audience two questions. First, did you know that the Supreme Court has been steadily expanding free-speech rights? Second, do you feel freer to speak now than you did five years ago? The answers are always the same \u2014 some variation of \u201cno\u201d and \u201check, no.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe first assertion is undoubtedly true. Federal courts have consistently protected free speech from government interference and have been relentless in shutting down viewpoint discrimination. When government officials target speech because of a speaker\u2019s views, they lose time and again.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, millions of Americans are extraordinarily reluctant to express even the most mainstream of (particularly) social conservative views. They\u2019re convinced that if they do that, they\u2019ll be publicly humiliated, investigated, and perhaps even lose their jobs. They\u2019re convinced that outspoken liberals enjoy greater opportunity in key sectors of the economy, and if conservatives want to thrive, they best keep their opinions to themselves.\u000a\u000aTwo recent incidents highlight this concern. The first comes courtesy of actress Lena Dunham, the paradigm of the celebrity social-justice warrior. Early last Thursday morning, she tweeted at American Airlines that she\u2019d heard two of its employees engaged in \u201ctransphobic\u201d talk. Specifically, she said she heard two flight attendants talk about how they thought transgenderism was \u201cgross,\u201d and they\u2019d \u201cnever accept a trans kid.\u201d She did not see them harassing anyone. She was simply eavesdropping on a conversation.

aVWhat would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders\u2019 vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation.\u000a\u000aAmong the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham\u2019s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America\u2019s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWilliams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse.\u000a\u000aAmerica in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders\u2019 original vision, to the principles and ideals of today\u2019s courageous modern day pioneers.

aVLess than a day after North Korea threatened that the United States would pay dearly \u201cthousands of times\u201d for pushing new sanctions to cripple the rogue nation's economy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News that America has the iron-clad upper hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a gut-punch to North Korea, to let them know the international community is tired of it and we\u2019re going to start fighting back,\u201d Haley told Dana Perino Monday on \u201cThe Story," in reference to the sweeping U.N. sanctions. \u201cEvery dollar of revenue that the North Korean government gets, they\u2019re not feeding their people with it. They\u2019re using it toward a nuclear weapons system. Going after these sanctions is going after their ability to build these missiles.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday voted unanimously to introduce a set of punishing sanctions that could cost the communist dictatorship some $1 billion off its $3 billion annual export revenue. The resolution, deemed the harshest since its first nuclear experiment in 2006, was payback for Pyongyang\u2019s testing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, which for the first time showed a capacity to hit the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only victory for Haley, who was one of the frontrunners in applying pressure to permanent members China and Russia to join them \u2013 rather than veto the resolution. She acknowledged that it was no easy feat, but remained confident that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s central trading partner \u2013 would fulfil its obligations and ensure the sanctions decree is upheld.\u000a\u000a\u201cNinety percent of the trade that North Korea has is with China. So that\u2019s why they were so important to this resolution,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cChina stepped up and said, we will follow through on these sanctions. And they encouraged the international community to follow it. When that missile test took off, they felt it in China. And they\u2019re disturbed enough to say that they now have to do their part.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aNorth Korea responded Monday with threats and backlash, seemingly suggesting that the dictator Kim Jong Un was doubling down on his objective of developing a nuclear-armed missile that could reach the continental U.S. Haley, however, maintained that \u201cwe are not going to run scared from them.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. SPY SATELLITES DETECT NORTH KOREA MOVING ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILES TO PATROL BOAT\u000a\u000aThe ambassador, who has made global human rights at the forefront of her positions since starting the job earlier this year, also characterized the chaos in Venezuela as \u201ctragic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are watching a democracy go directly into a dictatorship,\u201d Haley said, noting that an emergency hearing on the country in crisis was called two months ago after she proclaimed it a \u201cserious human rights\u201d concern.\u000a\u000aNORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS DESCRIBE CONCENTRATION CAMP, DAILY LIFE\u000a\u000aVenezuela has been in a state of conflict for months, with almost daily anti-government protests targeting iron-fisted President Nicolas Maduro have been engulfing through the increasingly impoverished country. The situation has deteriorated even further over the past few days since a controversial constituent assembly was sworn in on 4 August.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Security Council\u2019s response was that this should go to the Human Rights Council. The reason it hasn\u2019t gone to the Human Rights Council is because Venezuela is on the Human Rights Council,\u201d she added, indicating that the matter will likely need to return to the Security Council. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue sanctions, at least from the U.S. side, but we have to be loud about this.\u201d\u000a\u000aHaley said that North Korea is the largest \u201cthreat\u201d facing the United States at this point in time, but acknowledged the \u201clack of stability around the world.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t take your eye off of any part of the world,\u201d Haley said on Fox & Friends Tuesday. \u201cWe are anywhere and everywhere, which is what the United States Does.

aVBaby monitors have been around for decades, but a new one from Netgear debuted this year that may be one of the most advanced and user-friendly.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called the Arlo Baby, and among its features are a 1080p HD video camera, a lullaby player, a night light, a rechargeable battery and sensors that monitor air quality \u2014 all accessible anywhere, anytime on a smartphone, tablet or PC.\u000a\u000aArlo, known for its home security cameras, designed the device because it felt the ones on the market were technologically lacking, said Senior Product Marketing Manager Greg Falgiano, noting that millennial parents are "used to having access to all this information for other aspects of their lives. Now they can apply that to the baby as well."\u000a\u000aAWAIR SMART MONITORING DEVICE HELPS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY\u000a\u000aTo operate the monitor, users download the Arlo app, follow instructions to connect it to their Wi-Fi network and then hold their phone up in front of the monitor\u2019s camera until it chimes to indicate that the monitor and phone are linked. Everything is password-protected and has layers of encryption.\u000a\u000aThe Arlo Baby has a high-definition video camera that lets you watch your baby on your smartphone in crystal-clear, 1080p HD.\u000a\u000a"You can pitch and zoom on the screen\u2026[and] set the viewing angle of the camera\u2026.

Unlike other monitors that have glowing red lights that can disturb the child, the Arlo Baby has night-vision LED lights built into the front.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a speaker on the back that can play lullabies, many of which are included - others that can be downloaded. Parents can also record their own singing for the baby to listen to.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a night light that offers a host colors that can be changed, blended and adjusted for brightness and warmth.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aAnd there are air sensors that provide information about the baby's environment.\u000a\u000a"You can get the temperature [and]\u2026 the humidity of the room,\u201d Falgiano said. \u201cIt also has an air quality sensor so it lets you know if the room is too dusty, and it will link to recommendations to open a window, or \u2018needs more air flow.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of this is tracked in the app, too, so you can go back and see\u2026 How was the temperature over the last week? Or, was it really humid, and that's maybe why the baby wasn't sleeping well?"\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aEven the look of the device can be adjusted.

aVNot that long ago, you might have heard about an alarming concern with deodorant. People warned their friends through email and social media that these necessary antiperspirants cause breast cancer. Actually, some people even stopped using deodorant before this threat, such as Cameron Diaz who hasn\u2019t worn it in years! Before ditching your deodorant, though, you should understand the full story behind the concerns about deodorant and breast cancer.\u000a\u000aFirst, many people have worries about drugstore deodorants because of parabens. Recently, scientists performed a study which was published in the Journal of Applied Toxicology. The researchers took four samples of breast tissue from 40 women who had cancer. They found an interesting result.\u000a\u000aAfter analyzing the tissue, they found parabens in as many as 99 percent of the tissue samples. Even further, the scientists detected at least 5 parabens in 60 percent of the samples. In addition, some patients did experience breast cancer that formed in the armpit area while others did not.\u000a\u000aGETTING READY FOR COLLEGE? CONSIDER THESE VACCINES\u000a\u000aWith results such as these, you can see why both scientists and consumers are showing uncertainty. At the same time, this study doesn\u2019t clearly link the parabens as a cause of the breast cancer.\u000a\u000aSince the women experienced cancer in several locations, there also was no evidence that cancer resulted from paraben-containing deodorants. However, the results do warrant more research by scientists and health professionals.\u000a\u000aParabens: What Are They?\u000a\u000aEssentially, parabens are synthetic ingredients used in many personal care products and even foods. Companies favor them because parabens come with a low cost and act as a preservative that protects against mold and bacterial growth.\u000a\u000aBecause parabens can be absorbed through the skin, however, these ingredients can easily get into a person\u2019s bloodstream. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, researchers have found parabens in up to 99 percent of people in the US. Also, Scientific American states that up to 90 percent of common grocery products contain parabens, making it a hard synthetic to avoid.\u000a\u000aThe major reason for concern with these common ingredients is that parabens showcase weak estrogen-like qualities. Unbalanced levels of estrogen have shown to play a role in cancer, and parabens themselves may further cancer growth.\u000a\u000aIn one study, however, scientists actually grew breast cancer cells in a lab. Then, they combined parabens with another chemical to study the cancer\u2019s reaction.\u000a\u000aThey found that the cancer did indeed grow with the combined effect of parabens and another chemical. While the research does prove that parabens can fuel the growth of cancer under the right conditions, it still does not directly link them as a carcinogen.\u000a\u000aIS LIPOSUCTION SAFE FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES?\u000a\u000aIn defense, many health experts contend that the level of parabens in food and beauty products is too low to directly cause cancer. Furthermore, the research does not show that paraben-containing deodorants can increase the risk for breast cancer.\u000a\u000aHow You Should Respond\u000a\u000aSo what should you take away from this research? Consider this:\u000a\u000aIf you have no other concerns about using drugstore deodorant, you do not need to toss out your usual brand. People have been using paraben-containing deodorants for decades with no known damaging health effects.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, you could choose to avoid knowingly buying products with parabens as a safety net. One doctor from the Lankenau Medical Center in Pennsylvania, Marisa Weiss, MD, figures that it won\u2019t hurt anything to stay on the safe side. Weiss personally avoids products with parabens, keeping her products as natural as possible.\u000a\u000aWhile parabens are undergoing some scrutiny lately, studies have not found a direct link to the low levels of parabens in deodorant and breast cancer. In fact, many deodorants have stopped using parabens as an ingredient, reducing the cause for concern anyway. If you still have uncertainties, you can choose more natural deodorants to stay on the safe side.\u000a\u000aDr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

No other president has been able to do that.\u000a\u000aOn energy, the president has made America the dominant energy power. Oil and gas drilling permits speeded up. Fracking encouraged. It\u2019s America that holds the key to oil prices, not OPEC.\u000a\u000aIn Syria and Iraq, ISIS has seen its territory shrink by one third. The president said he would destroy ISIS. He's clearly making progress.\u000a\u000aOn North Korea, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has secured the most biting sanctions ever. And he's assembled a military force that\u2019s probably capable of shooting down NoKo missiles. Haven't seen that before...\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s not forget the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and legislation to make it easier to fire people at the Veterans Affairs Department.\u000a\u000aContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\u000a\u000aAnd one last one...since the inauguration, the value of stocks has gone up $2.3 trillion; since the election, $4.1 trillion. Since the inauguration, over one million new jobs [have been created].\u000a\u000aThe next time you hear that we have a do nothing Congress, nod your head in agreement.\u000a\u000aAnd the next time you hear President Trump has accomplished nothing, tell 'em to watch this show. We'll set 'em straight.

aVBy John Crudele, The New York Post\u000a\u000aIf The New York Times, the Washington Post and now ABC News aren\u2019t embarrassed yet, then there is no hope for what is called the Main Stream Media.\u000a\u000aAnother slew of e-mails the other day show how these news organizations tried their best to downplay a very suspicious meeting between Bill Clinton and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac at Phoenix in June 2016.\u000a\u000aThis was right in the middle of the FBI\u2019s investigation into the disappearance of Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails. Bill Clinton and Lynch said it was a chance meeting, where family matters were discussed.\u000a\u000aA few days later FBI director James Comey blasted Hillary\u2019s handling of her computers but recommended that she not be charged with any crimes.\u000a\u000aHillary has offered the same nonsensical explanation that Bill used when discussing the tarmac meeting \u2014 the missing emails were only about daughter Chelsea\u2019s wedding. And yoga.\u000a\u000aAgain, that\u2019s the Clintons\u2019 way of saying that Americans are stupid enough to believe anything.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m not a big defender of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aBut since the rest of the main stream media is spending all of its time focusing on what Trump and associates might have done in connection with Russia during the campaign I\u2019ve decided to tell you stories that the Times and Washington Post and almost all the other networks have decided to ignore.\u000a\u000aI started in my last column by explaining the terrorism threats that Washington is really focused on.

aVAmazon wants to deliver stuff to customers using drones, but it needs to to get the infrastructure in place first to have a chance of making it happen. As well as a large green light from the Federal Aviation Administration.\u000a\u000aWhile it's been making steady progress with the design of its Prime Air flying machine, it's also been filing numerous patents detailing ideas related to various aspects of its proposed delivery service.\u000a\u000aThey've included an extraordinary "beehive" drone tower that would operate in urban areas and manage multiple drones on delivery runs across the city. And how can we forget the wacky flying warehouse idea, essentially a blimp housing an Amazon warehouse and drone airport.\u000a\u000aThe latest Amazon idea to land on the desk of the United States Patent and Trademark Office is for a network of multi-purpose mobile facilities capable of maintaining drones and acting as a hub for deliveries. Interestingly, the facility would be located on trains, ships, and other kinds of vehicles, enabling its delivery drones to be rapidly deployed to areas where customer demand "is known or anticipated," whether through purchasing patterns "or events that are scheduled to occur in such areas."\u000a\u000aThe mobile units would be able to launch and receive drones while the vehicle is in motion, the patent filing said. A diagram (below) included in the submitted papers shows a shipping container with an open top and a drone hovering above it as the unit travels along a railroad.\u000a\u000aAmazon\u000a\u000aAmazon envisions such a facility being "loaded with replacement parts and/or inspection equipment, and configured to conduct repairs, servicing operations or inspections on aerial vehicles." Once a drone has been repaired or had its battery replaced, robots would be able to load it with a delivery and send it on its way.\u000a\u000aThe idea is similar in some ways to an Amazon patent that surfaced in 2016 showing how it could use street lights and the top of church steeples as docking stations for its drones, allowing the flying machines to stop off for a battery charge to allow it to cover greater distances on a delivery run.\u000a\u000aDrone deliveries from mobile units isn't a new idea either, as UPS has already tested such a service, although Amazon's plan seems rather more complex.\u000a\u000aIt should be noted that it's by no means certain Amazon's idea will ever see the light of day. Its grand drone delivery project is still in its early stages, though these patents do offer some insight into the company's thinking when it comes to building the infrastructure for any future sky-based delivery service.

Independent and special counsel investigations of the executive branch since Watergate often have. Mr. Mueller\u2019s recently reported impaneling of a grand jury in Washington does not guarantee that it will happen again, or even that anyone will be indicted. But it seems that the investigation is moving beyond questions of campaign collusion with Russia.\u000a\u000aThere has been a Russia investigation under way for more than a year, with no indication yet of a collusion crime, notwithstanding the leakiest period in presidential history. This is not to deny that the Russians have meddled in U.S. elections. Nor is it to say that persons associated with the Trump campaign might not possibly have committed offenses unrelated to collusion that merit prosecution. Such investigations may be beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s core jurisdiction, but the wording of his assignment lets him roam far beyond collusion issues.\u000a\u000aAs a practical matter, there is no firm, clear limit to the resources or time that can be devoted to special-counsel investigations. Nor is there an obvious limit on their scope.

aVA Texas professor is making waves on social media after protesting the state's campus carry law by wearing protective combat gear to class.\u000a\u000aSan Antonio College geography instructor Charles K. Smith went to his class last week sporting a camouflaged bulletproof vest and helmet. He said he wore it because he doesn\u2019t feel safe.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt definitely makes me feel uneasy that there are more firearms on campus than there should be,\u201d Smith told mySA.com. \u201c[Dressing this way] was just a statement on how I felt.\u201d\u000a\u000aCampus Carry, which was signed into state law in 2015 and officially implemented into Texas community colleges on Aug. 1, allows individuals with a conceal license to carry a handgun on college premises. The law went into effect at 4-year institutions in 2016.\u000a\u000aA photo of Smith wearing the combat gear was shared on Facebook, which generated a flurry of comments in favor of and against the professor.\u000a\u000a\u201cI realize students were carrying guns on campus illegally, but now it\u2019s legal to do so. It increases the chances of something happening,\u201d said Smith, who also acknowledged that no one had pulled a gun on him in his 10 years at the college.\u000a\u000a\u201cUsed to, when they got mad at me, they had to go home to get the gun and had time to cool off. Now they will have it with them,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aSmith said he\u2019s concerned about an argument breaking out and one of the participants having a gun.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy assumption is that you will have more people carrying guns \u2013 that will lead to problems. It always has,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing on this planet worth a human life.\u201d\u000a\u000aJames \u201cHot Mustard\u201d Velten, who posted the photo on Facebook, told Fox News on Tuesday that response on campus has been mostly positive.\u000a\u000a"Many professors admire his statement about campus carry," he said. "Many professors don't feel safe because of the law."\u000a\u000aVelten also told mySA.com that Smith was a passionate professor.\u000a\u000a\u201cAround people like that, you tend to listen a bit more,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSmith said his protest has nothing to do with San Antonio College, as they are following the law. He said he ran his plans by local police and the administration beforehand.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of them were okay and some of them weren\u2019t, but it's freedom of speech,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aLucia I.

People are not born that way.

aVBy Steve Cortes | Fox News\u000a\u000aThe song Chicago, made famous by Old Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, refers to Chicago as a \u201ctoddlin\u2019 town.\u201d Sadly today, thanks to decades of dreadful leadership, Chicago more resembles a \u201ctottering\u201d town, as in a place nearing collapse.\u000a\u000aLet me preface my indictment of Chicago and particularly Mayor Rahm Emanuel with the important disclaimer that I love this city and I\u2019ve raised a family here for two decades. If cut, I would bleed the orange and navy of the Monsters of the Midway, my beloved Chicago Bears.\u000a\u000aBut no amount of hometown affinity can color the reality of a city in systemic decline. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that from 2015 to 2016, Cook County \u2013 where Chicago is located \u2013 lost more people than any county in America. A U-Haul rental from Chicago to Texas can cost as much as six times more than the return trip, an indicator of the heavy outward flow of people. It\u2019s no wonder people vote with their feet and escape the endemic corruption, escalating taxes, and rampant crime. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly on Fox News, Chicago is certainly the most dangerous place in the developed world, with over 2,200 shooting already this year.\u000a\u000aSo what is Mayor Emanuel doing to address this migration out of our city? How is he ameliorating the mammoth $838 million property tax increase that\u2019s crushing disposable incomes in our city? Is he searching for solutions for the most under-funded pension system in America, obligations that will cripple our budget in just a few years? Is Rahm empowering police to stem the bloody carnage that afflicts the streets, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods?

aVTry as they might, the infection control specialists at Royal Brompton Hospital could not eradicate the invasive fungus that was attacking already gravely ill patients in the intensive care unit.\u000a\u000aEnhanced cleaning didn\u2019t stop the dangerous bug from spreading from one patient to the next in the 296-bed hospital. Neither did segregating infected patients, to keep them from spreading the fungus.\u000a\u000aEventually, officials who run the Royal Brompton, located a couple of miles from Buckingham Palace in London\u2019s tony Chelsea neighborhood, resorted to a last-ditch move no hospital ever wants to have to take. They temporarily shut their ICU. That appears to have put a stop to the more than year-long outbreak, which ended last year and which involved at least 50 patients.\u000a\u000aThe lengths to which the Royal Brompton was forced to resort to rid the hospital of Candida auris \u2014 a member of a broader fungal family named Candida \u2014 raised red flags for the small community of scientists who study fungi that infect people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey did the Cadillac of drastic actions to make that happen, which we generally wouldn\u2019t be doing for Candidal infections,\u201d Dr. Tom Chiller, the chief of mycotic \u2014 fungal \u2014 diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT in a recent interview.\u000a\u000aBACK TO SCHOOL: HOW TO AVOID SCABIES INFECTION IN CHILDREN\u000a\u000aThe fear is that that\u2019s what U.S. hospitals may be facing if C. auris breaches their infection control defenses. Last year at this time, the CDC knew of a single U.S. case, which occurred in 2013. As of mid-July, the case count had risen to 98 in nine states, though the lion\u2019s share have been reported by two \u2014 New York (68) and neighboring New Jersey (20).\u000a\u000aOn the ever-growing list of bad bugs, C. auris is one of the most unsettling. Dr. Anne Schuchat, who served as the CDC\u2019s acting director this spring, termed it a \u201ccatastrophic threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aSaid Chiller: \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for really sick people right now and we at CDC are taking a very aggressive approach to see if we can\u2019t control, contain, and even eradicate it from the places it exists.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut doing that won\u2019t be easy.\u000a\u000aMost fungal infections are acquired when a person picks up the fungus from the environment. But it seems C. auris can be transmitted from person to person, at least in a hospital setting. The fungus is hellishly difficult to eradicate from a space, once it settles in. And some versions of it seem to be impervious to the drugs \u2014 the dismayingly few drugs, it must be noted \u2014 that combat fungal infections.\u000a\u000aMore on this... She's got a radical approach for the age of superbugs: Don't fight infections. Learn to live with them external-ct\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s almost a perfect storm kind of organism. It has all the bad characteristics of a large number of bad pathogens,\u201d said Dr. Alex Kallen, a medical officer with the division of health care quality promotion at the CDC.\u000a\u000aThe resistant strains of the fungus seem to be as robust as the non-resistant strains \u2014 which is a disappointment and a concern. Often organisms that develop resistance pay a price; they are weakened in the process and don\u2019t spread as well. But with this fungus there is no \u201cfitness\u201d tradeoff for acquiring resistance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s again another scary thing about it. Because we don\u2019t want fit resistant organisms,\u201d Chiller said.\u000a\u000aNone of these dire characteristics was apparent when the fungus was first detected, in 2009. Then it was simply a new fungus grown from discharge swabbed out of the ear of a 70-year-old woman in a Japanese hospital.\u000a\u000aFinding new additions to the fungal family tree is not uncommon; nor is it considered alarming, generally speaking.\u000a\u000aBut then the radar pinged again. Some scientists in Pakistan were investigating puzzling bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients that they thought were caused by another type of yeast, called Saccharomyces. They shipped samples to Atlanta in the hopes the CDC could help. The culprit was actually C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat caught our attention,\u201d Chiller admitted. \u201cFor the first time we\u2019re like, \u2018Huh? Candida auris? A cluster that big in a hospital?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aOther countries started reporting cases. In fairly short order after the Japanese report, countries on three continents disclosed having seen infections caused by this fungus.\u000a\u000aThe widespread and virtually simultaneous appearances of C. auris raised suspicions that travelers were moving the fungus around \u2014 but that turned out not to be accurate. Comparing genetic sequences from various places showed different strains in each place \u2014 a phenomenon that remains a bit of a mystery. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s one thing,\u201d said Kallen, when asked how to explain the dissemination of the fungus.\u000a\u000aTo be clear, C. auris isn\u2019t the zombie apocalypse. Healthy people aren\u2019t going to be felled in the street by this fungus.\u000a\u000aIn fact, like lots of other pathogens, some of us carry Candida fungi on our skin \u2014 C. auris seems to especially like the warmth of armpits and the groin. As is true with other bugs, this fungus doesn\u2019t generally cause problems when it\u2019s on the outside of a healthy person being kept in check by other bugs with which it shares human turf.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s when someone gets sick that C. auris can become a problem. The fungus can infiltrate the bloodstream \u2014 wending its way into the body along a catheter or an intravenous line used to deliver fluids and medicines. When that happens, sick people become a lot sicker.\u000a\u000aWHAT IS 'LEAKY GUT' -- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT?\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that about five or six out of every 10 people that have been seen to be infected with C. auris die. Chiller cautioned, though, one cannot say the fungus kills 50 percent or 60 percent of its victims. As often is the case with secondary infections \u2014 bugs that infect people who are already fighting off another serious ailment \u2014 it can be tough to determine who died \u201cfrom\u201d the fungus, and in whom the infection merely contributed to the death.\u000a\u000aKeeping C. auris from getting into and spreading within hospitals is the big goal here. But it\u2019s likely to prove challenging. At the Royal Brompton, in London, doctors found that when a patient with C. auris was moved out of a hospital room, the next patient to move in would pick up the fungus. Even after cleaning, the fungus could be found on multiple surfaces \u2014 the bed, the floor \u2014 in the room.\u000a\u000aThe team of researchers there who investigated the outbreak declined requests for interviews.\u000a\u000aDr. Curtis Donskey, chief of infectious diseases at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, has been studying C. auris in the laboratory, trying to determine how long it can survive on surfaces in hospitals and which cleaning regimens can effectively destroy it.\u000a\u000aIn an upcoming paper, he and colleagues will report that the disinfectants most commonly used in U.S. hospitals are not that effective against this fungus.\u000a\u000aThey also found that C. auris is able to live on surfaces for at least seven days. And that is probably not the end of the C. auris story. \u201cWe certainly suspect that they would last longer than that,\u201d Donskey said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how long we tested.\u201d\u000a\u000aAware of this problem, the CDC has recommended hospitals use bleach to clean rooms that housed patients with C. auris. But that\u2019s not a fail-safe solution. \u201cWe found more of it on moist surfaces that are not typically cleaned with bleach at all,\u201d said Donskey, pointing to sink drains.\u000a\u000aAnd bleach isn\u2019t the easiest of cleaning regimens. \u201cIt\u2019s damaging, it doesn\u2019t smell good, causes occupational health issues,\u201d CDC\u2019s Kallen said.\u000a\u000aLikewise, there are surfaces hospitals might not think to clean between every patient that can harbor the bacteria \u2014 for instance, the privacy curtains that separate patients in a multi-bed room.\u000a\u000aAdopting the enhanced cleaning techniques used to control C. difficile \u2014 a bacteria that forms a spore and is also challenging to control \u2014 should help with C. auris, said Donskey.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s hoping, though, that the lessons hospitals learned as they battled that bacteria \u2014 for example, clean those privacy curtains after a patient with C. difficile is moved out of a room \u2014 will give them a head start in the era of C. auris.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the environment is much more appreciated now than it was a decade ago as a source for transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we would do the same things if we see Candida auris that we already are very well used to for trying to control C. diff and other pathogens.\u201d

Today, all you really need to lock and unlock your front door are vocal chords and a simple word: \u201cAlexa.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmazon Smart Home, the company\u2019s home security program, has been around since 2014, but only recently has it started working with voice recognition.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000a\u201cSmart Home is something that\u2019s been around for a long time,\u201d said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Smart Home at Amazon, \u201cbut it turned out that customers had to fish in their pocket to control their home. Pull out the remote control, find the appropriate app, find the right page in the app and click a button just to do something as simple as turning on a light.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow Amazon has moved to a different approach, one that emphasizes simplicity. Instead of pulling out your phone and tapping the screen several times, all you have to do is say, \u201cAlexa, unlock the door.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmazon now has hundreds of products that offer Alexa skills, and hundreds more are being added every month. Many of them are dedicated to home security, including smart locks like Dwelo and Kevo, which allow users to unlock their homes via voice command even when they\u2019re not near the door. Others, such as August Smart Lock, will lock the door too, when you tell Alexa your pin code. Amazon Echo also connects to home security systems such as Scout, Alarm.com and SimpliSafe. Some require paid plans to sync with Alexa, but one system, abode, has a no-fee plan that lets you tell Alexa to arm and disarm your system.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000aAnd then there\u2019s ADT, which was founded in 1874 but is hardly dated when it comes to technology. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, the company unveiled its new ADT Pulse skill for Alexa, which is free for ADT Pulse subscribers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was important to us that ADT was able to deliver a full suite of solutions to our customers through Alexa,\u201d said Adam Feigen, ADT\u2019s director of public relations and competitive intelligence. \u201cAmazon Echo and ADT have been natural extensions of the home for the past few years \u2014 ADT for over 140 years, really.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the ADT Pulse skill enabled, users can tell Alexa to arm and disarm their security system, check its status, turn interior and exterior lights on and off, lock and unlock specific doors or inquire about their status.

HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aOf course, you need one of Amazon\u2019s Alexa devices to handle your voice commands, ranging from the $49.99 Echo Dot to the $149.99 Amazon Tap and the $179.99 Echo. And now there\u2019s a new addition: the Echo Show ($229.99), which has a 7-inch screen that plays media, can be used for video calls and adds a visual element to Alexa-controlled home security. Ask Alexa to show you the front door or a child\u2019s bedroom, and Echo Show pulls up a live feed from a camera. \u201cWe use Echo Show at my home to make sure we understand who is coming in and out of the house,\u201d said Rausch.\u000a\u000aCurrently the Echo Show only works with home security cameras such as Arlo by NETGEAR and Ring video doorbells, but Amazon is adding to the list.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe see Alexa as the great simplifier in the home,\u201d said Rausch. \u201cYou can ask Alexa, \u2018Is my door locked?

This fact, coupled with the move to remove \u201cDonuts\u201d from signage at the new storefronts, has lead Quartz to speculate that the company is working to position itself as more of a direct alternative to Starbucks.\u000a\u000aHowever, the company insisted that the name \u201cDunkin\u2019\u201d is in keeping with the branding of the chain.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have been referring to ourselves simply as Dunkin\u2019 in our advertising for more than a decade, ever since we introduced our \u2018America Runs on Dunkin\u2019' campaign," the company wrote in its statement.\u000a\u000a"This test coincides with our company\u2019s plans to develop a new restaurant image designed to offer guests unparalleled convenience.

aVGeneral Motors has introduced a new small electric car with a price to match.\u000a\u000aThe two-seat E100 comes from GM\u2019s Chinese joint venture brand, Baojun, and costs around $5,300 after all of the local green car incentives are factored in. That\u2019s about a sixth of what a Chevrolet Bolt costs in the United States after its tax credit is deducted.\u000a\u000aRelated Image Expand / Collapse\u000a\u000aBut while GM has started importing some models made in China and plans to sell the Bolt there as a Buick, the E100 will not be making the reciprocal trip.

aVIf it weren\u2019t for his daughter, Ronald Ro, a San Francisco-based engineer, might still be working for Boeing or Samsung. And if it weren\u2019t for her dad, 6-year-old Jungsuh might still be struggling with her eczema.\u000a\u000aSeven years ago, Ro and his friend Kevin Cho, who has two sons with asthma, were frustrated with the air monitors on the market and set out to design a better one. In 2015 they launched Awair.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, the $199 Awair, with its minimalistic display and North American walnut case, looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired alarm clock. It gives you the time, but when you double-tap on the monitor, it displays the air quality scores in the room. There\u2019s also the $179 Awair Baby, designed for nurseries in Ocean blue or Baby Rose. The final product in the line, Awair Glow ($109), plugs directly into an outlet and could easily be mistaken for a nightlight made by Apple.\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: FOR CARS, THERE'S SAFETY IN CONNECTIVITY\u000a\u000a\u201cJust because there is technology within our products doesn\u2019t mean they need to look like technology,\u201d says Ro, who became Awair\u2019s CEO.\u000a\u000aBut what really distinguishes Awair from other air monitors is its empowerment capabilities.\u000a\u000aAccording to the American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air 2017 report, more than 40 percent of Americans \u2014 more than 125 million people \u2014 live in counties that have unhealthful levels of ozone or particle pollution. Dirty air exacerbated Ro\u2019s daughter\u2019s eczema and Cho\u2019s sons\u2019 asthma; it\u2019s the archenemy of people with allergies and chemical sensitivities; and it\u2019s been linked to sleeping problems and even death. According to 2014 World Health Organization estimates, polluted air is the cause of one out of every eight deaths in the world.\u000a\u000aCREEPS AND CRIMINALS, BEWARE! HAND-HELD 'DEFENDER 24/7' DEVICE TAKES PEPPER SPRAY TO THE NEXT LEVEL\u000a\u000aIndoor air can be five times as polluted as outdoor air, according to Awair, and people \u2014 whether they\u2019re in a hotel room that\u2019s been cleaned with harsh chemicals \u2026 or in a packed and poorly ventilated meeting room with rising levels of carbon dioxide \u2026 or in an older home with low-quality paint and carpeting that leaks chemicals into the air \u2014 often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re inhaling toxins.\u000a\u000aAwair monitors the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, chemicals and dust in a room, and when any of them reach unhealthy levels \u2014 indicated by a color code on the display \u2014 it notifies an app that recommends solutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe always jokingly say in the office, \u2018The only people who need Awair are those who breathe air,\u2019\u201d says Ro. \u201cMany people don\u2019t think about air because they don\u2019t see it, but the fact is that we wouldn\u2019t drink dirty water, but so many of us breathe dirty air.\u201d\u000a\u000aSMART & SAFE TECH: BLAZE LASERLIGHT MAKES CYCLISTS SAFER ON THE ROAD\u000a\u000aThe Awair app also provides tips and recommended courses of action from the Mayo Clinic. For example, it may suggest placing a peace lily, which removes airborne chemicals, in a bathroom with a high chemical score. Or it may recommend using 100 percent soy and beeswax candles, since conventional candles omit high levels of volatile organic compounds. It\u2019s also programmed to remind users to keep up on housekeeping, from laundering linens to wiping away dust.\u000a\u000aPeople who own the Awair Glow can even turn on heaters, air conditioners and humidifiers remotely when the app detects unhealthy air. \u201cWe\u2019ve received emails from users raving about how they connect their irons to it because they always forget to turn it off,\u201d says Ro. \u201cWe\u2019ve even heard about some people connecting their crock pots, which we can\u2019t promote, but we admire the creativity.\u201d\u000a\u000aAwair can connect over Wi-Fi to Alexa, Google Home, Nest and the IFTTT web service to automate the process of purifying your air, and it keeps a log of recordings so you can track air quality over time.\u000a\u000aMIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE\u000a\u000aRo says his team is still working on improving the user experience, adding that his team values feedback and is continually updating the tips to make sure users are comfortable with them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have accomplished much since we launched Awair in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cBut looking at the roadmap, one thing is clear: This is just the beginning.\u201d\u000a\u000aKatie Jackson is a travel writer.

aVFrom the bestselling team of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard comes Killing Reagan, a page-turning epic account of the career of President Ronald Reagan that tells the vivid story of his rise to power -- and the forces of evil that conspired to bring him down.\u000a\u000aJust two months into his presidency, Ronald Reagan lay near death after a gunman's bullet came within inches of his heart. His recovery was nothing short of remarkable -- or so it seemed. But Reagan was grievously injured, forcing him to encounter a challenge that few men ever face. Could he silently overcome his traumatic experience while at the same time carrying out the duties of the most powerful man in the world?\u000a\u000aTold in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton, Killing Reagan reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in the California governor's mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan's most heroic actions. In Killing Reagan, O'Reilly and Dugard take readers behind the scenes, creating an unforgettable portrait of a great man operating in violent times.

aVSeeing official-looking renders of the Galaxy Note 8 is nice, but now Samsung's new flagship is ready for its real close-up.\u000a\u000aThese new shots (first published by MyEverDayTech) seem to confirm both the good and the bad Galaxy Note 8 rumors that we've been hearing for weeks.\u000a\u000aOn the bright side, the Note 8's top and bottom bezels look just as thin as those of the Galaxy S8, and the back of the phone features dual camera lenses, which will enable optical zoom and other tricks.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the Note 8 in these photos also features a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. While we will reserve judgement until our in-depth review, this placement has proven awkward on the S8 and S8+. Fortunately, the flash in this case can act as a bit of a buffer.\u000a\u000aOther notes to take away from these images include a virtual home button (just like the S8 smartphones), and that the left and right edges of the handset appear to be less curved than previous Note handsets.\u000a\u000aWe expect to learn more about the Note 8 at a Samsung event slated for August 23, where the company is expected to reveal the flagship device.\u000a\u000aCredit: MyEveryDayTech via Android Police
