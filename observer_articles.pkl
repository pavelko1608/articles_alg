VSo imagine working on a road crew in the summer, driving around the state patching potholes and painting lines on highways. It has to be on of the roughest jobs out there, but your boss comes up to you and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job for you where you get to sit in the air conditioned truck cabin all day. All you have to do is drive slowly.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo then you say, \u201cSounds great. What\u2019s my truck doing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, it\u2019s really easy,\u201d your boss says. \u201cIt\u2019s just there to take the hit if a semi comes around the bend going 75 miles per hour and doesn\u2019t slow down as it approaches our road crew running about 60 miles per hour slower.\u201d\u000a\u000aDoes that seem like a crazy job? Maybe so, but this is real work that real human beings have in the real world. According to the Department of Transportation, work zone crashes have been on the rise, with more than 9,000 in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust in the last four years, there have been 26 incidents where a member of the traveling public struck a CDOT impact protection vehicle\u2014that\u2019s almost seven per year,\u201d Shailen Bhatt, CDOT\u2019s executive director, said in a press release. \u201cThis is a dangerously high number when you consider that in some instances, a CDOT employee is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle that was hit.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf ever a job were ripe to be stolen by a robot, this is one. Colorado recently demo\u2019ed a self-driving system built so that no human has to sit inside the truck built to absorb collisions. The truck mounted attenuator (also known as a crash truck) will very precisely follow a work zone vehicle. By running driverless, the robot crash truck protects people riding in the lead vehicle without putting any human beings in danger.\u000a\u000aColorado has released a video of the first public demonstration drive. The demonstration took place in Fort Collins (home of Colorado State), during a real operation where a road crew repainted lines on a segment of road while the crash truck followed along. The video is shot from above at a distance, so viewers can see the lines on the road getting brighter as the paint truck drives by. Inside the cab of the following truck, it\u2019s clear that there is no one in there.\u000a\u000aThe self-driving system has some other advantages over a human operator. It uses an extremely precise GPS system designed to match the lead vehicle\u2019s route within 4 inches. This is important because drives are insane people. As CDOT personnel explain in the video, when a following crash truck lets too much space open up between it and the working vehicle, drivers will sometimes slip in between them in order to pass both in oncoming traffic. Keeping that distance as tight as is safely feasible should discourage this behavior.\u000a\u000aSecond, in a collision, the truck needs to stop as quickly as possible. If it\u2019s hit hard, it\u2019s important that the brakes are applied quickly to help prevent it from slamming into the vehicle with the workers. A self-driving system will have better reaction times in such a situation than a human.\u000a\u000aThe truck is also equipped with camera and speed detection technology so it will have an accurate record of events leading up to any collisions. Crew in the lead vehicle also have access to data about the robot truck\u2019s performance and remote controls in case of emergency operations.\u000a\u000aWhen we spoke to CDOT for our recent investigation into rules around testing autonomous vehicles, a spokesperson expressed enthusiasm for the industry. EasyMile, one of the leaders in the autonomous trolley industry, set up its U.S. HQ in Denver this month, according to the Denver Post.\u000a\u000aColorado claims that this is the first live demonstration of one of the vehicles on an active road during a real operation. No details have been released yet about how many of these trucks are in operation in the state or a timeline for completely automating this role. The autonomous impact protection vehicle truck is a project of CDOT\u2019s technology project, RoadX. The truck was built in collaboration with Colas UK (which has been testing this technology), Royal Truck & Equipment (which built the truck), and Kratos Defense (which enabled autonomous functions).\u000a\u000aUp to this point, Kratos has specialized in building autonomous systems for combat situations in order to minimize risk for the armed forces. This is a new direction for the company, but the same principle applies: taking workers out of harms way.\u000a\u000aGood jobs are tough to come by, especially for blue collar workers, but this seems like one gig that everyone can agree is better taken off the payroll.

aVFinding Neverland is no easy enterprise in Sarah Ruhl\u2019s For Peter Pan on her 70th birthday. It begins in a kind of ground-bound reality\u2014in a hospital room in Davenport, Iowa\u2014where five quibbling siblings are doing a deathbed vigil for their dad.\u000a\u000aOnce the patriarch passes, all retreat to the family kitchen to drown their sorrows in shots of Jameson (as befits any self-respecting Irish Catholic wake), while the newly minted ghost roams his old homestead, reading the paper, feeding the dog, lazing about the house and, generally, making himself felt among his immediate survivors.\u000a\u000aThe first two-thirds of this 90-minute family drama, opening September 13 at Playwrights Horizons, is the children\u2019s hour. This is when the assembled mourners come to grips (tardily) with the reality that they are now officially orphans and will be the next wave of lemmings to roll off the cliff. Losing your parents, one of these off-springs wistfully observes, means \u201cThere\u2019s no one standing sentry between us and death.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith this event, all five finally reach adulthood, whether they like it or not. Along the way, they have taken baby steps in that direction. For one, growing up was getting to eat at the grown-ups\u2019 table at holiday gatherings, not at the children\u2019s card-table. For another (the medic among them), it was running to an emergency, not from it.\u000a\u000aBut one character, the sibling inspired by Ruhl\u2019s mom, Kathleen Kehoe Ruhl, was spared that little speed-bump to maturity, having played Peter Pan at the formative age of 15 in a Davenport Children\u2019s Theater production in 1955, so she never really grew up.\u000a\u000aRuhl\u2019s mother did go on to earn a Ph.D. in Language, Literacy and Rhetoric, but that first brush with theater opened a door to the stage that never closed for her\u2014or her daughter.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy mother,\u201d Ruhl confesses in her program notes, \u201cwas always someone who had an ambivalent relationship with the word \u2018grown-up,\u2019 and she\u2019s always stayed young, in the sense of being devoted, playful, and very much alive, in the theater.\u201d\u000a\u000aThus, the grateful playwright-daughter\u2014a two-time Pulitzer finalist for The Clean House and In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)\u2014has dashed off a little birthday present for Mommy and labeled it For Peter Pan on her 70th birthday. She has\u2014with a certain historical justification\u2014set the play\u2019s final third in Neverland and shaken the family tree to find characters who can put on a vest-pocket version of Peter Pan.\u000a\u000aJust as J. M. Barrie based his characters on the real-life family of British barrister Arthur Llewelyn Davies, Ruhl decided to draft the Kehoes into the play, interviewing her mother, her aunt and her three uncles for the project. \u201cThis was a very unusual process for me,\u201d she admits. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the characters in the play are direct representations of anyone in my family. It was more of an attempt for me to catch the kind of symphony of a family talking, everyone at once. While there might be characteristics some share, they\u2019re not exact one-to-one avatars of my own family.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer oldest and crankiest uncle turned into Captain Hook; the other two became the Darling boys, Michael and John; her aunt was the nest-making Wendy, and her mom gave in again to the wearing of the green. When her Peter Pan outfit is dragged out of an old trunk, the play shuffles off this mortal coil and heads straight for Neverland, where they all play-act Peter Pan to keep their grieving at a distance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe characters are still in the text labeled one through five. I think that was partly because birth order seemed important in this play. I wanted it to be about the whole family and how they spoke as individual characters. Once I tried to change the text back to their real names, but it didn\u2019t sit well with me so I went back to numbers.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs gifts go, this is one that keeps on giving. \u201cI gave the play to my mother just as a present of having written this world for her. I had no idea if she\u2019d ever want to play it. Of course, she did.\u201d Kathleen Ruhl starred in the second of the play\u2019s four incarnations in Chicago, where she is still active in theater and where the playwright grew up.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was such a wonderful experience for me, seeing her play herself. In a funny way, I feel I couldn\u2019t have finished the play until it was given birth to in that way.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that my mother and I have an unusual relationship. We have a mother-daughter relationship, but we\u2019ve also had an artist-to-artist relationship all my life. I think there\u2019s much more openness than in a lot of mother-daughter relationships.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter Chicago, this role of Ann\u2014the once and future Peter Pan\u2014went to a different Kathleen\u2014Kathleen Chalfant, who worked in Ruhl\u2019s Dead Man\u2019s Cellphone, Passion Play and Dear Elizabeth. \u201cI consider her something of a muse for me,\u201d Ruhl admits.\u000a\u000aThe herculean job of finding a Captain Hook to do proper battle with Peter Pan was resolved when her longtime collaborator, director Les Waters, signed up to bring the play in. \u201cThe minute I told him I was writing a play about Peter Pan, he said, \u2018Well, I know who\u2019ll be Hook: David Chandler. He\u2019s always wanted to play that role.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aRounding out this Grade-A cast are Lisa Emery, Keith Reddin and Daniel Jenkins.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t difficult for Ruhl to find the right setting for her play. \u201cI was at my grandfather\u2019s death vigil so I didn\u2019t have to think that much,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time, I was a very young writer so I wouldn\u2019t have made a play out of that. It was only later when I was thinking I really wanted to write a play for my mother for her 70th birthday as a gift that I started thinking about family and what it meant to be a grown-up. A huge turning point for my mother in growing up was in losing both her parents. I suppose it\u2019s unusual in this day and age to be present at the death of a family member, but it was a formative event for me and probably my mother, too.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen you think of Peter Pan, your first thoughts are usually of flying and crowing and dueling with dastardly villains, but it does have a melancholy undercurrent that worked for Ruhl\u2019s play. The boy who won\u2019t grow up is based on a boy who didn\u2019t grow up: Barrie\u2019s older brother, who slipped through the ice while skating and died.\u000a\u000aFor her purposes, Ruhl rephrased her situation in the form of a Japanese Noh drama. (She calls it \u201ca contemporary Midwestern Noh drama.\u201d) \u201cAs I understand it, it comes in three parts: a traveler meets a ghost, does not recognize the ghost, then recognizes the ghost and either dances with the ghost or embraces the ghost.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are a variety of ways you can take For Peter Pan on her 70th birthday, she believes. \u201cI think of it as a love letter to the theater about the fantasy that the theater affords us, how we can play with each other in a different way inside the theater than we can around a dining room table, but it is also about the deep bonds of family and about growing up. This is a depiction of a family that\u2019s not entirely pathologized. It\u2019s a family who can fight about politics and still love each other. It\u2019s rare for that kind of story to make it on the stage because we always have this idea that drama has to be about secrets and conflict. This is about the moment-to-moment experience of being with family and of letting a family member pass. When I watch this fine, fine group of actors be in the moment with that, it\u2019s very moving for me.\u201d

aVThese days it almost feels like politics is the only story that holds anyone\u2019s attention, so some of the biggest media brands are doubling down on the personalities that have defined Washington. Today at the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s podcast upfronts in New York City, a couple of new narrative political podcasts were previewed.\u000a\u000aFirst off, one of the NPR\u2019s most successful titles has been Embedded, a show that takes very deep dives into weighty topics. In its first season, it dug into stories that get overlooked, like the NBA\u2019s system of farm teams and the unusually high suicide rate in Greenland.\u000a\u000aTo kick off its new season, it is running five episodes on the biggest story in the world: the creation of Donald Trump. The series will debut on October 5. There\u2019s a trailer up now on the show\u2019s site.\u000a\u000aHost Kelly McEvers gave a preview of the series Thursday, focused in particular on The Apprentice and what it meant for expanding Trump\u2019s cult following into a force that could have a decisive impact on a national election.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a president who has no public voting record, no military record,\u201d McEvers said in a press release. \u201cBut what he does have is a somewhat public record of doing business, and a very public record on television.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the preview, she shared some tape from Bill Pruitt, a producer on the show\u2019s first two seasons. He talked about the ways that Trump\u2019s empire showed signs of decay even as they shot a show about how successful he\u2019s been. It was his job to edit that evidence out of the show. He described those little touch-ups as a \u201cconvenient vacation from the truth.\u201d\u000a\u000aTime, Inc. also showed off the reach of their many globally recognized magazine brands and their ventures in podcasting. In particular, it focused in on one of its own political offerings, but this one digging back into an ancient scandal from a nearly forgotten era.\u000a\u000aPeople will release a show focused specifically on the night in 1969 when Sen. Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge, surviving an accident that resulted in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne, called Chappaquiddick.\u000a\u000aLiz McNeil, the east coast editor of People Magazine explained that she became interested in the Kennedy\u2019s again after new tapes of John F. Kennedy\u2019s widow were released to the public after 50 years.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it made us realize that there\u2019s a lot we didn\u2019t know,\u201d McNeil said.\u000a\u000aWhile she had reported extensively on the Kennedy family, she hadn\u2019t done much on the late Senator. When she started reporting the story, she found the Kopechne family felt there was much more to say.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt turned out that they really felt like she\u2019d been overlooked,\u201d McNeil said.\u000a\u000aIn an era with so many scandals that the public can hardly follow one for more than a week or two, it might be interesting for political junkies to dive deep into a scandal that has held people\u2019s curiosity for almost half a century. In fact, this could be the kind of show that enables podcasters to start reaching an older audience that\u2019s largely resisted the new medium.\u000a\u000aPeople\u2019s show revisits an incident that most people think kept an extremely popular senator out of the White House, which is interesting to put alongside the first arc from Embedded, season two, about the rise of a man whose fame only seems to be fueled by scandal.

aVPrince George was one of the last young royals to start school this fall. By the time Thursday rolled around, all of the other small princes and princesses had already been photographed by their parents (or by a professional) to celebrate their first day of school, in all their awkward glory. The Netherlands\u2019 own Princess Alexia was spotted biking down her driveway in Converse and the Belgian royal family struck a pose with stuffed backpacks on. So how did Prince George\u2019s first day of school uniform reveal stack up?\u000a\u000aPrince George looked appalled at the very idea of starting school, approaching the Head of Lower School at Thomas\u2019s Battersea in London with fear in his eyes. Unlike the Danish Prince Vincent, PG was not spotted crying, although it looked like he definitely teared up at some portion of his drive to school. But who among us has not cried at the thought of doing homework nightly for the next decade?\u000a\u000aLike Prince George, Prince Vincent had a pretty rough time on his first day of school, tears and all. He perked up for a family photo, but otherwise looked entirely shellshocked. At least he was joining his siblings at school, while Prince George has to lead the way solo.\u000a\u000aLuckily, Prince George\u2019s uniform doesn\u2019t look all that different from his usual ensembles, but that might be why he wasn\u2019t completely comfortable. While these socks don\u2019t quite hit the knee, they sure are up there.\u000a\u000aTake a look at The Duke and Prince Harry on their first days of school \U0001f4da pic.twitter.com/RkL1MUbC4Q \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, his doting mother couldn\u2019t attend drop-off because of her debilitating morning sickness, which might have been one reason for the long face. Or it could be because he knows there\u2019s another sibling arriving shortly to steal his thunder. Maybe it\u2019s because his school uniform isn\u2019t quite as snazzy as his father and uncle\u2019s epic ensembles\u2014pageboy caps and blazers included. Hopefully by tomorrow he\u2019ll be smiling on his way to class, cap in hand.

aVCobie Smulders wants to know where she can rent an RV.\u000a\u000aThe actress, best known for her work on How I Met Your Mother, is currently making her Broadway debut in a revival of Noel Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. But on a recent Monday morning the statuesque brunette was looking ahead to July, when her run ends and she, her husband (Saturday Night Live alum Taran Killam, who\u2019s currently starring in Hamilton) and their two children (ages 2 and 7) head back to California.\u000a\u000aSmulders wants to make the cross-country journey in a trailer, but she\u2019s at a loss for where to begin\u2014until one of her stylists recommends a dealership in Weehawken, New Jersey, at which point Smulders says she\u2019ll \u201cget on that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old is no stranger to long road trips. Early in her acting career, she made an annual pilgrimage from her home in Vancouver to Los Angeles to try her luck during TV pilot season (which runs from November to March). She and her Canuck cohorts referred to the trip as the \u201cCanadian migration.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d work in restaurants all year long to make money, and then blow it for three months in L.A. while we were trying to get jobs,\u201d Smulders told the Observer during an interview at the Musket Room, a barn stable turned high-end restaurant in lower Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSmulders participated in theater clubs throughout elementary and high school, and she also briefly moved to New York to pursue her craft\u2014that\u2019s where she saw Rent and first dreamed of being on Broadway.\u000a\u000aBut it was those trips to L.A. that bore the most fruit. Indeed, during Smulders\u2019 third pilot season she landed her breakout role as TV reporter Robin Scherbatsky on How I Met Your Mother. The CBS sitcom debuted in 2005 and ran for nine seasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was one of those magical things that just kept going,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aAmong the most magical parts of it (at least for Smulders) was that her character had a pop star alter ego named Robin Sparkles, whose hits included \u201cLet\u2019s Go to the Mall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of the major complaints for long-running shows is that they become mundane,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cI never felt that way because of stuff like Robin Sparkles.\u201d\u000a\u000aOutside this fantasy world, Robin was the on-again, off-again love interest of both Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Indeed, in the series finale, after the titular mother dies, Ted\u2019s kids convince him to give his relationship with Robin another shot (she and Barney have married and divorced by this point).\u000a\u000aMany fans were disappointed in the way the series wrapped up, and while Smulders disagrees she\u2019s glad that people had strong opinions about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople were really emotionally invested in this show,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful way to end the time we spent together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmulders\u2019 fan base expanded from comedy fans to comic book fanboys when she was cast as badass S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (and Samuel L. Jackson sidekick) Maria Hill in the Avengers franchise. She met Joss Whedon (director of the first two films) through her Mother co-star Alyson Hannigan.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe humans aren\u2019t as interesting to watch in a battle, but Joss is kind and makes sure every actor has a moment,\u201d said Smulders, who will appear in next summer\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War.\u000a\u000aShe also made waves earlier this year after a mysterious cameo on the Netflix show Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2014the series cut away from the main action several times to show Smulders and Will Arnett handcuffed in the back of a van and exploring Peru, among other adventures. The couple\u2019s entire storyline turned out to be a red herring.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy character didn\u2019t die, so I have no idea what they\u2019re gonna do next season,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs such, Smulders is refocusing on comedy while she stars in Present Laughter, which opens April 5 at the St. James Theatre. And it\u2019s clear her comedic instincts are still strong from her sitcom days\u2014at one point during the photo shoot for this article, she started nibbling on a chili pepper that was sitting on the bar, a sight to make even the most hardened cynic chuckle.\u000a\u000aWhile this is Smulders\u2019 first time on Broadway, she\u2019s been a fan of Coward since the beginning of her career\u2014she performed scenes from his classic Private Lives in acting classes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love the way he uses comedy as a weapon,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aThe main sharpshooter in Present Laughter is Garry Essendine (played by Oscar and Tony winner Kevin Kline), a celebrated, self-absorbed actor with a voracious libido who\u2019s going through a midlife crisis. Throughout the play he negotiates comic conflicts with his wife, producer, director, secretary and servants, among others.\u000a\u000aSmulders plays Joanna Lyppiatt, who\u2019s married to Garry\u2019s producer but is also infatuated with Garry himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all feel like we can help him in some way or save him in some way or make his life better in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all want to be with him, and we think we know him, so it\u2019s a bit of a game trying to get into the inner circle of this world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaying the game with a formidable opponent like Kline keeps Smulders on her toes\u2014she described him as an \u201cidiot savant\u201d who takes comedy seriously.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe keeps changing and keeping things interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s like water: so fluid, going from one thing to the next. He\u2019s a true artist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same traits apply to Smulders herself, according to Present Laughter director Moritz von Stuelpnagel (a Tony nominee for helming Hand to God).\u000a\u000a\u201cCobie was built for the theater,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cShe\u2019s thoughtful about storytelling and precise in her comedy. It\u2019s been a real joy to watch her take a character that might otherwise descend into a flat archetype and have her flesh the role out with dynamic humanity.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Coward\u2019s fast-paced writing style is similar to the patter on sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother, Smulders said sustaining that rhythm for almost three hours presented a new challenge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing in a 15 minute scene is unlike anything you have to do on film or TV,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Broadway grind of rehearsals and performances has also had an impact on Smulders\u2019 home life, especially since her spouse is in the same boat\u2014Killam is playing King George III in Hamilton through April 13.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously there\u2019s a little bit of a \u2018Who\u2019s getting up first to take care of the kids\u2019 type of situation,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cBut aside from the lack of sleep, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019re together in ways that we haven\u2019t been before.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe and Killam meet for dinner together on two show days. Smulders admitted she takes advantage of the fact that her future RV partner is in Broadway\u2019s biggest hit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s a part of it, and by association I feel like I\u2019m a part of it, but maybe that\u2019s just me being greedy,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGreed aside, Smulders said that her time in New York had been \u201ca dream\u201d thus far.\u000a\u000a\u201cI keep fooling people into giving me jobs, and now I\u2019m on Broadway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always something I\u2019ve wanted to be a part of, and I can\u2019t believe that this is the experience I\u2019m having.\u201d

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tweets have influenced government policy and led to countless hours of pundit head-scratching. And now, they\u2019ll be on Broadway.\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Post, the upcoming Broadway play The Parisian Woman will be updated weekly to reference Trump\u2019s tweets. Playwright Beau Willimon, who also created the Netflix hit House of Cards, reportedly wants the play to be as up-to-date as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s going to be writing as everything with Trump unfolds,\u201d a source told the Post.\u000a\u000aThis focus on current events makes sense since The Parisian Woman, like House of Cards, focuses on Washington\u2019s corridors of power. Oscar nominee Uma Thurman plays Chloe, a powerful D.C. socialite who puts pressure on her lover to get her husband a high-level government job. Chloe comes to terms with her marriage, her past, and an uncertain political future over the play\u2019s 90 minutes.\u000a\u000aThe Parisian Woman begins performances November 7 at the Hudson Theatre. Josh Lucas, Phillipa Soo, Blair Brown and Marton Csokas also star.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first Broadway show to grapple with Trump\u2019s presidency. A stage adaption of George Orwell\u2019s 1984 (ironically playing at the same theater through October 8) examines themes like government censorship, which have become increasingly relevant in the age of \u201calternative facts.\u201d Orwell\u2019s book has also resurfaced on bestseller lists since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u000a\u000aMore Broadway productions are also incorporating social media, with varying degrees of success. Dear Evan Hansen, a Tony-winning musical set in a modern day high school, projects text messages, Facebook statuses and YouTube videos onstage to bring its audience inside the internet. The effect works like a charm.\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, a desperate online campaign to get feline meme Grumpy Cat to appear in the Broadway revival of Cats failed miserably. The show is closing on December 30.\u000a\u000aIt remains to be seen whether the Parisian Woman gambit will be a cool way to stay current, or just a desperate Cats-like ploy.

aVThe long term prognosis is bad, but the short term is worse. The two headlines dominating the news are the ever-increasing risk of nuclear war with North Korea and the evidence of climate change\u2019s devastating effects in Hurricane Harvey. Sure, there are steps we can take to mitigate each\u2014such as remembering the consequences next time we vote and doing everything we can to curtail our carbon emissions\u2014but, as individuals, there isn\u2019t a lot we can do to meaningfully reduce the threat of extinction.\u000a\u000aOther than hiding under the covers, how are we to cope with the existential threat of the end of the world? We probably can\u2019t\u2014our intellect isn\u2019t sophisticated enough. But we can use our anxiety to remind us to do all the things we should be doing anyway.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that nuclear war with North Korea will break out and life as we know it ends in an instant. It\u2019s also possible you get hit by a bus this afternoon because you were crossing 23rd Street while texting and wondering if it\u2019s time to wear a fall jacket. It\u2019s possible that humans continue to emit more CO2 than the atmosphere can afford, in which case the \u201conce every 500 years\u201d storms become monthly occurrences. It\u2019s also possible your appendix bursts after lunch today.\u000a\u000aWe have no idea when or how our lives will end. If we knew for sure, most of us would change our behavior considerably. We would spend more time with our loved ones and less time complaining about them. We would let go of grudges. We would worry less about our pocketbook and more about our psyche. We would worry less about what other people think and more about making the most of our precious time on Earth.\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t go hugging everyone if Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump decides they really mean it. (I tried this recently on the 6 train, and I don\u2019t recommend it.) And don\u2019t quit your job to follow your passion \u2014unless it can pay the monthly minimum on your Visa. The end may not be so imminent that your savings and love of Phoenician literature will meet your earthly needs.\u000a\u000aBut the threats we live with should prompt us to ask some questions: Am I spending my time wisely? Am I happy with my life? Am I proud of myself? Am I doing the things I always wanted or am I procrastinating? Do the things I\u2019m working matter to me or am I working to impress other people?\u000a\u000aIf there\u2019s any silver lining to the literal and metaphorical clouds hanging over our heads, it\u2019s perspective. No, most of us can\u2019t do anything to avoid war with North Korea and we can\u2019t singlehandedly change the course of global warming and climate change. But we can change the way we think.\u000a\u000aHumanity has navigated tough crises before and odds are we will again. But if the end is here\u2014or even if the odds of the end are just a little higher\u2014we should use it as an opportunity to make changes that will make us happier.\u000a\u000aWorst case scenario, we\u2019re more at peace in our final moments. Best case scenario, we\u2019re more at peace over the next several decades. We can\u2019t control the world, but we can control our behavior and our outlook. And maybe that\u2019s enough.\u000a\u000aBradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Holdings, the parent company of Tusk Strategies, Tusk Ventures, Kronos Archives, the Ivory Gaming Group and Tusk Montgomery Philanthropies.

aVIn Julian Schnabel: A Private Portrait, Schnabel is either talking or people close to him are talking about him. On a larger screen than his own large canvases, the artist paints, revisits his journey from Texas to New York, recalls the 1980s, dives off a high platform into the Mediterranean and paints some more.\u000a\u000aThe film is a cinematic portrait that features archival footage and is directed by Pappi Corsicato, a filmmaker whose work spans profiles of Richard Serra and investigations into the ruined city of Pompeii. Schnabel, who is credited as an executive producer, says there\u2019s no special reason why the film premiered last week at the Tribeca Film Festival and will open Friday at the Quad in Manhattan.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe the reason why it\u2019s coming out now is because it\u2019s finished now,\u201d said Schnabel, 65, sitting at a table with Corsicato in the skyscraper office of Cohen Media, a film distribution company founded by the real estate tycoon Charles Cohen, owner and renovator of the Quad.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to make a movie about me. What was important was that the work was shown. It\u2019s not trying to show something that\u2019s spectacular, but at least you can get a sense of the scale of the work,\u201d said Schnabel, who wore a warm-up jacket with a reproduction of one of his paintings on the back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI sort of feel like I\u2019m a broken vase, and that he picked up the pieces and put the vase together as best he could,\u201d he said, speaking about Corsicato. That\u2019s high praise from a man who has broken his share of plates.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a biography,\u201d said Schnabel, who told me he never intended to make a self-portrait on film. \u201cBut my father said to me, when I made a film about Jean-Michel Basquiat, that I should have made it about myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked Schnabel what he said to his father after that suggestion.\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018It\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u2019 \u201d he remembered saying.\u000a\u000aSchnabel also noted that he originally hadn\u2019t intended to make the film about Basquiat either. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a movie director,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when Jean-Michel died, a Polish movie director came to interview me about Jean-Michel. His name was Lech Majewski, and he had a pretty encyclopedic knowledge of film. But he was a tourist, and I knew Jean-Michel so well and I knew what the world was. I think one of the problems with movie-making is that people don\u2019t know their topic.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorsicato, a Neapolitan who knew Schnabel before he spent two years making the documentary, set his sights high when it came to making a documentary about the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s my vision of Julian\u2019s life. It\u2019s my personal point of view. It\u2019s like a story that you see in a movie. It\u2019s like a classic movie. In the beginning I was inspired by Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane, the little kid who becomes grand\u2014but from an artistic point of view. It\u2019s really like an American dream,\u201d he said in heavily accented English.\u000a\u000aI asked whether Corsicato saw Schnabel as Orson Welles or Charles Foster Kane.\u000a\u000aSchnabel spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe it\u2019s even more of a Fitzcarraldo kind of character, in the sense of what makes you do something that is ultimately illogical, like going to Sevilla and filling an abandoned monastery with paintings,\u201d Schnabel said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I do know is that history is a lie,\u201d Schnabel declared. \u201cEverybody has their version of history.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were there and they were there, and it\u2019s amazing how different their perception is of an event that occurred, but that\u2019s their truth,\u201d Schnabel said, looking at Corsicato. \u201cSomebody else would make a very different film. When he says that this is a private portrait, I would say that it\u2019s private to him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThroughout the film, family and friends recall Schnabel breaking rules and being true to his own creative spirit. Not a critical word is spoken, yet some recollections may come as a surprise. Jeff Koons, a contemporary, discusses how Schnabel helped him sell his first work of art.\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess it was nice that he said that. That\u2019s true, and I also got him his first exhibition,\u201d said Schnabel. \u201cWhen I first came to New York, nobody really helped me. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought it was good to help other people. It was pretty tough. Nobody really liked young artists in the \u201970s. I supported other artists, and I still do.\u201d\u000a\u000aTough times indeed. Shadowman, another documentary that revisits the 1980s art scene, made its world premiere at Tribeca and was runner-up for the festival\u2019s audience award. The subject is Richard Hambleton, whose graffiti daubs of threatening figures on the corners of buildings got him more attention than Keith Haring or Basquiat in the early 1980s. Hambleton, who attended his premiere in a wheelchair with a mask covering his cancer-ravaged face, struggled with drug addiction, then and now, and would disappear from public view for years at a time. In the film, Hambleton laments that, \u201cat least Basquiat died. I was alive when I died, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Hambleton story brought Schnabel back to the theme of success in the art market. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about apples and oranges. It depends on what you make,\u201d Schnabel noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many different lives,\u201d said Schnabel, who has made two films in his career about artists who died young: Basquiat and the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (Before Night Falls). \u201cLook, Vito Acconci died last night. Was Vito Acconci a successful artist? I would say he was. Was he a household name? Plenty of people who you talk to won\u2019t know who he was. But I can tell you how important he was,\u201d said Schnabel.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can look at an [Anselm] Kiefer painting which is very large, and people can understand why you might buy one of those and hang it in your house. But what about a Fat Chair by Joseph Beuys, which generated what Kiefer does?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same kind of marketability, because it\u2019s a peculiar object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeuys was a seminal influence for many artists\u2014Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Binky Palermo\u2014who were all his students. Yet when he died, his obituary might have said, \u2018the greatest artist on the north side of the street in Dusseldorf,\u2019 \u201d Schnabel added.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo many people around us have died\u2014Lou [Reed], David Bowie, and now Jonathan Demme. It\u2019s a death sentence being born. But what do you make out of it?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cSo if someone says that Keith [Haring], died and Jean-Michel died\u2014and it\u2019s certainly why his paintings got so expensive\u2014I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the answer to say, \u2018I\u2019d rather die before I get old,\u2019 like in the punk rock song.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked if he would be making another film of his own. The artist responded with the name of yet another artist who died young. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something about Vincent van Gogh. I\u2019m working with Jean-Claude Carriere,\u201d he said. Carriere, the veteran screenwriter, is one of many friends interviewed in Corsicato\u2019s documentary.\u000a\u000aVan Gogh\u2019s myth is securely in place, but I mentioned to Schnabel that Before Night Falls, his portrait of a martyr to Castro and to AIDS, is responsible for making Reinaldo Arenas and his poetry known to a far greater public than if the film had never been made.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping to do,\u201d he said, looking across the table at Corsicato, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s what this film will do for me.\u201d

aV\u201cI\u2019ve just recently found out that my husband of 30 years has been unfaithful with several different women over the last few years. I\u2019ve been financially dependent on him since I was 24 and he\u2019s always been a loving and good husband,\u201d a new client tells me.\u000a\u000a\u201cDid this come as a shock to you? Did you know the relationship was in danger?\u201d I ask her.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, it\u2019s for sure broken my heart, and yet surprisingly freed me at the same time,\u201d she replied. \u201cI realized that for many years I\u2019ve been unhappy and missing something from our relationship. He\u2019s a good man, but in the past I\u2019ve felt the need to run away\u2014almost as if I wanted a new life.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not wrong to want something new; it\u2019s wrong to not listen to that inner guidance.\u000a\u000aYour intuition always knows what\u2019s right for you\u2014but in this day and age, we just aren\u2019t accustomed to listening to that instinctual voice. Your emotions tell you everything you need to know about what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong for you. So, in essence, how you feel is everything. When you feel happy or inspired, and you feel as if you are growing, expanding and being challenged, while at the same time loved, appreciated and supported, you are in the right relationship. For now, that is. It could always change.\u000a\u000aIf on the other hand, when you feel stuck or depressed, and you feel neglected or like you\u2019re not being seen\u2014or if you simply feel you are not connecting anymore or experiencing joy when you spend time together\u2014then it might be time to revisit your partnership.\u000a\u000aYour emotions are always guiding you along your life\u2019s path, but that path might be different from the one you\u2019re currently on.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust because you pick a path at 27 years old, doesn\u2019t mean that you are meant to be on that path forever, \u201c I tell her. \u201cThat path is only as useful to you as its ability to support your growth.\u201d\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re human, it\u2019s possible to outgrow your path. It would be wonderful to be on a path that continues to support you as you grow and evolve, but not every path is set up that way. Some paths are destined to continue throughout your life while others are shorter-term\u2014their sole purpose is to walk you over a bridge to someone or something waiting on the other side.\u000a\u000aNot every relationship is meant to be in your life forever.\u000a\u000aThe best relationships are not necessarily the ones that last forever, they are the ones that teach you the most about yourself and then they gently (or maybe not so gently) coax you to move on with your life.\u000a\u000aYou can only hold onto something that you\u2019ve outlived for so long before the universe will take it away from you.\u000a\u000aYou can voluntarily stay in a dead-end marriage and experience all the unhappy, unsatisfied emotions that go along with it, but don\u2019t expect the universe to comply with your deconstructive pattern. If it\u2019s not in your best interest to continue coupling with your partner then the universe will arrange convenient circumstances in which to help you separate.\u000a\u000a\u201cUncovering your husband\u2019s numerous affairs was the universe\u2019s way of giving you the opportunity to pick a new direction for yourself,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI have no doubt that your marriage was the perfect path for you at a certain stage of your life, but if you\u2019ve been feeling the need for change for awhile, the universe has given you the perfect out,\u201d I say to her. \u201cWhat will you do with it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I am honest with myself, I feel that it\u2019s time\u2014I feel that the universe is freeing me to find something better, however I\u2019m terrified to walk forward alone,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aStay if it feels like growth; leave if it feels stuck or worse\u2014if it feels like you\u2019re going backwards.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that\u2019s important for you is to allow yourself to continually grow and evolve as a human being. If you can do that within the context of your current relationship, have at it. If not, it might be time to explore other options.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t stay out of fear.\u000a\u000aFear is a bottomless pit\u2014it will keep you stuck in situations that you\u2019ve long outgrown in your life. Fear believes that the devil you know is better than the one you don\u2019t. But that devil won\u2019t take you very far in life\u2014if you sell your soul to him, he will send you straight to your own self-imposed hell and you\u2019ll have no one to blame but yourself.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t fear being alone. Fear being trapped in a relationship that\u2019s not meeting your needs.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s always better to be alone than to be in a relationship that has outlived its purpose. When you\u2019re alone, you can live your life on your terms. It might seem scary at first to realize what those terms are, but once you define them, you\u2019ll find a sense of purpose and fulfillment that only you can provide yourself. Relying on someone else to provide that fulfillment will always take away your sense of self and purpose. Everyday you spend in the wrong relationship is another day you lose your identity to it.\u000a\u000aYou are not selfish for ending a marriage. You are selfish for holding onto it for the wrong reasons.\u000a\u000aA marriage might give you financial security and material comfort, but that is not a reason to stay in it. If you know you are in a marriage that is no longer serving you, it is most likely not serving your partner either. You are not obligated to stay in a relationship that has outlived its purpose; you\u2019re obligated to honor the relationship and honor the highest outcome for both partners\u2014and sometimes the highest outcome for both is to separate to allow for new growth and experiences.\u000a\u000aA relationship isn\u2019t good because it lasts a lifetime. A relationship is good if it gives you the wisdom of a lifetime.\u000a\u000aA good marriage isn\u2019t one that stands the test of time; it\u2019s one that challenges you, puts up a mirror to your insecurities and fears and subsequently breaks your heart open so it can hold more love. A good marriage makes you a better person and more often than not it makes you a better person for another partner.\u000a\u000aBased in New York City, Donnalynn is the Author of \u201cLife Lessons, Everything You Ever Wished You Had Learned in Kindergarten.\u201d She is also a Certified Intuitive Life Coach, Inspirational Blogger (etherealwellness.wordpress.com), writer and speaker.

aVUnlike amateur President Donald Trump, Congressman Adam Schiff speaks coherently and uses measured words, complete sentences and whole thoughts.\u000a\u000aAll week on TV, the California Democrat has discussed Russian espionage in the 2016 election in favor of Trump. Schiff is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several investigations of Trump, Russia and possible collusion.\u000a\u000aOn CNN, Schiff told Wolf Blitzer Wednesday that \u201creal estate is a convenient way to launder money.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump, you night remember, is a super-savvy real estate wheeler-dealer. Big-league! One of the biggest in New York. One of the biggest in the world! This he can tell you. Unbelievable! Believe him. Trump even tried for a deal to build a Trump castle in Moscow while campaigning for President! He kept it secret until recently. And listen to Schiff.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf there was a time when the Trump organization found it difficult to borrow from banks and responsible financial institutions and it had to turn elsewhere and there was a marrying of interests between the Trump organization and the Russians who have historically needed to launder huge amounts of money and they did business together in that way, that is far more compromising that any salacious video would be,\u201d Schiff said.\u000a\u000aThe \u201csalacious video\u201d Schiff referenced pertains to an unproven allegation about Trump in a dossier compiled against him by a former British spy. (Steele. Chris Steele). It alleged that Russian spies have a video of Trump with Russian prostitutes in a hotel room in Moscow. Urination, reportedly, is involved.\u000a\u000aSchiff downplayed the negative effects of such a video\u2014even if one were to exist\u2014because, Schiff said, Trump was elected despite undisputed audio recordings of Trump bragging about how he likes to grab sexy women by the crotch. It\u2019s his way of saying hello.\u000a\u000aGrabbing money, of course, is another matter. Schiff wants to know more about real estate, Russian money and Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, in our national interest, we need to make sure\u2014did this happen?\u201d Schiff said. \u201cDid it not happen? If it did, it means the Russians have continuing leverage over the president of the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne wonders whether Schiff\u2019s committee\u2014or any of the investigators\u2014are looking into Trump\u2019s 2004 real estate deal in which he bought a Florida mansion for $41 million and sold it four years later for $95 million to a Russian oligarch who never moved in.\u000a\u000aSchiff stopped in this week on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball with Chris Matthews on Tuesday and on Morning Joe on Thursday. On MoJo, he discussed Devin Nunes, another California representative and also a Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\u000a\u000aAlthough Nunes supposedly recused himself from the Russia investigation last spring after a clumsy attempt to lobby for Trump, Nunes recently barged back into the Russia mess with subpoenas to the Department of Justice and the FBI for information about the dossier and how it came about.\u000a\u000aIt appears that Nunes is again acting on behalf of Trump to disrupt the investigation and create false sideshows to distract.\u000a\u000a\u201cI find it inexplicable that the chair continues to try to exercise this authority,\u201d Schiff told MoJo panelist Mike Barnicle.\u000a\u000aBARNICLE: \u201cSo, you have a runaway chair?\u201d\u000a\u000aSCHIFF: \u201cWell, in this case, yes, we do.\u201d\u000a\u000aHAND ME THE REMOTE . . .\u000a\u000aTucker Carlson might have inadvertently said something honest on Wednesday when speaking on Fox News Channel with Brit Hume on Tucker Carlson Tonight about Trump\u2019s growing reluctance to inflict deportation on 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d of Latin-American descent who came to the U.S. as children. Sighing heavily and pounding his fist lightly on a table, Carlson snarled, \u201cA lot of hysteria has been wasted.\u201d Carlson is one of Fox\u2019s leading hate-mongers toward immigrants, portraying them as criminals and moochers\u2026\u000a\u000aMore in line with Carlson\u2019s reactionary backlash is Republican Congressman Dave Brat of Virginia, home of Robert E. Lee. Brat fumed to Chuck Todd on MSNBC\u2019s Meet the Press Thursday about DACA and how Trump seems to be bending to public opinion. Brat referred to a \u201cwelfare state\u201d and warned that Dreamers would bring in \u201ctheir entire extended family\u201d and that could mean three or four million people. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna work,\u201d this folksy fella said. He added, \u201cHealth care\u2019s blowin\u2019 up through the roof.\u201d He\u2019s a member of the \u201cFreedom Caucus,\u201d a cabal of right-wing Republicans whose gang name implies that any opponents must be against \u201cfreedom\u201d\u2026\u000a\u000aLate Thursday morning, MSNBC showed video of what the view looks like from an airplane that is flying through a hurricane, like Irma, which now threatens Florida. Anchor Stephanie Ruhle began to excitedly describe what you hear. \u201cIt sounds like screaming witches,\u201d she said. Might have been nice if they played such sound with the video\u2026\u000a\u000aOn Your World with Neil Cavuto on Fox on Thursday, Seth Kaplan, the managing editor of Airline Weekly, tried to explain airline price-gouging against customers trying to flee the storm in Florida. \u201cA few empty seats were the ones that got the headlines, the $3,000 tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real story here, Neil, is there just aren\u2019t nearly enough seats for everybody that wants to get out of Florida.\u201d Actually, Seth, that\u2019s only part of the story. The \u201creal story\u201d here is that airline algorithms are designed to squeeze more money from higher demand and that leads to automated price-gouging\u2026

aVMany of my fellow liberals suffer from what I like to call \u201cThe West Wing Syndrome.\u201d The left has long been in love with the fictional president Jed Bartlet and the notion that the smartest person available can become the nation\u2019s chief executive.\u000a\u000aPerhaps we can be forgiven for clinging to this idealistic, Hollywood version of politics that bears little resemblance to reality.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, most of the time the smartest, most qualified person isn\u2019t a very good politician. It\u2019s fine and well to pine for a nation led by the most qualified man or woman, but if that person doesn\u2019t have the political chops to win a national election, their qualifications are irrelevant.\u000a\u000aInvariably, whenever I make this observation, I am accused of being willing to accept an unqualified candidate just for the sake of winning. This is not true. I think certainly there should be a minimum level of qualifications for any person who would like to lead the world\u2019s most powerful nation. But I am willing to accept that the candidate who can actually win may not be the most brilliant or most experienced person available.\u000a\u000aThere has recently been some buzz about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his national tour that gives every appearance of an exploratory presidential campaign. The left\u2019s reaction has generally been one of horror: Zuckerberg is just another billionaire businessman, who is no more qualified for the presidency than Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m currently undecided on a Zuckerberg candidacy, but I do think Democrats need to think outside the box when they\u2019re deciding how to take on a celebrity who used his 100 percent name recognition to claim the nation\u2019s highest office. As I previously put it, the next Democratic nominee needs to be closer to a Kardashian than a Klobuchar. It\u2019s not the way most people would prefer it to be, but this is our reality. The public, which is largely cynical about government and constantly expressing its desire for an \u201coutsider\u201d with \u201cauthenticity,\u201d is not likely to warm to an ancient senator who\u2019s been in Washington so long that he won\u2019t answer a question about what he had for breakfast without poll-testing it.\u000a\u000aDemocrats in particular are going to have a difficult time getting a gray-haired creature of Washington to the presidency, in part because the left is less reliable and harder to please than the right. Those on the left, particularly younger voters, won\u2019t turn out if they aren\u2019t excited by their nominee, as the 2016 election demonstrated. Polling consistently finds that non-voters, when they express a preference, typically favor Democrats by large margins. In short, Democrats leave a lot more votes on the table than Republicans do. Team Blue\u2019s task is harder, and it is imperative for the Democratic candidate to create excitement.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve seen what happens when Democrats nominate a \u201crsum candidate\u201d\u2014a bland, reliable person with impeccable qualifications and decades of experience. The three most recent cases in point: Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. In the end, their experience, intelligence and impressive laundry lists of qualifications did not prevent them from losing to candidates they clearly bested on all of those counts. The fact that Gore and Clinton both won the popular vote is cold comfort for Democrats, because under our system, the popular vote winner is irrelevant. Both of them lost the all-important electoral vote because too much of their unenthusiastic base stayed home or cast a throwaway third-party vote.\u000a\u000aThe tendency of the Democratic Party to underperform unless it offers a fresh, young, exciting candidate is nothing new. Except Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, vice presidents who both succeeded to the Oval Office when presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy died in office, when was the last time the Democratic Party won the presidency with a traditional candidate?\u000a\u000aYou would have to go back to James Buchanan in 1856 for that one. He was the last Democratic career politician in his 60s to win the presidency. Otherwise (again, except Truman and Johnson), no Democrat has won the office in the last 160 years who was older than 56 when first elected, and only two (Kennedy and Bill Clinton) served more than four years as either a governor or senator.\u000a\u000aIn short, there is a formula for Democrats who win the presidency: They are in their mid-50s or younger and aren\u2019t weighed down by a long career in Washington, D.C. Every time Democrats have departed from this formula in the last century and a half, they have lost.\u000a\u000aGiven this history, and the tendency of young liberals to vote only when sufficiently excited, Democrats would do well to stop pining away for the most qualified and experienced candidate and instead focus on the segment of the Venn diagram where \u201cqualified\u201d and \u201cfresh face\u201d intersect. This is where the party found Barack Obama in 2008. Here\u2019s a thought: look in that direction again and give up your dreams of a Solomonesque silver knight. If Democrats try to ride another old warhorse in 2020, they will gallop off once again to their electoral doom. And this country can\u2019t afford another trip to the glue factory.\u000a\u000aCliston Brown is a communications executive and political analyst in the San Francisco Bay Area who previously served as director of communications to a longtime Democratic Representative in Washington, D.C.

aVIn Alabama, the Democratic candidate to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 vacant Senate seat is receiving little help from the national party. Politico reported on September 1, \u201cWhile Jones would seem to be a perfect candidate for the post-Charlottesville moment\u2014he\u2019s a 63-year-old former U.S. attorney who prosecuted the pair behind the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham\u2014national Democrats have largely ignored him.\u201d The article cited that several Democrat-leaning organizations, like Daily Kos and the End Citizens United PAC, that supported special election congressional candidate Jon Ossoff in June 2017 have refrained from supporting Jones.\u000a\u000aA similar trend is taking hold nationwide. Despite DNC Chair Tom Perez\u2018s promises of developing a 50 State Strategy, the national Democratic Party is continuing its abandonment of regions that have historically voted for Republicans. Sen. Bernie Sanders and progressives have filled this void in many parts of the country, boosting special election congressional candidates in Kansas and Montana earlier this year who received little support from the national Democratic Party. But Democrats can\u2019t expect progressives to pick up the slack for the entire party, which faces an uphill battle in recouping the enormous losses incurred under the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aIn a Florida special election for State Assembly in a district that Hillary Clinton won, Republicans have poured cash and resources into four different candidates. Only one Democratic candidate has emerged, and he has received virtually no support from the state or national Democratic Party. The Orlando Sentinel reported, \u201cThis, my friends, is why Democrats are chronic losers in this state\u2026 because they don\u2019t compete.\u201d Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide election in Florida since Sen. Bill Nelson won his 2012 election, and in 2018 he faces a tough re-election battle\u2014even though Florida has more registered Democrats than Republicans. Democrats\u2019 solution was to elect a billionaire donor, Stephen Bittel, to run the State Democratic Party. In his first year in office, he faced calls for his resignation after he accused prominent black elected officials of using the \u201crace card.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn April 2017, a race in Wisconsin for a 10-year term to the State Supreme Court went uncontested by Democrats.\u000a\u000aIn Alaska, Democrats recently suffered a set back when Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott announced he would be running for re-election in 2018 as an independent with incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, who Democrats in the state supported in 2014.\u000a\u000aOhio Democrats have complained about how disconnected the national Democratic Party is from the rest of the country. The Washington Post reported in April 2017, \u201cIn more than a dozen interviews, party leaders across Ohio\u2014from local precinct captains to the handful of Democrats who remain in Congress\u2014said they are deeply worried.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Democratic Party can\u2019t expect to be perceived as the party of the people while they won\u2019t bother to try to represent people in areas of the country they\u2019ve written off as Republican territory. Allowing Republicans to go unchallenged in states where they have been traditionally dominant allows them to dedicate their resources on competitive areas. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argued that sometimes it is best to stay out of elections, which directly contradicts the 50 State Strategy promise: \u201cThere are just certain races where it is not helpful to be attached to the national D.C. Democrats. It is the calculation you make in even the most competitive swing district,\u201d Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told the Huffington Post in April 2017.\u000a\u000aThis statement is reminiscent of the Clinton campaign\u2019s mistake of ignoring Wisconsin and Michigan during the 2016 election. By assuming that some areas of the country are foregone conclusions, Democrats dig their own grave with apathy and hopelessness. Unfortunately for Democrats, voters have taken notice.

aVIf you\u2019ve ever been to the McKittrick Hotel, the site of Punchdrunk\u2019s immersive theater (and mandatory stop for visiting relatives) Sleep No More, you know it can get creepy at night. But even on an afternoon this summer\u2014empty of all Eyes Wide Shut masks, bellhops lip-syncing to Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d or impromptu nude dance sequence in blood baths\u2014the McKittrick still has a looming, menacing presence. Or maybe I was just nervous. After all, I was there to meet Sigourney Weaver, and a dark, semi-abandoned haunted house might have been the wrong call. Why couldn\u2019t I have picked a well-lit coffee shop to interview the star of all the Aliens and Ghostbusters?\u000a\u000aIf I was skittish, Weaver, already posing for photos when I tentatively tiptoed into an empty bar area, seemed entirely at ease. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget, they have my meat in the freezer,\u201d Weaver reminded no one in particular between poses. \u201cI really can\u2019t forget to take the meat with me when I go.\u201d Directly following our interview, Weaver would be driving back to the Adirondacks, and the possibility of leaving the meat (never clarified as to how much there was of it, or what kind) was causing her more anxiety than a Hitchcockian faux-tel. Weaver\u201468 years old and 6 feet tall without heels\u2014can make herself at home in even the most inhospitable of environments.\u000a\u000aThe notion that Sigourney Weaver is the embodiment of the \u201cDIY and take no shit\u201d authority figure for a generation of young women might sound, in retrospect, like a backhanded compliment. But for those of us who grew up as tomboys in the 80s, Weaver stood as shining beacon of some other way to be. While other girls wanted to be Princess Leia or Jasmine, there were always a few of us who wanted to be Ripley. Or later on, Katharine Parker in Working Girl, a woman so ahead of her time in office politicking that she managed to mash-up Claire Underwood from House of Cards and Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, a solid two decades before either existed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect time to be different,\u201d Weaver tells me on the topic of beauty standards, as we slide into a dark and quiet booth in the red-curtained bar room. \u201cI think it\u2019s our time.\u201d She notes her obsession with watching the Olympics. \u201cYou see the glorious range of what women look like, how strong they are. I think this is all changing on screen, as people want to see themselves reflected a little bit more. They don\u2019t want to see some little stick figure up there all the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat inspired me in the beginning was that Vanessa Redgrave was my height,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee, I guess if they want you, they must want your height.\u2019 Realistically, it protected me from being in more prosaic films, because I was never the little girlfriend. I didn\u2019t get to do a lot of love stories, which I think I would have enjoyed. Mostly I did other kinds of movies and other kinds of stories, partly because I was too tall for traditional roles. So it was really these crazy kind of directors who would look at me and say, \u2018You can do this!\u2019 Sometimes it would even be a man\u2019s role. That I didn\u2019t fit into the traditional mold, I think that\u2019s made my career much more interesting, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, that untraditional mold encompasses more than just Weaver\u2019s height and muscle tone. Born in Manhattan as Susan Alexandra Weaver (she renamed herself \u201cSigourney\u201d in 1965, basing it on a small character from The Great Gatsby) to an actress mother and a TV-producing father, Weaver spent her early years attending a series of private and prep schools before turning 18, when she promptly left for Israel and joined a Kibbutz for several months. When she came back to the states, she attended both Sarah Lawrence and Stanford University. She chalks up a lot of her success to the fact that she was an English major in her undergrad years. \u201cAt Stanford, they had a drama department, which I kind of assiduously avoided, because it did very square things. I joined this group called The Company, and we did outrageous new plays. We did commedia dell\u2019arte in a covered wagon and wandered around the Bay Area. A lot of Shakespeare.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough increasingly comfortable outside mainstream theater culture\u2014for a period of time at Stanford, Weaver dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house\u2014the actress did eventually audition for Yale\u2019s prestigious drama graduate program. She showed up to her appointment in a long sheet, tied off with a belt made out of rope, and proceeded to knit together three speeches from Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Saint Joan of the Stockyards. (One day, I would like to produce a line of dolls and accessories for children based on Sigourney Weaver. Not her in character, just Sigourney: She\u2019ll come with her own toga and tree house and well-worn copy of Threepenny Opera, but the car with a trunk carrying a month\u2019s worth of ice-packed sirloin is sold separately.)\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually had a difficult time [at Yale], because they took everything so seriously,\u201d Weaver recalls. \u201cThey gave you your own dressing room. It seemed so lonely to me. Everyone was so competitive. I thought, I really miss my friends, and having everyone do their makeup up in the same little piece of cracked mirror in the back of someone\u2019s truck.\u201d Weaver had to wait until she\u2019d graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1974 before she could recover her sense of community by performing in Off-Broadway shows.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, many of the films Weaver works on tend to have directors that cultivate a similar comrade-in-arms mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re illegitimate films,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201cBut for instance, I just worked with Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie), and we just did this crazy film in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was nothing you\u2019ve heard of. But it was really cool, like his version of a student film. It was really guerrilla filmmaking. It was two takes and move on. I just love working that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater, I will crosscheck her name with Blomkamp\u2019s to see what \u201chis version of a student film\u201d looks like. The movie turns out to be Alien 5.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s surprising to hear Sigourney Weaver talk about her legacy as a feminist movie icon. For beginners, she doesn\u2019t like to think of herself as a genre actress, even though she\u2019s associated with so many tough-as-nails sci-fi heroines.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think genres are very misleading,\u201d she says, almost reproachfully. \u201cRemember, I was an English major, so it was always about the story for me. I never cared what the role was, whether it was big or small.\u201d Same goes for movie franchises: Though she\u2019s a part of the culture, she holds herself at a distance from the Hollywood machine that churns out reboots, sequels and spinoffs with alarming frequency.\u000a\u000a\u2018All good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u2019\u2014 Sigourney Weaver\u000a\u000a\u201cSee, I\u2019m from the very old world, where setting out to make a franchise is a very bad idea,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think when you start off from the idea of a movie being part of a franchise, you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You have to start with one really good script and really good characters. Women have probably suffered, because people have tried to do the franchise thing. You have to find a role, that, whether played by a man or a woman, would be a really compelling character.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat said, Weaver is now attached to another Aliens film along with the upcoming Avatar sequels. \u201cLook, franchises have to be earned,\u201d she stresses. \u201cI know a lot of agents are telling young people nowadays to attach themselves to one. In the old days, that\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019d want, to be locked into a contract like that, for just one role. I\u2019m sure young people are just trying to be in movies. But sometimes even a little tiny movie can go around the world. And then, you see, you can have more of a say in it, should your little movie become a franchise. But first, you need to have a really great writer. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be put together by Hollywood people, adding a little this and that. I just don\u2019t think that works.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver is equally dismissive of the American film industry writ large. \u201cI never really feel like I went to Hollywood,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when I did actually go there, for a film like Ghostbusters, which was a big film by Universal, it was really our story that we were telling, and it felt like it belonged to us.\u201d On the opposite end of the spectrum from the work she\u2019s most well known for are some of her favorite roles, in underrated films like Scott Elliott\u2019s A Map of the World. Or 2006\u2019s Snow Cake, where she got to play opposite Alan Rickman. \u201cOften, when you sell a film to Harvey Weinstein and it\u2019s good,\u201d\u2014Weaver lets down her polished persona for a moment in a flash of teeth that could as easily be a puckish smile as a conspiratorial grimace\u2014\u201che just doesn\u2019t distribute it.\u201d\u000a\u000aEither way, Weaver figures, the old model of movies is on its way to extinction. \u201cThe Hollywood thing is going to be a dinosaur very soon.\u201d People are making and distributing movies on leaner budgets, and releasing them online, without the help of a major studio for distribution. \u201cIt\u2019s already happening, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver\u2019s latest role is in A Monster Calls, which is itself a pretty uncategorizable genre-blend. Ostensibly a kid\u2019s movie (though it\u2019s hard to imagine what child could walk out of the film without being traumatized) based on the \u201clow fantasy\u201d novel by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls takes the messaging of a John Green story and dresses it up in the psychedelic, phantasmagorical guise of a Heavenly Creatures or Pan\u2019s Labyrinth. Liam Neeson is the voice of a talking tree monster that is not Groot, though you could be forgiven for confusing the two. The titular tree monster is summoned to help a young boy Conor (Lewis MacDougall) deal with the impending death of his young mother. (A truly emaciated Felicity Jones, who we can at least agree is having a much better time in this holiday\u2019s other blockbuster escapist hit, Rogue One.) Weaver plays Conor\u2019s British grandmother, a woman who takes the concept of \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d a little too far. When Conor is forced to come live with her, we see that his grandmother has taken the same approach toward interior design: her living room filled with breakable knickknacks and irreplaceable family heirlooms. When Conor, in a fit of fantasy rage (portrayed in beautiful watercolor animation, to differentiate it from the \u201creal\u201d world) reduces the room to shards and splinters, he only has a moment to savor his destruction before hearing the key in the lock. Grandmother\u2019s home.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a testament to both the nuance of the character and Weaver\u2019s portrayal of her that the scene feels like it lasts a lifetime. Without saying a word, Weaver\u2019s eyes widen and waver as she daintily crunches through the wreckage until she comes to the one piece of furniture left untouched. Only then does she bare her teeth and let\u2019s us see the big bad wolf inside, howling in wordless rage and frustration as she deals out the fatal blow to the literal and metaphorical semblance of structure in her life. Then, still mute, she leaves the room, never once looking at Conor, who is screaming apologies and excuses all the while.\u000a\u000aLater, the boy will hear her sobbing in the bathroom, the door locked.\u000a\u000aDespite holding her own no less formidable opponents as ghosts, extraterrestrial slime monsters and even Jennifer Love Hewitt (Heartbreakers, anyone?), there\u2019s something so primal that Weaver tapped into when confronted by the young boy\u2019s outburst. In that moment, I didn\u2019t know if I was terrified of Weaver\u2019s grandmother or for her. The scariest possibility? Probably both.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly? I end up doing a lot of big movies, and I so wanted to do something very small and intimate and very dramatic,\u201d says Weaver on her decision to take the part, adding that she had been interested in working with director J.A. Bayona after seeing two of his films, The Orphanage and The Impossible. \u201cThe story really catches at your heart,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s not a film about cancer but about coming to terms with loss. I just knew Bayona would create something very original and so personal.\u201d\u000a\u000aSigourney Weaver is in a rush to get back upstate, so I remind her to take her frozen meat before asking her my one super-fan question: Did she ever find movies that she starred in too scary?\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, often!\u201d She laughs. \u201cWatching the Alien movies\u2026when you\u2019re on set, acting, you don\u2019t realize the sounds they are going to be adding later. It really does a number on you, when you\u2019re watching it as an audience member.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my scariest role?\u201d Weaver pauses. \u201cMy character in Copycat was completely nuts.\u201d This was her turn as an agoraphobic psychologist in Jon Amiel\u2019s 1995 psychological thriller. (Surprisingly, as I found out, not based on a Thomas Harris novel!) Sigourney Weaver, a.k.a. Ripley, a.k.a. one of the toughest women in the biz, stands up and shudders. \u201cThat woman? She just scared the hell out of me.\u201d

aVChristopher Meloni would like to say he\u2019s sorry. Not to me, per se, sitting across from him in an airy loft above NoHo\u2019s cobblestoned Bond Street, but to his 233,000 Twitter followers, mostly. Maybe a little bit to 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Snatched, in which the actor appears briefly but memorably. Possibly, in a more roundabout, elliptical sort of way, he\u2019s even saying sorry to Snatched co-stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn. \u201cI find it very difficult to stay on point with all the promotion that I should be doing,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cI want to sit here right now and say I do apologize for being distracted at times with the magnitude of the horror that is this administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the Trump Administration, by the way, as in comma Donald. As in current President of the United States / former host of The Apprentice. As in the man who fired FBI Director James Comey just 24 hours after Meloni and I met to discuss a funny little comedy in which he plays a wannabe Indiana Jones-type named Roger. But if you want your \u201ccelebrities, they\u2019re just like us!\u201d moment, understand that Chris Meloni is having that relatable issue focusing on his work, on his art, on the comedy of it all when he feels that every refresh of the Twitter page brings Mad Max: Fury Road one step closer to becoming a documentary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve found this administration, and their stance not only on institutions but facts and numbers, is an outright attack on truth. Which, with every autocrat and in any dystopian novel, that\u2019s rule number one,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cThat there are still followers, I find that very dangerous. And that the attack from people who agree with the administration is to paint it as an \u2018us vs them\u2019 situation. Especially us, the libtards, the Hollywood libtards.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom the moment Meloni noted that he \u201cwoke up in a George Orwell novel today,\u201d the actor has been an active, outspoken and occasionally shirtless voice of #resistance. \u201cThe message\u2014which I\u2019m very poor at conveying, I\u2019ll be the first to admit\u2014is that the fight is not \u2018us vs them,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe fight is not against anything. It\u2019s for truth. And you have to agree on the truth. You can have debates on it, but you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aHe trails off, gazing at his hands. After all, he is here to promote Snatched, not a revolution. Finally, he looks up. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny the science of something like climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeloni\u2019s eyes, more like two storm clouds somehow bored into a rock face, have a way of making simple phrases like \u201cyou just can\u2019t\u201d sound very much like a universally acknowledged fact taught in schools across the nation. Of course I\u2019m not going to argue. If any actor has to keep an eye (or two) on our politicians, maybe it should be Chris Meloni.\u000a\u000aActually, we should probably talk about the eyes. Have you ever had Chris Meloni squint at you? It\u2019s terrifying, it really is. It\u2019s the squint that served him so well over 12 seasons and 273 episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Elliot Stabler. It\u2019s the gaze that\u2014and this is a compliment\u2014makes his August Pullman such an effectively enigmatic bounty hunter on WGN America\u2019s slave-era drama, Underground. Hell, it\u2019s the haunted stare of Meloni\u2019s psychotic yet oddly tender Chris Keller I still remember most from HBO\u2019s groundbreaking prison piece, Oz.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had that since I was a child,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a look, a certain stare. It\u2019s not cultivated, it just is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFunny enough, it\u2019s that look, the certain stare that allows Meloni to move so fluidly, and so often between drama and comedy. Keep his simmering intensity and simply change the context, and suddenly he\u2019s Roger in Snatched, exuding the confidence of Indiana Jones while displaying the skill-set of your local Sports Authority\u2019s junior manager. Or, if you will, suddenly he\u2019s Gene in 2001\u2019s summer-camp comedy Wet Hot American Summer\u2014David Wain\u2019s veritable who\u2019s who of comedy icons, A-listers and award-winners while they were all anything but\u2014the PTSD-ridden Vietnam veteran who also just so happens to be sexually attracted to refrigerators and prone to conversations with a talking can of vegetables (voiced by Archer\u2018s H. Jon Benjamin to boot).\u000a\u000aIn person, Meloni occupies that unique space between comedy and drama near-constantly. He lives in it, probably pays rent. I wondered for a while before this interview what kind of person I\u2019d be speaking to; intense or silly? The slave-catcher or the faux-adventurer? The horror show that was his Oz character, or the freak show that was, well, his Freakshow from Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle? The simplest answer is that he\u2019s both, simultaneously. He jokes, loud and often; when a member of his team requests some tunes, the actor puts on Manchester-based pop-rock band The 1975, a suggestion from his 16-year-old daughter. And yet whenever these endearing moments of levity do come up, Meloni\u2019s smile never quite un-arches those interrogation room eyebrows. It\u2019s not a surprise, then, that the method he describes for choosing his next project is an internal one, almost a zen process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, the spirit moves you,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe soul starts to need a different way to express itself. Whether you\u2019re immersed in comedy and suddenly you want to check out a drama, or if you\u2019ve been living in drama you might need a release valve. I\u2019m led by how I feel.\u201d\u000a\u000aRecently, the spirit led Meloni into the director\u2019s chair for only the second time in his career, when he helmed the season 2 episode of Underground, \u201cAuld Acquaintances.\u201d It was a far cry from his first effort\u2014a co-directing credit on National Lampoon\u2019s Dirty Movie in 2011\u2014that required, but was not limited to, blowing up a house, working around lead actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell\u2019s real-life pregnancy, and a lengthy, half-drunk monologue from his own character. \u201cAs an actor I\u2019m just concerned about me, my point of view vis-a-vi all the other actors and the moment,\u201d he says, then leans forward as if sharing a secret. \u201cAs a director, you have to be aware of everything.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re aware of the scene that happened before, while envisioning the scene after, and where this particular moment resonates, plus where each character\u2019s journey goes from here,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen you have to negotiate that, because maybe your idea doesn\u2019t sit with their idea. You have to make decisions on everything. How big do you want the bottle to be, what\u2019s the gun size? Is there a rug or isn\u2019t there a rug? You have to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page, and the page is your vision. Where to set up the camera, when that camera moves, how that camera moves.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy the expansion into directing? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s always that thought of \u2018Once I\u2019m done with this project, I\u2019m technically unemployed.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aClassic case of actor\u2019s dilemma, yes, but Meloni is set for the near-future at least. As part of the latest of what seems like many brand reboots, the SyFy network ordered a pilot for Happy!, adapted from Grant Morrison\u2019s graphic novel. Meloni will star as ex-cop turned mafia hitman Nick Sax, who gets his life back on track with the help of a tiny, blue winged horse voiced by Saturday Night Live\u2018s Bobby Moynihan.\u000a\u000aWhich is great news for fans of a dead-eyed Chris Meloni speaking to imaginary friends. In June, the actor also reprises his Wet Hot role for Netflix\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later (set a decade after the 2001 original, and acting as a follow-up to Netflix\u2019s surprisingly ingenious First Day of Camp). \u201cIt\u2019s all set. All in the can. Ready to roll,\u201d Meloni says on the status of the Wet Hot sequel, but is genuinely tight-lipped about where we will find the appliance-loving Gene.\u000a\u000aThe actor takes a long pause, then finally tells me \u201cGene is a solitary figure leading a life of mystery. He\u2019s trying to get his act together. He\u2019s finding a purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it wasn\u2019t plot-points that brought Meloni back to Camp Firewood in the first place. 10 Years Later reunites the cast\u2014loaded with names like Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd\u2014as well as original creators David Wain and Michael Showalter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know those guys. I trust their sensibilities so much, know their work ethic,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cThey have such a command of the material that it\u2019s really a no-brainer for me. I tell people all the time, it\u2019s like going home again.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe sits up straight then, coming to a much, much more appropriate analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to camp,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get to play with all your old friends.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt that, I swear, his eyes almost soften. Almost.

aVYou\u2019ve heard the advertisements, and you\u2019ve read the news reports. Sign up for a credit monitoring service and you\u2019ll be protected from corporate database hacks like the massive one that hit credit reporting company Equifax this summer\u2014news of which broke yesterday.\u000a\u000aIt does sound good. After all, knowing when somebody else tries to do something with your personal data is a good thing, right?\u000a\u000aIt is, but by the time your personal data has been compromised\u2014like it was for almost 150 million Americans who had Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, birth dates and addresses exposed in the Equifax hack\u2014you\u2019ve already missed your best opportunity to protect yourself. And the vast majority of credit monitoring services don\u2019t really provide you with protection where you\u2019re most vulnerable. They also can get you a false sense of security.\u000a\u000aSo what is credit monitoring? For a monthly fee, one of the monitoring companies will scan your credit file and let you know if they see any suspicious transactions. If you made them, you\u2019re good to go. If you didn\u2019t, you can start the process of fighting identity theft.\u000a\u000aBut you only have certain kinds of protections based on the monitoring you get\u2014and you might not even have much protection at all. The best monitoring programs watch for activity through all three of the major credit bureaus, while others (including most of the free or low-cost ones) usually monitor just one. Note that Equifax is offering free monitoring for all Americans for one year, but only through their bureau. But no matter what kind of credit monitoring you have, it does nothing to tell you about (or stop) fraud from happening on accounts you\u2019ve already opened.\u000a\u000aFor example, a credit-monitoring service would warn you that somebody opened a new credit card with your personal information, but it wouldn\u2019t tell you that somebody ripped off the electronic data in the credit card you already have and was using it to make purchases. Monitoring also doesn\u2019t track fraud outside some very specific parameters. If a crook uses your Social Security number but with a different name or address, you usually won\u2019t be notified.\u000a\u000aYour goal should be to do a much better job protecting your data before you become a victim, and locking down access in places where thieves could find a way in. You can do that yourself, without the help and expense of a credit monitoring service\u2014and give yourself real peace of mind instead of relying on somebody else.\u000a\u000a1. Start by requesting your credit report from each of the three credit bureaus: TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. Stagger the requests so that you\u2019re doing one every four months, which will give you a very good top-level view of your credit. One important thing to keep in mind is that the reports you get from each of the bureaus this way are informational\u2014not the actual ones lenders use when considering you for a loan or line of credit. These ones usually only go back two years, while the real-deal reports evaluate seven years of your credit life.\u000a\u000a2. Make a plan for reviewing every bill that comes into your house, either by mail or through email. When you get credit card or mortgage statements, medical bills or other sensitive material, review it carefully to check for errors and then shred it.\u000a\u000a3. Be much more aware of email security. The easiest way for a data thief to take control of your identity is to get in through your email. He or she can then change passwords at will, and get in through the front door, so to speak. Make sure you have two-factor authentication\u2014a password and some other form of verification\u2014set up on every account.\u000a\u000aThe Equifax hack is a particularly bad one because the giant credit reporting company has personal information on virtually every American consumer in its files. If you applied for a credit card or loan, your information is in there\u2014and about half of Equifax\u2019s data was exposed. You can go to EquifaxSecurity2017.com to check and see if your information has been compromised, but it wont be clear until much farther down the line just how many people will be victimized due to this hack. The data thieves had access to the information all summer, and now that the theft has been publicized, they\u2019ll likely wait things out until the free monitoring period is over in a year.\u000a\u000aAs a part of their response to the hack, Equifax is offering credit monitoring to anyone in its database, but how much trust do you want to put in that now? You need to be using your own tools.\u000a\u000aThe most powerful one? A total credit freeze. It takes time and some back-and-forth with the three credit bureaus, but for a small fee, you can completely restrict access to your credit report. Nobody will be able to open credit in your name, or even check your report to offer you a deal on a credit card. You\u2019ll have to manage the freeze manually, and lift it when you actually need to apply for a credit card or loan, but with it in place you\u2019ll be able to have that part of your personal data locked down.\u000a\u000aThe FTC has a nice introduction to credit freezing here, and you can get a detailed game plan in my forthcoming book, Your Score.\u000a\u000aKnowing the ins and outs of the credit industry is not only Anthony Davenport\u2019s job; it\u2019s his passion. His firm helps manage and protect the credit and identities of some of the highest profile entertainers, professional athletes and ultra wealthy individuals in America. All that he has learned will be compiled in Your Score: An Insider\u2019s Secrets to Understanding, Controlling, and Protecting Your Credit Score, to be published in January 2018 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

aVAlison Wright makes one hell of a first impression. \u201cI\u2019m dying right now,\u201d the actress says mere moments after we meet, laughing and draping a blanket over her shoulders nearly as thick as her Sunderland accent. The situation is understandable, though. We sit down to talk in the back of a Brooklyn photography studio less than 24 hours after Wright made her Broadway debut in Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat, not to mention on the same Sunday the actress returns to TV in Feud: Bette and Joan, from reigning king of the anthology series, Ryan Murphy. It\u2019s an impressive, back-to-back series of accomplishments\u2014especially from someone introduced to American audiences just four years ago on The Americans\u2014that demands a celebration late into the night, early morning interview be damned.\u000a\u000aWell, early afternoon interview.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, though, if this is talking to Wright while she\u2019s dying, I\u2019d love to meet her living. The Lee Strasberg Institute graduate smiles easy and often; she answers questions with a stage performer\u2019s poise mingled with a charisma made for cameras. She\u2019s whip quick, too. At one point, to demonstrate her preparation for the 1961-set Feud, Wright seamlessly adopts an old-school American accent. \u201cWell, good morning, Ms. Crawford,\u201d she says, in a voice you might have heard echoing from Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre in an era when most of the handprints out front were still drying. Wright calls it \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood sound,\u201d and you recognize it immediately even without being able to describe how.\u000a\u000aIt is exactly \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood\u201d\u2014for better, but often for worse\u2014which Feud concerns itself with. The eight-episode anthology series chronicles the behind-the-scenes conflict of 1962 thriller Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which starred veritable screen legends and perennial rivals Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon). Come for the Hollywood Sign-sized drama\u2014bask in the shade, if you will\u2014but stay for a dive far deeper than the surface scratched by a cat-fight, a look at a film machine built by men, for men and the women it used, abused and spit out the moment the lens caught a wrinkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe knows the only time you pay attention to a woman is when she\u2019s in front of a camera,\u201d Wright, as assistant Pauline Jameson, tells Baby Jane director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in Feud\u2019s first episode. The \u201cshe,\u201d in this case, just happens to be one of Aldrich\u2019s many par-for-the-course affairs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intention was never just to make campy, kitschy fun,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how difficult it was for these women in the last 10, 15 years of their lives, at a time when their male counterparts were just beginning, and becoming more distinguished. Their life supply was cut off, really, for both of them, because they turned 50 years old.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Pauline, Wright has the unique task of portraying one of the few Feud roles to not exist in real life. Instead, Pauline operates as an amalgam of the show\u2019s more pressing themes. The assistants who should have been studio heads. The authoritative voices drowned out by the clacking of a secretary\u2019s typewriter. The woman who, quite literally, picked Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? from a pile of ideas and handed it off to a man.\u000a\u000a\u201cPauline is a composite of all the women who worked in the studio systems,\u201d Wright says. \u201cMy character represents a lot of these women who were very great and capable at their job, at a time everyone expected your endgame to be marriage and kids. Pauline wants to be a director. She wants a future in the business.\u201d\u000a\u000aWright\u2019s preparation went beyond adopting an accent; she adopted a mindset. \u201cWhat would it feel like if marriage and kids were not your endgame plan? Because it definitely isn\u2019t for Pauline. Back then, that made you unusual already, right there.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt always blows me away that, in this country, a woman couldn\u2019t have a credit card without her husband until 1974,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cI\u2019d just think about all these things where you would never believe that was actually the case until you actually find out that it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich is where Feud takes on an eerie undertone more akin to Murphy\u2019s other anthology series, where it becomes something of an actual American horror story, where you notice the trials and tribulations of that old Hollywood don\u2019t seem too different than those of that new Hollywood.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Wright says, eyes flashing. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. That it\u2019s not any different. Ryan is looking at, well, how far have things actually progressed in these 50, 60 years?\u201d\u000a\u000aBEGIN FLASHBACK:\u000a\u000aINT. 89TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS \u2013 EVENING\u000a\u000aActress BRIE LARSON refuses to applaud onstage as CASEY AFFLECK accepts his Best Actor win amid allegations of sexual assault. MEL GIBSON (choice dialogue: \u201cYou look like a fucking pig in heat,\u201d in reference to ex-wife Oksana Grigorieva) sits in the audience, smiling.\u000a\u000aEND FLASHBACK\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cSo I know exactly how it is to be a woman and move through the world. So this shit,\u201d referring to Feud, to Baby Jane, to Hollywood, to everything, \u201cit still applies.\u201d\u000a\u000aI ask Wright what first step needs to be taken toward a more inclusive Hollywood, and she tells me that step has already been taken\u2014by none other than Ryan Murphy himself. In early 2016, the uber-producer introduced the Half foundation to his Ryan Murphy Productions, an initiative that promised to fill at least 50 percent of his various shows\u2019 director slots with women. True to his word, Feud\u2019s eight-episode run sees two episodes helmed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton (American Horror Story, The Americans), another from Liza Johnson (Good Girls Revolt) and a penultimate chapter overseen by Oscar-winning actress turned director, Helen Hunt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are more women on Ryan\u2019s set than I have ever seen, anywhere,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cThere was a woman behind each camera. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Wright\u2014who came to the States 19 years ago and has lived and worked here ever since\u2014the shocking part of this conversation is the fact it\u2019s still a conversation at all. \u201cWomen are half of society, you know?\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the people who are making decisions, or making the content, are all just white guys in their 50s, that\u2019s the only perspective you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is, undoubtedly, a continuous uphill climb. The world did not change after it found out what happened to Baby Jane. This is the same Hollywood in which Sally Fields played Tom Hanks\u2019 mother in Forrest Gump, just six years after playing his love interest in 1988\u2019s Punchline. In which Feud\u2019s own Susan Sarandon (then 67) was old enough to play a 43-year-old Melissa McCarthy\u2019s grandmother in 2014\u2019s Tammy. In which the Hollywood-commanding, billion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe\u201415 films so far and seemingly continuing on into infinity\u2014has yet to use a single female director.\u000a\u000a\u2018Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If [women are] not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cStep one, we just need to get more women onto sets,\u201d Wright says. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is by going out of your way to demand that\u2019s what you want. The studios will bring Ryan, or whoever the director is, a selection of people to choose from. But if there\u2019s no women in that group . . .\u201d\u000a\u000aIf I absolutely had to guess, I\u2019d say the deep sigh that follows has nothing to do with last night\u2019s festivities. But after a moment, unsurprisingly, she is composed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut then, Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If we\u2019re not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u201d\u000a\u000aCase in point: The time, quite recently, a reality TV star caught on tape detailing his desire to grab a woman \u201cby the pussy\u201d was elected president of the United States. An occurrence that, as fate would have it, landed directly during the production of Feud.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course the election happened right in between shooting,\u201d Wright remembers. \u201cWe all thought it was going to be a certain way. We thought Hillary Clinton was going to be our president. We were going to have a girl in charge. And then it was like, \u2018Oh, no, no, we\u2019re still a very sexist, misogynist country. Let\u2019s not forget that we haven\u2019t traveled that far.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSomething key to note: Throughout our conversation, Wright refrains from mentioning the president by name; she says, simply, \u201ca certain man.\u201d The time before January 20 is \u201cpre-him.\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of this, she says, is to avoid \u201cgiving him his time.\u201d But mostly, it\u2019s a way to separate her work, her art, from burdening politics. Especially Nottage\u2019s Sweat, a play that, on the surface, is a clear-cut mirror of the modern political scene. Set in the industrial town of Reading, Pennsylvania, Sweat focuses on the post-war decline of the working class, of prosperity giving way to uncertainty. Wright plays Jessie, a woman hit hard by sudden unemployment, and harder by the alcohol she uses to forget it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t always get to be a part of something that\u2019s actually important in terms of society and where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d says Wright, the only new cast member added after the play\u2019s Off-Broadway transfer. \u201cBut this is timely, and it\u2019s actually an important piece of art in terms of reflecting back the state of our society at the moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sweat, which Nottage wrote after extensive interviews between 2001 and 2008 with old factory town workers, \u201cis not about the man who is president.\u201d Wright is adamant. \u201cIt\u2019s about the state of the American working class.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s interesting, though, the projects and roles Wright continues to find herself in\u2014Feud, Sweat, The Americans, this interview itself\u2014that require a deeper look than a first glance. That are far, far more than a first impression. It\u2019s the reason Wright\u2019s Martha on The Americans\u2014who began as near-comic relief and ended her run as the epitome of quiet strength\u2014reminds me of Feud\u2019s Pauline Jameson, despite the years and genres between them.\u000a\u000aWright nods at the comparison. \u201cWell, neither of them are the first two women to be underestimated.\u201d And, despite it all, she grins. \u201cOr the last.\u201d

aVNear Mint, is our weekly comics column where we discuss all the KAPOW! that\u2019s fit to print. This week: Johnnie travels to the home of Snoop Dogg for a social justice-themed Long Beach Comic Con.\u000a\u000aThere are two ends of the spectrum when it comes to comic book conventions. There are the shiny, bright cons full of trailer premieres and movie stars,  la San Diego Comic Con. And then there are the ones where you feel like you\u2019re in a huge basement. I prefer the latter, the kind of low-key affairs where you can be the only person at the \u201cHistory of Ultraman Dubbing\u201d panel. Long Beach Comic Con, which took place this past Saturday and Sunday at the Long Beach Convention Center, is somewhere happily in the middle. The convention floor was dimly lit but quite large. Attendees played games of Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart on consoles attached to faint projectors while others rifled through rows and rows of back issue bins. Artist Dave Gibbons (Watchmen) and Pia Guerra (Y: The Last Man) were amongst the VIPs in attendance. At his booth in the artist\u2019s alley, Young Justice co-creator Todd Nauck knocked out commissioned sketches while his extremely affable wife Dawn made small talk with convention goers. The Democratic Socialists of America were in attendance (more on that later), and a long line snaked around parts of the room as people waited to pose with a grumpy old man named William Shatner.\u000a\u000aBut the real stars of Long Beach Comic Con were the cosplayers. Cosplayer Steve Gonzales hit the convention floor as the entire Justice League, in a robotic ensemble that included Wonder Woman\u2019s lasso, Aquaman\u2019s trident, and a small screen in the middle of his chest that flashed the names and images of the league\u2019s core members. Anthony Bernal\u2019s hyper-realistic Planet of the Apes costume took a year and a half to put together and included contributions from Ape Mania\u2014a simian atelier that specializes in Planet of the Apes cosplay. During the \u201cPlus Size Cosplay: Love the Skin You\u2019re In!\u201d panel, a mostly female crew of curvaceous superheroes preached body positivity and gave some good advice for wannabe cosplayers: research your corset, break it in hourly each day, and make sure your corset is steel boned. Also, if you\u2019re packing down below, wear a dance belt\u2014it\u2019s sort of like a jock strap that covers up your member.\u000a\u000aBritish comics scribe Sebastian Jones could be seen exuberantly hawking his Stranger Comics imprint on the convention floor. His work includes Niobe: She is Life, co-written by Jones and Hunger Games actor Amandla Stenberg. Niobe is a coming of age story threaded with murder and mystery whose protagonist is a Black human-elf hybrid strongly resembling Stenberg. In the sequel, Niobe: She is Death, Niobe becomes a bounty hunter taking down sex traffickers and slave traders. \u201cNiobe was the first nationally distributed comic book with a black female author, artist, and hero in the history of comics,\u201d says Jones, though more recently Stenberg has identified as non-binary. \u201cBefore us, DC had hired two black female writers in their history and Marvel had hired zero\u201d Jones explained. \u201cWhen we came out, Marvel and DC started hiring Black women.\u201d\u000a\u000aOvert discussions around race and politics have become slightly more explicit in comics these days, as they have in larger American culture. Exhibitor Jose Pulido sold art featuring familiar characters like Pikachu and Harley Quinn depicted as Mexican Day of the Dead Sugar Skulls. Artist Caroline Foley\u2019s booth included Care Bears with a raised fists and LGBT feminist symbols or Islamic stars and crescents emblazoned on their bellies. While the superheroes we see on screen and in the pages are largely still white, the heroic cosplayers in attendance were far more diverse: an older Asian couple could be seen cheerfully meandering around the front entrance dressed as Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. The appearance of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), whose Long Beach chapter could be seen demonstrating outside the Con, added to the occasionally political tone of the event. With cheers of \u201cImmigrants are welcome here,\u201d the DSA\u2019s goal at the con was to encourage Long Beach to adopt sanctuary city status. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s a big fan of superheroes, and comic book justice is a big part of his online persona, but locally he\u2019s not doing anything to protect undocumented people\u201d said DSA co-chair Andrew Guy. \u201cWe want no local city resources going towards deportation, and an embargo on sharing private information, immigration status or religious status, with deportation officials.\u201d\u000a\u000aLike any good convention, there were some bizarre curiosities to take in. Mike Matola\u2019s booth featured a series of drawings in which specific film scripts were written out by hand in minuscule text that generated a larger image of that film\u2019s starring characters. The entire script for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles formed the shape of turtles Don, Leo, Mike, and Raph, for example. Aaron Schwartz of Central Curios sold handcrafted wizard\u2019s wands made by a combination of lathe work, hand carving, and wood burning. Each wand is unique and never remade. There were bejeweled wands, and one was carved to resemble a walrus. Aaron\u2019s personal wand is made of holly and is ten and three-quarter inches long, and Aaron says Harry Potter\u2019s wand is also made of holly but the off-white wood often warps on camera. The wand in the films is a darker color. At a panel on Saturday morning, My Little Pony comics artist Tony Fleecs regaled the crowd with a story he pitched involving the ponies tripping out after swimming in a pond infected by slime from a \u201cparty frog.\u201d Hasbro, of course, did not approve of the horses doing hallucinogens. The story did not make it to print.\u000a\u000aSaturday ended with a series of group photos featuring Marvel and DC cosplayers lined up on the steps in the front of the convention center. While these photo ops are common at cons, it was truly incredible to see all these colorful people united, if only for a moment, in fandom. It\u2019s times like this where billion dollar licensed characters can live and breathe- stripped of their commercial value by the purity of cosplayers who celebrate these heroes just for fun and not for profit. The spirit of fun was alive and well throughout Long Beach Comic Con and here\u2019s hoping it can stay alive for many years to come.

aVIf you are standing right now, I suggest you sit down, because we\u2019re going to begin with some truly shocking news: Aubrey Plaza is not a 50-year-old man.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, this should be clear to anyone who has followed Plaza on her rise to stardom over the years\u2014the seven seasons portraying the human embodiment of an eye-roll, April Ludgate, on NBC\u2019s Parks & Recreation, her quieter standout roles in indies like Safety Not Guaranteed and Ned Rifle, or more recent big-screen endeavors like Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Certainly, it\u2019s clear to me, sitting across from the actress at a Los Feliz noodle bar, a month before she\u2019s set to co-star in Legion, FX\u2019s Marvel-universe mind-bender from Fargo creator Noah Hawley.\u000a\u000aBut is it clear to Hawley? Harder to say. In the original pilot script for Legion, Hawley wrote the character of Lenny Busker as a male, middle-aged former drug-addict, the resident, older sage of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, providing both optimism and advice to our mutant main character David Haller (Dan Stevens). The question becomes, What made the writer-director, after a single meeting with Plaza, decide the 32-year-old actress would be a perfect fit for the part?\u000a\u000a\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she says and laughs, before changing tact. \u201cI mean, no, I get it. I think that maybe that\u2019s my real, underneath persona, and at heart, I\u2019m like a 50-year-old drug addict living in a mental hospital. And Noah saw that\u2019s who I am, really, underneath it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a typical answer from Plaza. You often don\u2019t realize she\u2019s joking until halfway through a sentence, and by then it turns into a game of catch-up with an Upright Citizens Brigade veteran. But it\u2019s not a cold-shoulder thing, either, not a heightened social awkwardness. Despite what every interview with the actress written between 2009 and 2015 would have you believe, she\u2019s not actually April Ludgate. The first order of business she suggests after sitting down is that we take a C-Shot together. Despite having no idea what a C-Shot is, I agree. \u201cGreat, let\u2019s just go crazy,\u201d she replies, stone-faced.\u000a\u000a\u201cCrazy,\u201d as it turns out, is an apropos way to begin any conversation over Legion. Any viewer expecting the formulaic blueprint of your typical Marvel blockbuster\u2014the family tragedy, the unwilling hero, the British thespian hamming it up as the villain, etcetera, etcetera\u2014is likely to come away disappointed or, at least, plenty confused.\u000a\u000aThe character of David Haller has been around in paper-and-ink form since 1985 when writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz brought him to life in New Mutants #25. The son of chrome-domed psychic Charles Xavier (a spoiler for the comics but not, as far as I know, the show), Haller is the human equivalent of an overbooked hotel; his mutant ability is essentially a heightened form of dissociative identity disorder, formerly known by its cruder term \u201csplit personality,\u201d with each unique persona adding to a deafening cacophony of separate abilities.\u000a\u000aWith Legion, Hawley has taken this idea\u2014what if you were several \u201cyous\u201d somehow simultaneously\u2014and translated it to the small screen in a way that is not only immersive and exciting but, at times, overwhelmingly confusing. Characters jump timelines and swap bodies. Reality often shifts, without warning, or gives way completely to another layer underneath, and on at least one occasion, that layer is a synchronized dance number. To wit, Legion is weird\u2014and unlike anything Marvel has done before.\u000a\u000aAnd through it all\u2014the confusion, complexity and chaos\u2014the one constant remains Plaza\u2019s blood-shot Lenny Busker. \u201cMy goal was for Lenny to be the happy place for David, at all times,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaving that to focus on, with all that other bad stuff lingering in the background for me, was a good combination. It helped me play the character as someone fighting against the bad stuff and allowed it to be more than just, \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m so crazy. I\u2019m like, totally tweaking out.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat border, between comic-book storytelling and the reality of mental illness, is where Legion walks its finest line. After all, the series\u2019 main thesis, spouted from inside a psychiatric hospital, is that occasionally the illness is your strength, and more dangerously, the voices in your head might be telling some form of truth. In a scene from the pilot, David, Lenny and newcomer Syd (Rachel Keller) sit in support group, while a doctor grills them on their respective problems. \u201cWhat if your problems are in your head?\u201d Syd asks. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not even problems?\u201d\u000a\u000aLenny, who until then is too busy grooving to oversized headphones to participate, leans forward. \u201cI like you,\u201d she says, eyes wide. \u201cYou got what the kids these days call \u2018moxie.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI liked the idea, and I think Noah really likes the idea, of having Lenny be this optimist despite the challenges she\u2019s facing,\u201d Plaza tells me. \u201cYou have this character in a mental hospital. She\u2019s a drug addict. She pretty much has everything possible going wrong for her. But she\u2019s the one making jokes, to cheer David up, to be the bright light in it all. That was interesting to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith that, our C-Shots arrived, a mixture of cayenne pepper and lemon that, very much like Legion, is simultaneously refreshing and hard to swallow. We drink. I cough. She does not.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s entirely plausible that the reason Hawley saw Lenny Busker as fluid is Plaza herself, as a character actress, is nearly impossible to typecast down. Every move post-Parks, even across from Robert De Niro in the critically maligned yet financially successful Dirty Grandpa, has looked like a move away from an April Ludgate-shaped trap, marked with that dreaded qualifier, \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This, Plaza tells me, is deliberate. \u201cThere was definitely a time where people couldn\u2019t see beyond April Ludgate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in playing all different types of parts, and getting those parts are hard when people put you in a box.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwo Plaza-starring features debuted at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, as different as they were successful. The first, Ingrid Goes West, is part social media satire, part twisted road-trip film. Plaza, who also served as producer, plays Ingrid, an Instagram-obsessive who moves across the country to befriend social-celebrity Ingrid Sloane (played by Marvel peer Elizabeth Olsen, of Avengers fame). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a social media commentary, but it\u2019s not really about that,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about human relationships, and human connections, and how some people have a really hard time making them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA phenomenon, to prove there is no limit to art imitating life, that Plaza knows all too well. A few days prior to our conversation, the actress deleted her Twitter account (@EvilHag, of course), an act nearly blasphemous in the age of instant information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a long time coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like it made sense to do it right before the new year started, some kind of lame way of saying, \u2018Fuck it, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019 I realized that it was adding nothing positive to my life. It was unhealthy. It just bummed me out, honestly.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza\u2019s second Sundance offering is, well, a little harder to explain, 140 characters or not, even for the actress herself. The Little Hours, Plaza\u2019s third collaboration with writer-director Jeff Baena, has so many conflicting personalities it could star in Legion. At once a faithful adaptation of 14th-Century novella collection The Decameron and a raunchy comedy, the film sees Plaza playing a nun but not really, she warns, without further explanation. But yes, a nun (kind of), forced to live in a convent in the age of the Bubonic Plague. \u201cIt\u2019s almost academic. I think colleges would show it to explain that time period,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIf, you know, it wasn\u2019t so fucked up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with starring beside the likes of John C. Reilly, Alison Brie and Dave Franco, Plaza was put on prayer duty; that is to say, Baena asked the Catholic born-and-raised actress to ensure The Little Hours\u2019 dialogue, in between the countless \u201cfucks,\u201d was as Biblically accurate as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was kind of funny because I was working on Legion, which is a very different thing, a very dark thing,\u201d Plaza remembers, \u201cand I kept switching from that to literally reading the Bible at night. I, like, stole the Bible from my hotel room.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd as she reads, she remembers: memories, she tells me, of a childhood in a Catholic home, of leading mass as cantor, of Bible study and even of her very first paying job working the front desk of a convent attached to her all-girls high school. \u201cI just sat there and answered phone calls, mainly from the shoe cobbler who would have the nuns\u2019 shoes nice and cobbled.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing really crazy happened. I wish I had a scandalous nun story for you,\u201d she continues. I point out the cosmic irony of, decades later, playing a nun herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Plaza smiles. A few weeks later, reviews pour out of Sundance for The Little Hours, focusing primarily on sacramental wine chugging, chastity-vow breaking and a particular scene in which Plaza pelts a man with radishes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make them all so proud.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza began her 2017 with a dance. As the clock struck midnight on December 31, the actress, her Twitter deleted, Legion set to debut in two months, had a single resolution. \u201cMy goal was to start a legit dance party,\u201d she tells me.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had a massive New Year\u2019s Eve party at my house, about 200 people,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe packed it in. There was one point, right before midnight, there were so many people there you couldn\u2019t move. It was a fire hazard. And I wanted to get everyone to a dance floor.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza keeps herself busy with work\u2014\u201cI only act,\u201d she tells me, a statement that remains true well into 2017\u2014and doesn\u2019t really do New Year\u2019s Resolutions, or, at least, can think of none off the top of her head. Which makes this single objective, in the middle of a packed house, a unique one.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were playing all of the songs you want to hear\u2014Bowie, Prince, George Michael\u2014we were trying to do a whole, \u2018Can you fucking believe what happened in 2016?\u2019 playlist. But then I just was like, We gotta get some Chance the Rapper and start getting down and dirty with it. I felt there was kind of an energy to that party where everyone was just like, \u2018Ugh, I want to dance off 2016, get it out and start over.\u2019 That\u2019s all I wanted, and it happened, right after midnight.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was,\u201d she continues, \u201cwhat the kids these days call \u2018a rager.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aListening back over the interview audio later, things clicked into place right there, mostly, I imagine, because Plaza borrowed a phrase from her own character, Lenny Busker, the aforementioned \u201cwhat the kids these days call\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aNot to presume I understand Noah Hawley\u2014there are still parts of Legion I couldn\u2019t describe, even on a good day\u2014but on one particular point, I could attempt a guess. What did he see in Plaza, in one meeting, that made her the perfect fit for Lenny Busker? Let her tell you a story over one interview, over one meeting, and the matter of gender and age fall away; instead, you see there is no difference, really, between the woman who looked at a year of darkness, death and uncertainty and thought first of a dance-floor, and Lenny Busker, the eternal optimist in oversized headphones, lighting the way through the mental asylum.

aVIn a recent interview with Time Out London, the actor Daniel Radcliffe mentions that he was once rejected by a Frieze Art Fair dealer because he wasn\u2019t exactly what the gallery was hoping for in a buyer.\u000a\u000aThe relevant quote, courtesy of The Art Newspaper:\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to Frieze Art Fair and saw a painting by Jim Hodges. The guy said, \u2018No, we\u2019re waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that.\u2019 I was like, thanks, thanks a lot,\u201d says the miffed movie star in Time Out.\u000a\u000aBastards! But wait! Is that the whole story? Because he spun a similar yarn to The Guardian in 2009 that ended much more happily:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dealer said they wanted to sell it to a more prestigious collector, and Jim got word of this. Turns out he\u2019s a massive Harry Potter fan and insisted they sell it to me. Ever since then I\u2019ve been really good friends with Jim and his best mate Tim, a photographer. And they are two gay guys, artists, in New York, and they introduced me to these amazing, crazy, mad, weird, extraordinary people. I was immediately embraced by the New York tranny community!\u201d The Hodges work, Mona D, Mary And Me, is \u201cbasically a drawing of blue ink on white paper. And it\u2019s the words, \u2018Oh for crying out loud\u2019 which is something his mum always used to say, as I think probably all our mothers did. And in the midst of it, it\u2019s weirdly calligraphic.\u201d What was its appeal? \u201cI suppose \u2013 without meaning to sound like it\u2019s a link to Harry Potter \u2013 it\u2019s about finding something magical and fantastical in a mundane phrase. That\u2019s what\u2019s lovely about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor also apparently owns a Damien Hirst butterfly painting, which \u201c[he] love[s].\u201d

aVC-3PO tends to be most people\u2019s first representation of a super smart robot. Star Wars\u2019 beloved protocol droid acts very much as an individual, with its own distinct personality. The films never address the question, but C-3PO\u2019s intellgence appears to reside entirely on the droid\u2019s CPU.\u000a\u000aBut when artificially intelligent machines become prevalent here in the real world, they won\u2019t work like that at all. Self-driving cars won\u2019t really drive themselves. They will be driven largely by brains in the cloud.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. House of Representative\u2019s unanimously passed a bill this week offered by Ohio\u2019s Rep. Bob Latta, greenlighting the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Key leaders in the Senate have expressed an appetite for such legislation, but its language on riders\u2019 privacy looks inadequate some advocates.\u000a\u000aAll the cars\u2019 many sensors will beam information gathered directly to online navigation systems. That\u2019s piles of data about road conditions, weather and other cars on the road. Those logs can be directly associated with the people riding in the car. It\u2019s the simplest pieces of data about each trip that are probably the most revealing: where it started, where it ended and who was in the car.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a few instances when simple route information could reveal too much:\u000a\u000aLots of trips taking place between two competing companies could suggest a merger deal underway,\u000a\u000aIf one firm has lots of specialized accountants and lawyers visiting, that could indicate there\u2019s trouble on its books or\u000a\u000aIf one employee has taken multiple trips to another company\u2019s office, that could indicate that they are in talks to switch jobs.\u000a\u000aSound paranoid? It shouldn\u2019t, because we\u2019ve seen it before.\u000a\u000aSecurity researchers were able to easily identify individual taxi cabs in a pool of data about trips and fares collected by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission. Then, by using images captured by photographers and social media, they could identify specific trips taken by celebrities (and how much they tipped).\u000a\u000aSelf-driving cars have a great deal of promise for mitigating traffic deaths, lowering the cost of transportation and reducing traffic, but they risk exposing people\u2019s secrets, too.\u000a\u000aConsidering having an affair? Better buy a bicycle.\u000a\u000aThe current version of the legislation requires all autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles to have a plan for the data that it collects about the people in its cars. The main protection it offers consumers is this: the company has to give them some idea of what it\u2019s doing with the data it gathers about them (including sharing it with other companies). It also requires the Federal Trade Commission to look into the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrivacy plans are not a substitute for privacy protections,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote the Observer in an email. EPIC issued a statement on the bill Thursday, noting in particular that the law preempts state law, making it impossible for forward-thinking states to hold vehicle makers to a higher standard (as California has consistently done with automobile emissions rules).\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Senate will need to look at these issues more closely. Right now, autonomous vehicles are \u2018unsafe at any speed,\u2019\u201d Rotenberg wrote (link added).\u000a\u000aJohn Verdi of the Future of Privacy Forum saw the legislation as a net positive. He wrote the Observer in an email, \u201cConnected cars are increasingly sitting in American driveways and operating on roadways. The privacy requirements are important first steps in ensuring that drivers\u2019 privacy is protected while they enjoy the massive potential safety and environmental benefits of connected vehicles.\u201d\u000a\u000aVerdi added that leading automakers have signed onto voluntary principles that require them to seek affirmative consent for sharing more sensitive data. Which is good, but non-obligatory commitments could erode quickly as robot-driven rubber actually hits internet-connected roads.\u000a\u000aPrivacy International helped us compare the SELF-DRIVE Act\u2019s standards to the basic privacy guidelines in Europe, under its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes enforceable next year.\u000a\u000aIn Europe, privacy policies have to include a privacy impact assessment, according to Ailidh Callander, a legal officer with the organization, who emailed the Observer via a spokesperson. Such an assessment would require \u201can assessment of the necessity and the proportionality of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of the individual\u2019s whose data is being processed,\u201d she wrote.\u000a\u000aShe noted several particular deficiencies in the American legislation. For example, it never addresses deletion of data.\u000a\u000aPrivacy advocates tend to prefer for data to have a shelf life. But nothing in this legislation suggests that a record of your trip to the mini-mart ever needs to be deleted. And if it shares that data with a third party, who knows who else that company may share it with? In the end, it could be copied so many times that your embarrassing midnight ice cream run might never be lost to history.\u000a\u000aCallander added that consumers should have the ability to see the particulars of data carmakers collect, as well as the right to review, challenge and erase that data. Further, consumers should not simply be informed that data is shared, but how much of it, with which organizations and why.\u000a\u000aLastly, Privacy International suggested that consumers should also have a way to contact someone at the company that collects data about their rides.\u000a\u000aRep. Latta\u2019s office referred the Observer\u2019s questions about privacy to staff at the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. Greg Walden, of Oregon. The chairman\u2019s office was not immediately available for comment. The legislation will need to be considered by the U.S. Senate before it can be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump\u2019s signature.\u000a\u000aC-3PO can choose to keep to keep your secrets (even if Princess Leia only trusted R2-D2), but real world robots have no choice but to share. Once shared, secrets get stored.\u000a\u000aYesterday, we learned that 143 million Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information (the kind that enables identity theft) had been stolen from the credit reporting agency, Equifax. This follows breaches from Yahoo, Patreon and Ashley Madison, among many others. Even Facebook-owned Instagram let slip the contact information of its most famous users.\u000a\u000aThe private sector has proven a poor steward of very sensitive personal information, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. Protecting and deleting customer data falls on the expense side of the ledger, but selling, sharing and using data, that\u2019s all potential revenue.

aV\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s drizzling rain outside when I meet Ashley Eckstein, the actress who voices the fan favorite animated Star Wars character Ahsoka Tano and founder of the rapidly growing geek girl fashion line Her Universe. But inside Alice\u2019s Tea Cup\u2014her suggestion for tea, scones and restorative afternoon treats\u2014we\u2019ve found a cozy sanctum. Up a colorful rickety staircase, and beneath a glowing chandelier, I\u2019m greeted by Eckstein, who is donning one of Her Universe\u2019s newest designs: a fitted jean jacket embroidered with the Star Wars credo across the back, \u201cMay the Force Be With You.\u201d While Eckstein is only in New York briefly before heading West to check out the new Her Universe offices in Los Angeles now that the company has been acquired by retail giant Hot Topic, and then flying back East to her home in Florida, she happens to be a devoted Alice in Wonderland fan, and so there\u2019s always time for a tea party.\u000a\u000aHaving trouble finding a women\u2019s Star Trek t-shirt, or perhaps a Doctor Who hoodie that is not pink? Her Universe has you covered. The company began as a small t-shirt business in 2010 and has since evolved into an online fashion destination for affordable, diverse and refreshingly chic fan gear for women. Eckstein started Her Universe shortly after she began her voice work as Ahsoka Tano, when a personal search for Star Wars clothing to celebrate her new role left her with unsettlingly few options.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt really started honestly from a selfish place: What would I want? What would I wear?\u201d she tells me, as our tea arrives at the table. Early on, she set out to be different, and established a few rules that have become the core of what makes Her Universe appeal to fangirls. \u201cI love the color pink, but in the beginning [I decided] there would be nothing in our line with the color pink. Female fans, they\u2019d kind of been treated like an afterthought. They would make 20 shirts for guys and one shirt for girls, and it would be in pink and it would say \u2018I Heart Star Wars.\u2019 We\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it, which was at the time unheard of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it.\u201d \u2014 Her Universe founder Ashley Eckstein\u000a\u000aAnd so, Eckstein embarked on an ambitious venture: to create an apparel market for female fans where there was none. She found a manufacturer to partner with, and sought out her first license with Star Wars from Lucasfilm. \u201cI think we started out with 9 t-shirts, and that was it,\u201d she says. As the company grew, it acquired licenses from the Syfy channel, Disney, Marvel, BBC and Studio Ghibli, and expanded its offerings to include sweaters, jackets, dresses, leggings and an accessories line. Browse the Her Universe website and you\u2019ll just as soon find retro-style shirts with Thor, Spider-Man and Loki as you will a black skirt decorated with rainbow lightsaber design and a red, yellow and blue Captain Marvel Jacket. The company\u2019s line is stocked with graphic tees, dresses inspired by characters like Boba Fett and Agent Carter, as well as plus size options and clothes for kids.\u000a\u000aTaking the leap from t-shirts to fashion, meant finding a bigger partner. In 2016, Her Universe became a subsidiary of Hot Topic, though Eckstein still retains full control of the company. The move, she says, has just allowed the company to do more. Today, Her Universe hosts an annual fashion show at San Diego Comic Con, has retail partnerships with brands such as Kohl\u2019s to create a line of activewear, and a publishing imprint. In just a few short years, Eckstein has helped make geek girl gear into an industry.\u000a\u000aFandom has been a part of Eckstein\u2019s life for as long as she can remember, she tells me. Growing up, her father worked for Disney, and her love of Star Wars has always been a constant. She moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and worked in film and television before landing what she calls her \u201cdream come true\u201d role voicing Ahsoka, the first female Jedi to lead a series in the Star Wars franchise, and who has helped pave the way for a new generation of strong female characters like Rey and Jynn Erso. But while women today are more visible in the sci-fi and fantasy world than ever (roughly half of Comic Con attendees are women, and a 2013 survey by Wired found that similar numbers applied to fans of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.) However, in 2008 when Eckstein began her work with the franchise, she found that female fans faced more discrimination and bullying than acceptance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought, this is no way to live your life. Being a sci-fi fan is literally a part of your DNA, it\u2019s a part of who you are. Like I said, to me, I love tea parties, I love Alice in Wonderland, I love cupcakes and I love Star Wars. It\u2019s just a descriptor of who I literally say I am\u2014it\u2019s not a trend.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo while Her Universe is primarily known for its apparel line, it\u2019s also become a tight knit community for fangirls, both online and at comic con conventions and fan events. Eckstein travels constantly, bouncing between her work as Ahsoka and being the public face of her company. Critical to her success has been staying active on social media. Today, Her Universe\u2019s Twitter account has 54,000+ followers, on Instagram 67,000 and the brand reaches across Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr and Snapchat.\u000a\u000a\u201cA big part of our strategy was to go grassroots\u2026to interact with the fans directly,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the girls think they\u2019re talking to me it\u2019s because they are, and it has been from Day 1. It\u2019s just me asking the fans, What do you want?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what they want, it seems, are options. \u201cWe need [designs] for different aspects of our lifestyle. When you go to work you\u2019re not just going to wear a big logo T. Maybe you\u2019re going to wear a blazer where it\u2019s just a black blazer on the outside, but the lining is lined with Delta shields.\u201d Her Universe now offers exactly that: Behold the open-front Trek Blazer, which is part of the new collection for ThinkGeek.\u000a\u000aWhile Her Universe designs offer wide appeal to the most casual and devoted fans (who doesn\u2019t love R2D2?), creating designs that will appeal to both isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cI did discover there\u2019s a difference between super inside designs that may speak to the hardcore fans, and then you have to offer a design that even casual fans will like to. If you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000aHer Universe may have opened the market for geek girl fashion, but it\u2019s no longer the only player in the game. Major companies such as M.A.C. cosmetics and Columbia sportswear have created Star Wars-inspired collections, and Rodarte hit the run way with a line of couture gowns. But Eckstein isn\u2019t intimidated by the competition\u2014far from it, she embraces it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for it because everyone always wants to strive for what they see on the runway, but not everyone can afford that $4,000 dress. So, then they come to companies like ours. We\u2019re known for being affordable fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more mainstream it becomes in fashion, it makes it more acceptable for girls to walk in to work and wear a Star Wars blazer, and for it to be acceptable. And that\u2019s what I want. [For] fans to celebrate their fandom.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow that geek girl has gone mainstream, what\u2019s next? Eckstein has some predictions: \u201cThe Superhero lifestyle and look is on trend. But also\u2014last year we saw it at the Met Gala and we saw it at the Her Universe fashion show\u2014is wearable technology.\u201d The winner of the 2016 Her Universe fashion show used thermochromatic pigment and heating tape to make the Marauder\u2019s Map from Harry Potter appear and disappear on a dress in the time it took to walk the length of the runway.\u000a\u000a\u201cYears ago that would have appeared very geeky in the fashion world\u2026now it\u2019s becoming couture,\u201d she quips. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m excited about that, I think that trend is just starting. We\u2019re seeing it on the runways, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that comes into everyday fashion.\u201d\u000a\u000aEckstein admits that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead before the pop culture world becomes an equal space for female fans and entrepreneurs. But in fashion, the geek girl revolution is well on its way.

aV\u201cTanning is about products that are easy at home, no hassle\u2014not scary tanning, but someone using it and feeling confident with what they\u2019re doing,\u201d James Read told us, spray gun in hand. The Observer spoke to the London-based tanning expert, who became famous for his tantouring technique, where he emphasizes collar bones and dcolletage, creating a natural glow that won\u2019t turn orange under camera lights.\u000a\u000aRead has been working in tanning for 15 years. Since his start, he\u2019s become the go-to guy to the stars, including Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Jessie J, Naomi Campbell and Mariah Carey.\u000a\u000aRead is one reason the Lindsay Lohan\u2019s orange look fell out of favor in the early aughts. \u201cI helped change people\u2019s perception of tanning,\u201d he told us from his room at the Gramercy Hotel, which had more than enough room for a tanning tent. \u201cA lot of celebrities I tanned from the beginning, like Gaga and Rosie Huntington-Whitely, started to strip back from orange looking tans at award ceremonies to natural looking glows. It was all about working with your whole look, not overpowering it.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, some tan fans still go for the darkest hue. \u201cThe younger market is jumping back on the dark tans again,\u201d Read revealed. \u201cWhereas people in their 30s are more into the natural glow. Eighteen to 25 are into full on dark tans in UK and Australia.\u201d He\u2019s even launching a super dark tanning product in Australia to embrace the aesthetic.\u000a\u000aHe launched his brand seven years ago, as a way to combine tanning and skincare. His products include everything from an overnight mask to a tantour kit. \u201cI was giving all the products to Rosie [Huntington-Whitely] and Ellie Goulding, and they were testing it. Rosie was obsessed with the sleep mask and giving it to her friends. Cara Delevingne bought it on a British Airways flight, which was quite cool.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor those who would rather tan at home than strip down to their skivvies in front of a stranger, it\u2019s easy to get the same glow. Read\u2019s tips are to moisturize, never apply too much, wait three to four days to re-apply and to moisturize daily. \u201cAs the old tan breaks, it takes the new tan with it, and that\u2019s how the tans look patchy. Then you look orange, you get the dodgy angles, or the hands and the wrists,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFor special events, Read suggests photographing yourself to make sure it\u2019s not too dark. \u201cDo a tan selfie and you\u2019ll be able to see what the tan looks like. You see differently through a camera lens, it shows how people will actually be seeing you.\u201d And if you want the same tan as your favorite celebrity, Read suggests his tantouring technique. \u201cTantouring is about using the tan to contour certain areas of the body, so you look fit. Tan the day before, wash the tan off, then stand in front of the mirror and spray the tops of the legs, the front of the shoulders, the dcolletage, down the sides. Leave it on for an hour then wash it off and it will highlight the areas.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut women aren\u2019t the only ones aiming for a golden glow. \u201cMen now have jumped on the whole tanning thing,\u201d Read told us. \u201cRyan Reynolds uses the bronzing mist and the sleep mask because he\u2019s filming Deadpool 2 and requested all the stuff to be sent so he can tan himself while filming.\u201d The popularity has led to Read creating a new product specifically for men to use after they shave.\u000a\u000aIf you can\u2019t make it to visit Read personally, at his central London spray tanning suite, there\u2019s still the opportunity to tantour in the comfort of your own home. His products have been sold since 2014 on Net-a-Porter, and they\u2019re now at Blue Mercury and Sephora.

aVSecret service bosses are a notoriously tight-lipped bunch, particularly in Eastern Europe, where the Soviet legacy of complete state secrecy lingers. In the former Soviet Union, where the KGB ruled for most of the last century, spy chiefs give few interviews, and when they do they say very little of interest. Such is the nature of the espionage business there.\u000a\u000aIt was therefore something of a shock this weekend when Vasyl Hrytsak, Ukraine\u2019s secret service chief, gave an interview jam-packed with bombshells about the nasty SpyWar between Kyiv and Moscow. That clandestine struggle is an appendage to the low-boil conflict being waged in Eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and \u201crebels\u201d who are in fact the Russian military.\u000a\u000aCasualties are generally modest\u2014a couple soldiers here, another handful there\u2014yet they are constant. Shelling, sniping, and patrolling take a steady toll of Ukrainian defenders who are holding the line in the country\u2019s east, keeping the Russian invader at bay, and the conflict shows no signs of abating anytime soon. Roughly one-third of the 10,100 dead in the Russo-Ukrainian War have fallen since the so-called Minsk II cease-fire was hashed out in February 2015.\u000a\u000aThe espionage portion of this conflict is seldom mentioned in the media, so Hrytsak\u2019s comments were highly unusual. It should be noted that Hrytsak isn\u2019t a political hack; he is a career intelligence officer who has worked for the Security Service of Ukraine or SBU since the early 1990s and has been its head since mid-2015.\u000a\u000aIn a TV interview, Hrytsak minced no words in calling out his Russian counterpart, Aleksandr Bortnikov, head of the Federal Security Service, the powerful FSB. Having previously explained three weeks ago that the SBU knew that the Kremlin had dispatched spy-saboteurs to undertake terrorist attacks inside Ukraine, Hrytsak now made a direct appeal to Bortnikov:\u000a\u000aI appeal to you as an officer. There are rules even in war that should not be broken by secret service agents. You have transgressed all these rules.\u000a\u000aStating how destabilizing FSB terror on Ukraine would be, Hrytsak went on:\u000a\u000aDo you realize what geopolitical consequences these actions may have? Do you realize that you will be forced to answer for your actions? It is in your power to stop it. So, stop it now.\u000a\u000aThen Hrytsak called out Bortnikov and the Kremlin for a series of terrorist attacks in Ukraine that were perpetrated by the FSB:\u000a\u000aYou and I both know Russian secret service agents were involved in terrorist acts committed in Odesa, Kharkiv, Kherson and other cities. Dozens of people died as a result. But this time you have broken all the rules and are prepared to destabilize the situation in Russia in order to justify invading Ukraine in a massive military campaign.\u000a\u000aThe attacks Hrytsak referenced\u2014fires and clashes in Odesa in May 2014 that killed 48, a bombing in Kharkiv in February 2015 that killed four, and a car bombing in Kherson in April 2016 that killed one\u2014are believed by the SBU to be Russian handiwork. Kyiv\u2019s view is shared by Western security services. A senior American intelligence official with extensive experience in Eastern Europe told me there was \u201cabsolutely no doubt\u201d that the FSB stood behind those terrorist attacks inside Ukraine.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, Moscow sending terrorists to Ukraine to foment a broader crisis\u2014and perhaps a fully renewed war\u2014therefore cannot be ruled out as a malevolent fantasy. Dispatching assassins abroad to create mayhem and settle scores with Vladimir Putin\u2019s enemies\u2014even in Washington, D.C.\u2014is something this Kremlin does with disturbing frequency.\u000a\u000aHowever, Hrytsak wasn\u2019t content to stop there. He accused Bortnikov of crossing the \u201cred line\u201d by plotting something truly nefarious to justify renewed aggression against Ukraine. That red line, the SBU chief explained, was even more sinister:\u000a\u000aYou were ready to blow up your own Russian citizens in order to destabilize the situation in Russia and give grounds for invading Ukraine, to launch a full-scale campaign.\u000a\u000aIn other words, Kyiv has officially accused Moscow of planning false-flag terrorism against its own people to justify a wider war against Russia\u2019s neighbor. This sounds like a bad conspiracy theory, not helped by the appropriation of \u201cfalse flag\u201d\u2014a perfectly normal and legitimate espionage term\u2014by tinfoil-wearing charlatans hawking male enhancement products.\u000a\u000aYet false flags exist in real life, and nobody is more proficient in this dark art than the Russians. This sort of dangerous provocation\u2014what the Russians call provokatsiya\u2014is ubiquitous in Kremlin spy operations, and they\u2019ve been employing them since the Imperial era more than a century ago. Indeed, anarchist terrorists in the last decades of the Tsar\u2019s rule\u2014especially the most deadly and accomplished ones\u2014had a bad habit of turning out to be agents provocateurs for the Tsar\u2019s secret police.\u000a\u000aThings got even worse under the Bolsheviks, who eagerly employed provocations against their enemies at home and abroad. The KGB became very accomplished at employing false-flag operations, including terrorism, to undermine Moscow\u2019s enemies. In a recent column, I unraveled one such operation in Cold War Germany, a Communist false-flag murder that had enormous political consequences\u2014all of them negative for the West.\u000a\u000aThese unpleasant practices continued after Communism\u2019s fall and the KGB\u2019s successors have employed false-flags in what they call \u201coperational games.\u201d One of them seems to have played a pivotal role in the coming of Vladimir Putin to power in the Kremlin. That notorious example was the bombing of four Russian apartment buildings in September 1999 that together killed almost 300 civilians and injured more than a thousand.\u000a\u000aThese terrorist attacks infuriated average Russians and gave the Kremlin a green light to renew its messy war against Chechen rebels, since the bombings were perpetrated by terrorists from Chechnya, according to Moscow. Of particular note, these attacks bolstered the profile and power of the country\u2019s newly appointed prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who had headed the FSB until only a few months before the bombings.\u000a\u000aThere was never convincing evidence that Chechens were behind these outrages, but there was considerable evidence that the FSB was. The best book on this sordid saga leaves little doubt that FSB officials blew up their own citizens to justify a new Chechen war and boost Putin. Several journalists who looked into the matter wound up dead under violent or mysterious circumstances.\u000a\u000aThe only question here is whether those Chekist false-flag bombers were acting on orders from the Kremlin or they went rogue\u2014which may not be answerable anytime soon, although I can confirm that our Intelligence Community knows much more about this ugly mystery than it has ever admitted publicly.\u000a\u000aThe notion that the FSB might commit acts of terrorism against Russians to justify war and aggression isn\u2019t only plausible, it\u2019s likely already happened under Putin. The SBU chief\u2019s comments therefore deserve to be taken seriously, particularly in light of the imminent Zapad 2017 military mega-exercises, the biggest display of the Kremlin\u2019s military might since the Cold War, right on the doorstep of NATO\u2014and Ukraine.\u000a\u000aPoland\u2019s defense minister, Antoni Macierewicz, recently called out Moscow for Zapad, terming it \u201cnot at all defensive, but aggressive and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d adding that, \u201caccording to information that has been reaching us, nearly 100,000 soldiers have been mobilized for these exercises\u201d\u2014not the mere 12,500 that Moscow has claimed.\u000a\u000aWarsaw has every right to be worried, given Putin\u2019s track record of aggression and Moscow\u2019s long history of invading Poland. However, the Poles are NATO members and can rely on collective Western security. Ukraine stands alone against Russia, so Kyiv has every right to be even more worried about what the Kremlin might do next.\u000a\u000aJohn Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer.

aVChocolate is rumored to be the food of the gods. It rivals wine, aged cheese and craft beers for its decadent appeal. Belgium is the chocolate capitol of the world and it is where, in 1926, the first Godiva chocolate boutique opened.\u000a\u000aEventually, Godiva was sold to Campbell Soup Company. And then, in November 2007, with annual sales of nearly $500 million, it was sold again, this time to Yildiz, a Turkish company.\u000a\u000aIn April 2017, Godiva quietly changed forever when Yildiz removed alcohol from the recipe.\u000a\u000aThe company was under tremendous pressure to do so. Because Turkey is a Muslim country, it would be natural to assume that the pressure was to remove the legendary icon, the naked likeness of Lady Godiva, whose story is as far from the tenets of Islam as one can get. According to legend, Lady Godiva rode nude through Coventry. She was so loved that no one would embarrass her or themselves by stealing a peak. The only person to look at lovely nude lady was a gent named Tom, hence the derivation of the expression \u201cPeeping Tom.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, surprisingly, it was not the image of Lady Godiva that insulted Muslims\u2019 sensibilities.\u000a\u000aInstead, uproar ensued because the confections were infused with booze, and Islam prohibits the consumption of alcohol.\u000a\u000aIronically, during prohibition in the United States, many specialty chocolates were confected with hollow centers, which were then injected with booze to satisfy the cravings of those who yearned for alcohol.\u000a\u000aBut Godiva wasn\u2019t hiding anything: They used alcohol in their recipes for flavor, not to achieve a high. Content was too low to get a buzz, and much of the alcohol evaporates during the cooking and the churning stages.\u000a\u000aA company certainly has the right to alter its recipe. The Coca Cola Company is a prime example. Coke constantly adjusts its recipe so that consumers do not become bored with its taste. And food industry experts will never forget Coke\u2019s infamous debacle of trying to replace Classic Coke with the failed \u201cNew Coke.\u201d\u000a\u000aLikewise, communities have the right to exert pressure on companies so that they can enjoy the product. For example, under the leadership of Rabbi Geffen, the Jewish community lobbied Coke to become certified Kosher, which it did in the 1920s.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not the change nor the taste that is troubling; It\u2019s the subterfuge. When a company changes a product, they need to acknowledge that change\u2014especially if it\u2019s a legendary product like Godiva chocolate.\u000a\u000aMicah Halpern is a political and foreign affairs commentator, author the \u201cThe Micah Report,\u201d and host of the weekly TV show \u201cThinking Out Loud w Micah Halpern.\u201d Follow him on twitter: @MicahHalpern

aVWhen it was first announced in May that Ryan Murphy would be using the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election as the inspiration for season 6 of his TV series American Horror Story, critics and fans of the show alike were trepidatious, to say the least. Why make them relive something that was so\u2026scary?\u000a\u000aBut when the show premiered on FX this past Tuesday, September 6, Murphy proved that his wacky idea of channeling such a pivotal (and traumatic) moment in our nation\u2019s history into art can not only be entertaining, but therapeutic, too. Following Murphy\u2019s lead is Mexican-born, New York-based artist Bosco Sodi, who is putting on a one-day-only political performance in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park on today, from 3 to 8 p.m.\u000a\u000a\u201cMuro\u201d in the making.\u000a\u000aThe project came to fruition thanks to the help of Sodi\u2019s Mexican friends living in the city\u2014each of them are accomplished individuals who work in creative industries. \u201cI wanted to create a wall made by Mexicans with Mexican earth,\u201d Sodi told The New York Times back in July. Yes, he is building a wall in a nod to President Trump\u2019s plan to construct a multi-billion dollar wall along the U.S./Mexico border. Though Sodi\u2019s asking his community to help de-construct this wall.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Art Newspaper, each of the 1,600 bricks used to build the 26-ft. long wall \u201cwere fired in Oaxaca and transported by truck along the same route taken by migrants who cross over into Texas from the town of Nuevo Laredo.\u201d He accurately titled the performance piece \u201cMuro\u201d (the Spanish word for wall). It\u2019s the artist\u2019s first piece on display to the public; consider this a preview for his upcoming debut show this November, at the Paul Kasmin Gallery in Chelsea.\u000a\u000aThe premise of the installation is to have spectators walking through the park take apart the wall brick-by-brick, a symbolic protest and retaliation to Donald Trump\u2019s maddening mission. Each brick has been signed by the artist and can be taken home, as a relic of the Trump resistance. Sodi\u2019s goal for the piece was to create \u201ca metaphoric and poetic action\u201d that would help break down both physical and mental walls. Come this afternoon, he just might succeed in doing that.

aVIf Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has his way, Jaime Lannister will depart Game of Thrones in a brilliant flash of dragon fire. \u201cIt has to be a dragon death,\u201d he tells me, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the dragons that get him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re on the third floor of Greenwich Steakhouse, the Village melting outside under Manhattan\u2019s first truly warm day of the year, sitting surrounded by wine racks at a table long enough for a Lannister\u2019s living room. Coster-Waldau, his Danish accent far more pronounced than it is in Westeros, his eyes a White Walker shade of piercing blue, eats a single cookie off a tiny round plate, something I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if it were not being done by the six-foot-two result of a sketch artist being asked to draw Prince Charming. This cookie should be baked with gold, and there should be hundreds more; thousands more; enough to make A Song of Ice and Fire author George RR Martin spend at least four pages describing them.\u000a\u000aCoster-Waldau is in town to promote Evan Katz\u2019s low-budget noir Small Crimes, streaming now on Netflix, but one doesn\u2019t get Jaime Lannister in a room without discussing HBO\u2019s fantasy mega-hit; and one doesn\u2019t discuss Game of Thrones, period, without eventually discussing death. Which is how we land on the actor\u2019s desire for his own character\u2014the Lannister family\u2019s stone-jawed golden boy, incestuous father of two with sister Cersei (Lena Headey), a.k.a. Kingslayer, Oathbreaker and a whole host of other unsavory epithets\u2014to wave his one-handed farewell to the consistently kill-happy series by being burnt to a crisp by Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) massive, CGI dragons.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust fried,\u201d he says, clearly relishing the idea. \u201cHe has to burn. Has to.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, whether this is speculation or spoiler is known only by an extraordinarily exclusive crew; the series, debuted in 2011 and quickly ballooned into a worldwide phenomenon, has since surpassed its A Song of Ice and Fire source material. When it returns in July for its penultimate season, we will be over The Wall and into the unknown, the plot-points existing for now only in the heads of the cast and crew, series co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and George RR Martin himself.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s something important to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: the man is a sharer, to say the least, perhaps the result of being raised in Tybjerg, a tiny village situated in the countryside of southern Zealand. Within an hour of meeting him, I knew the TV series the actor was currently hooked on (Silicon Valley, loved the premiere); I knew the poster that hung on his childhood bedroom wall (the album cover of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d); I heard the story of a young Coster-Waldau serenading his schoolmates with a Rod Stewart cover (\u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy,\u201d of course) and was filled in on some hot Tybjerg gossip from circa 1980 about the time the principal of his middle school\u2019s wife started an affair with another teacher. \u201cNo, no, it gets even better,\u201d Coster-Waldau says before I could interrupt, fully headed down memory lane at this point. (For the record, it did get better. Small-town Denmark scandal is my new favorite scandal).\u000a\u000aSo, surely, nabbing a few spoilers from the biggest show on television by conversation\u2019s end wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, would it? \u201cFor years there was the whole thing with \u2018book readers\u2019 who knew what was going to happen. But it is more intense now, because nobody knows,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cThere has been a couple times where I\u2019ve actually, by accident, said something I shouldn\u2019t have. But because nobody knows, they don\u2019t necessarily pick up on it.\u201d\u000a\u000aI get what he\u2019s saying; the anticipation for more Thrones\u2014both show and book series\u2014has reached such a fever pitch of online hypothesizing and fan theories that an actual correct guess would be lost in the noise like a musician playing the wrong note in concert.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you go online you can definitely read every plot point that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou can find the ending of Game of Thrones on the internet. It\u2019s there. But you wouldn\u2019t know. Of course, nobody really wants to know.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, I throw the journalism ethics book out the third floor Greenwich Steakhouse window to abruptly correct my interview subject; I\u2019d very much like to know, on the record, the ending of Game of Thrones. He laughs. \u201cMaybe I should try it one day. Just say, \u2018Yeah, here is exactly what happens.\u2019 You\u2019d probably just go, \u2018Pfffft, no, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s right, of course. There is no way Jaime Lannister actually dies by dragon fire, no way the actor who plays him just came out and told me because, hey, how would I even know?\u000a\u000aRight?\u000a\u000aThe look on his face at this point, so self-assuredly charming in victory, is so Lannister-esque I half expect him to pick up that cookie\u2014that one single cookie off that tiny, tiny plate\u2014with a hand made of solid gold.\u000a\u000aIn the odd-ball dark comedy Small Crimes, Coster-Waldau plays ex-police officer Joe Denton, a world-weary five o\u2019clock shadow with legs pretty much the exact diametric opposite aesthetically of Jaime Lannister\u2019s flowing hair\u2019d gallantry; where people call Jaime \u201cKingslayer,\u201d the press calls Joe \u201cSlash Cop,\u201d a nod to the knife-wielding assault charge that landed him a six-year prison sentence. We meet Joe fresh out of jail for a bloody, brutal little film that often manages to simultaneously be quite funny, in which Coster-Waldau spends a great deal of screen time getting his ass kicked with everything from a stun gun to a pair of nunchucks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love that stuff,\u201d the actor smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because he deserves it. What we tried to do, and I spoke to [writer-director Evan Katz] about this, I said \u2018we have to lean into that aspect of it, because it is such a dark story and Joe is such a scumbag.\u2019 You think it\u2019s going to be one of those movies where a guy turns his life around, and he then goes and makes every wrong decision you can possibly make. So you have to be able to laugh at him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe tried to find the humor even while he\u2019s getting beaten up. Like, when [co-star] Gary Cole tases me, it\u2019s like, you know\u2026\u201d Coster-Waldau trails off and instead convulses in his chair, tongue out and eyes bulging, in a comically over-the-top rendition of a man being tased in the stomach by well-known character actor Gary Cole.\u000a\u000aThat is another important thing to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: he\u2019s simultaneously animated and engaged, an interviewer\u2019s delight. He will answer with a specific story, a detailed childhood memory or thought-out rumination on life itself, and in lieu of an actual anecdote he\u2019ll act out an answer for you.\u000a\u000aPerfect example: When discussing his fondness for his truly immoral Small Crimes character\u2014and that fondness is delightfully palpable throughout\u2014Coster-Waldau begins by saying \u201ceven though Joe is suck a fuck-up, I still\u2026well I don\u2019t care for him but I still want to know what happens to him. I don\u2019t want to be his best buddy, but there\u2019s something about him. He\u2019s like, what\u2019s the word\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a loss, Coster-Waldau simply does a spot-on impression of a fishing lure staying afloat, bobbing relentlessly above the water\u2019s surface. \u201cJoe is like that,\u201d he goes on afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m back, I can still make it no matter what.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA running theme throughout Small Crimes is that abstract idea of \u201csecond chances\u201d; whether or not they exist, and what it then would mean to truly earn one.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do believe in second chances,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cGod knows I believe in third chances as well. But the thing is, do you believe you can actually change? Fundamentally change the person you are? I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when I press for specifics, a moment in time when the actor, be it professional or personal, was given a second chance, he draws a blank. He puts his face in his hand and thinks about it, really thinks about it because if Coster-Waldau is going to properly answer an interview question\u2014no, if he\u2019s going to offer a life lesson, he\u2019s going to find the right words. Right now, though, the only thing popping into his head is a 2014 film he starred in, quite literally titled A Second Chance.\u000a\u000aI posit, only half-jokingly, that perhaps he simply does not make mistakes.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I do. I do,\u201d he says. \u201cGod no, I have made mistakes. We all do. But I don\u2019t know about the whole idea that forgiveness is a one-off/ I\u2019ve gotten a lot of second chances. You kind of have to earn it. We have this weird belief, which is very fundamental to our culture, that forgiveness is to be given. You can just get it, you can be forgiven for anything. Which would be wonderful, because guilt is a bitch to carry around.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe brightens suddenly. \u201cI do remember one thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor launches into a story that occurred not in his career, or on the set of Game of Thrones, or even over the course of his now-19-year marriage to Greenlandic singer Nukaaka Coster-Waldau, but during his grade-school years. A classmate stole a Swedish exchange student\u2019s video game\u2014Coster-Waldau calls it \u201cone of those beep beep games,\u201d which is endlessly endearing\u2014which then ended up in his own possession.\u000a\u000a\u201cI couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of it,\u201d he remembers of harboring the contraband \u2018beep beep game.\u2019 \u201cI called another friend, and he said, \u2018You have to bring it to the principal.\u2019 It was beautiful, because it was so innocent. \u2018You have to.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe problem, Coster-Waldau tells me, is that the principal was \u201ca psychopath\u201d (one-third of the aforementioned scandalous affair, actually). But still, the young Coster-Waldau summoned his courage and returned the exchange student\u2019s console, and life in small-town Denmark moved on.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, no,\u201d Coster-Waldau laughs. \u201cThe principal actually made me feel terrible, like I was on my way to prison for probably the rest of my life. He kind of just took the game back and said \u2018you\u2019re a piece of shit, you little scumbag.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cMy point,\u201d he continues, now beaming, \u201cis that he did not give me a second chance. But just the fact that I did it actually made me feel better. It was the action, not the forgiveness. I knew that I did the right thing. Not him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich, oddly enough, brings us right back to Jaime Lannister.\u000a\u000aYou see, the incident that gave the character the title of \u201cKingslayer\u201d occurred before the events of Game of Thrones began; Jaime, still captain of the Kingsguard, drove a sword through the very king he swore to protect, Aerys II Targaryen. Which, yes, is not the best career move. What Jaime\u2019s detractors do not know is Aerys had given the order to ignite countless caches of wildfire hidden throughout the city, killing thousands of innocent people, when Jaime stepped in to stop him; a crucial fact we do not learn until a season 3 bath tub confession from Jaime to Gwendoline Christie\u2019s Brienne of Tarth.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this is true, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone? Why didn\u2019t you tell Lord Stark?\u201d asks Brienne, referring to Sean Bean\u2019s ultra-moral Eddark Stark.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?\u201d Jaime answers, one line of a performance that landed Coster-Waldau on many an Emmy Snubs list in 2013. \u201cHe judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, not to outright compare regicide with the theft of a middle-schooler\u2019s video game system, but there is a certain parallel. Jaime Lannister as a character lives a life condemned\u2014is \u201cOathbreaker\u201d really that far off from \u201clittle scumbag\u201d?\u2014because of a choice he made, that he and nearly he alone knows was right. It is, as Coster-Waldau said, the action that defines him, not anyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u000a\u000aFour seasons later, and this parallel still colors the way Coster-Waldau plays Jaime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat scene in season 3 was a very important moment,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe most important for Jaime, I think, was in that bath with Brienne. It was called \u2018Kissed by Fire,\u2019 that episode.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich is why,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI think Jaime should be killed by fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would be poetic, in its way. A perfect circle. Maybe a little\u2026too perfect? \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re watching next season. You\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, fuck.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s kidding, of course. Jaime Lannister isn\u2019t going to be burned to death in season seven of Game of Thrones. That is not, as Coster-Waldau joked before, \u201cexactly what happens.\u201d Right?\u000a\u000aPffft, no, it\u2019s not.

aVWe\u2019ve all heard the age-old saying, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d Located nearly 4,000 miles away from the Eternal City lies Saadiyat (Happiness) Island, in the Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi. A glittery cosmopolis, it\u2019s home to the controversial Louvre Abu Dhabi, which is set to finally open its doors after 10 years of planning and delays on November 11. The news was announced at a press conference held yesterday.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt a time when culture is under attack\u2026 this is our joint response,\u201d French Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen told reporters at the news conference after the opening date was revealed.\u000a\u000aWhile \u201cculture\u201d might be perceived to be under attack in today\u2019s political climate, a protest group, the Gulf Labor Artist Coalition, has been claiming throughout the duration of this project (and others on Saadiyat Island) that it\u2019s the workers employed to build the structure that have borne the harsh price of modern-day development. The group have made it their mission to advocate for migrant worker rights during the construction taking place on the island. As with at many building sites in the UAE, reports were rampant that the laborers (many of whom paid a fee to be contracted onto the project) were subject to security monitoring and overcrowded living conditions, while being locked into the construction site, unable to come and go of their own free will.\u000a\u000aThe ultra modern structure designed by Pritzker-winning architect Jean Nouvel made headlines in 2007 after construction was famously halted, due to the worldwide economic crisis. The project continued to receive public scrutiny when it was revealed that three of the Western world\u2019s leading cultural institutions\u2014New York University, the Guggenheim, and the Louvre\u2014would establish respective entities in Abu Dhabi to form a high-brow cultural theme park, despite several human rights reports that showed a severe deterioration of liberties for both laborers and women throughout the UAE.\u000a\u000aThe 23 permanent galleries that are set to open in November are said to resemble motifs of traditional Arabic medinas and reference the design of Arab settlements. And by the time it opens its doors at the end of the year, the museum will have successfully borrowed 300 artworks from historic French art institutions: the Muse d\u2019Orsay, Centre Pompidou, and the Louvre.\u000a\u000aSo what can we expect to see on display? Pieces include Andy Warhol\u2019s Big Electric Chair, Claude Monet\u2019s Saint-Lazare, a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, Mesopotamian Gulf artifacts, and other masterworks. What its attendance will be like, in light of the museum\u2019s many controversies, remains to be seen.

Black Frame Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 30 Leadership: Brian Phillips, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 With clients that read like the guest list at a party where you won't get in, Black Frame's built a mystique as a luxury PR firm with one foot firmly planted downtown. Think Visionaire, Rodarte, Opening Ceremony and uber-interior-designers Yabu Pushelberg. Bonus points for naming its website Framenoir.\u000a\u000a49. Allison + Partners Last Year\u2019s List: 41 Employees: 300 Leadership: Scott Allison, co-founder, chairman and CEO Revenue: $46 million Founded: 2001 Despite the firm's SF roots, Allison + Partners' center of gravity has shifted to the Big Apple, now home to the largest team in its global network. Talent's where the firm is ruling; hires have landed from places like Edelman and Ogilvy. And the client roster's been fattened by the likes of Samsung, Adecco and Seventh Generation.\u000a\u000a48. The Magrino Agency Last Year\u2019s List: 47 Employees: N/A Leadership: Susan Magrino, chairman and CEO; Allyn Magrino, president and COO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 Susan and Allyn Magrino have built a lifestyle-PR powerhouse, with clients who now involve them in brand strategy before a product even launches. It's also a matchmaking pioneer, connecting, say, Richard Meier with Dom Perignon for a special edition. Despite brutal competition from upstarts like M18, the firm's more than held its own, with a food-hospitality-fashion stable that includes Baccarat, Lavazza, Hilton properties and Turnberry Isle.\u000a\u000a47. Boneau/Bryan-Brown Last Year\u2019s List: 44 Employees: 16 Leadership: Chris Boneau, Adrian Bryan-Brown, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 More than 200 BBB clients have won Tony Awards, cementing its place as the top name in theatre PR. Broadway\u2019s biggest hits, including The Book of Mormon and Jersey Boys, rely on the firm\u2019s smart strategy\u2014and upcoming partnerships with Cirque du Soleil and Nickelodeon mean BBB clients will continue to be conversation starters. Still, we're watching to see how DKC's acquisition of O & M affects the category (see DKC listing).\u000a\u000a46. High10 Media Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Lisa Dallos, CEO; Evan Strome, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 Lisa Dallos' media-centric firm is the only one whose team includes one employee in Maine and one in Tel Aviv. Whatever\u2014the firm's been killing it for media brands from Adweek to the Webby and Clio Awards to The Hill and New Republic magazines. And if you're wondering why the sale of a Manhattan gay bar rag to an L.A. media group was featured in the Hollywood Reporter this year, thank Ms. Dallos.\u000a\u000a45. APCO Worldwide Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Margery Kraus, founder and executive chairman Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 What started as a wonky D.C. agency has mushroomed into a brainy powerhouse with clients like IKEA, Wyndham hotels, and Microsoft, and leadership like ex-WSJ editor Kevin Goldman; from a staff of five, its NYC office now employs 50 and counting.\u000a\u000a44. Baltz & Company Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 29 Leadership: Phillip Baltz, founder and president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1998 With a profile so low he's practically underground, Phillip Baltz prefers to let his work do the talking. You would, too, with superstar restaurant clients like Dirt Candy, Pearl & Ash, Jonathan Waxman\u2019s JAMS, Beauty and Essex, Kat & Theo and...Chipotle.\u000a\u000a43. Dukas Linden Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Richard Dukas, chairman and CEO; Seth Linden, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2002 Dukas may have cost John Paulson $500 million this year. That wasn't its retainer; DLPR client Carson Block, a prominent short-seller, famously took down Chinese timber outfit Sino-Forest Corp., which subsequently tanked. Dukas itself had a better 2015, coming off the best stretch in its 13-year history\u2014and cracking $5 million for the first time. Broadcast is where the agency shines; if you're ever tuned into Bloomberg TV, CNBC or Fox, you've probably seen one of the 60-plus segments the firm books monthly for clients like Raymond James, EisnerAmper and Eaton Vance.\u000a\u000a42. The Peggy Siegal Company Last Year\u2019s List: 40 Employees: N/A Leadership: Peggy Siegal, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 If you want your movie to get into the Oscar race, it helps to have Peggy Siegal by your side. This year, the queen of film PR is handling publicity on both coasts for Spotlight and The Danish Girl, among others. Her secret? Lunchtime Q&As with top filmmakers, held at venues like the 21 Club. Ms. Siegal refers to these events as \u201ca press conference wrapped around a piece of chicken.\u201d\u000a\u000a41. PR Consulting Last Year\u2019s List: 30 Employees: N/A Leadership: Pierre Rougier, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 PR Consulting's website simply lists its clients. Since the agency's Sphinx-like about itself, we'll let the roster do the talking for founder Pierre Rougier: Hood by Air, Dior, Raf Simons, Rick Owens, LVMH, Dries Van Noten, Narciso Rodriguez, Christopher Kane, Versace. Oh, and Forever 21 and Joe Fresh. The firm's also expanded into food and hospitality, with Andre Balazs a notable client\u2014and it may be courting Grindr as well.\u000a\u000a40. Goodman Media Last Year\u2019s List: 19 Employees: 25 Leadership: Tom Goodman, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1996 Flashier firms may get the glory, but Tom Goodman's 25-person shop continues to get clients that matter, from The Economist to Grand Central Terminal to the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. A complete New York insider, founder Mr. Goodman surprised more than a few people by opening an office in Boston this year.\u000a\u000a39. Golin Last Year\u2019s List: 36 Employees: 1,000-plus Leadership: Fred Cook, CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 Golin likes to call its reps "nice guys who kick ass," and that was certainly true this year, as its campaigns focused on positivity, but still got plenty of eyeballs. Among the firm's 2015 triumphs: partnering with Toyota for the Special Olympics World Games (Golin was the brains behind that viral Google Doodle) and rolling out the McDonald\u2019s All Day Breakfast campaign.\u000a\u000a38. Nicholas & Lence Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 39 Employees: 12 Leadership: Cristyne Nicholas, CEO; George Lence, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2007 A quintessentially New York agency founded by deeply connected insiders, this firm represents city institutions like Michael Jordan's Steakhouse in Grand Central, the forthcoming New York Wheel on Staten Island, and Key Brand, the leading theater ticket seller, which owns brands like Broadway Box and Broadway.com. Does it get more New York than literally repping the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Foundation? Naturally, big city clients sometimes bring big city problems -- the Carnegie Deli has been closed since April when it was found to have an illegal gas hookup. But others\u2014like 2015 NASL Champions The NY Cosmos and Brookfield, the developer who led a successful opening of Brookfield Place and dipped a toe in Brooklyn\u2014show that an NYC-focused firm can punch way above its weight.\u000a\u000a37. MWW Last Year\u2019s List: 20 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Kempner, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1986 MWW has its feelers in just about every sector of PR\u2014its many clients with commercial appeal include Verizon, Walgreens and JetBlue. It\u2019s also entered some areas other agencies fear to tread\u2014its LGBT wing, which represents It Gets Better, among others, looked particularly prescient after the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage equality ruling.\u000a\u000a36. Nasty Little Man Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 6 Leadership: Steve Martin, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 This firm may only have six employees, but its supernova clientele (Paul McCartney, David Bowie, U2) proves that in NYC PR, size doesn\u2019t always matter. Mr. Martin can be ferocious in defending his acts from unflattering coverage, including from his bte noir, the Observer\u2019s own Tim Sommer, but they love him for it. The Foo Fighters thought they were in big trouble when Dave Grohl broke his leg on the band\u2019s 20th anniversary tour, but once NLM rebranded it as the \u201cBroken Leg\u201d tour, the rockers continued to sell out stadiums.\u000a\u000a35. Paul Wilmot Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 32 Employees: N/A Leadership: Paul Wilmot, managing partner and chief executive Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 Paul Wilmot's august fashion and beauty firm always manages to stay cool by choosing clients carefully; this year, it lent its cachet to client Parlux Fragrances, creators of new scents from Rihanna and Sean Combs. Wilmot's forever relationships with Kate Spade, H&M and Lane Bryant also mean its third decade is already looking as strong as its first two.\u000a\u000a34. Brunswick Group Last Year\u2019s List: 29 Employees: N/A Leadership: Steven Lipin, senior partner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1987 Brunswick doesn't divulge client lists, but its reputation as an 800-pound gorilla in financial communications precedes it. This year, the multinational firm added former Bloomberg editor Laurie Hays to its NYC office, and its let-our-hair-down digital/creative subsidiaries like MerchantCantos, Brunswick Arts and Blaise Projects keep cranking.\u000a\u000a33. KCD Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Ed Filipowski, worldwide president and chief strategist; Julie Mannion, president of creative services Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 KCD is a fashion Goliath whose industry-defining clients include style-section habitus like Alexander Wang, Balmain, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang and Tory Burch. Along with publicity, the agency produces shows, which means it wields serious power; KCD decides where everyone's seated.\u000a\u000a32. ID-PR Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 100 Leadership: Kelly Bush Novak, founder and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1993 The ubiquity of client Serena Williams this summer\u2014how many magazine covers did she get?\u2014was just one example of ID\u2019s juice. Building on its roots in celeb/entertainment PR, where it still shines, the firm's making serious inroads with consumer and luxury brands, from Coca-Cola, AOL and Marriott to Westfield World Trade Center and Tiffany. Philanthropy's the next frontier: this year saw massive campaigns for deep-pocketed do-gooders like Unicef and Sean Penn's J/P HRO.\u000a\u000a30. 5W PR Last Year\u2019s List: 35 Employees: 125 Leadership: Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO Revenue: $21.5 million Founded: 2003 A generalist firm with fingers in the right pies\u2014from health care and hedge funds to tech and travel\u20145W's roster includes uber-New Yorky brands like Duane Reade, the Greater NY Taxi Association and Derek Jeter's Stop!t, along with global heavyweights like Unilever, L'Oreal and Krups. Founder Ronn Torossian claims the firm's revenue could double within five years; we don't doubt it. He also brokered an unlikely peace between Mayor de Blasio and client Sergeant\u2019s Benevolent Association.\u000a\u000a29. Sunshine Sachs Last Year\u2019s List: 1 Employees: 154 Leadership: Ken Sunshine, Shawn Sachs, Heather Lylis, Keleigh Thomas Morgan, partners Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 How could they? That was the reaction to Sunshine Sachs' much-publicized Wikipedia screwup. It's a shame that the incident defined the agency's year, since last year's No. 1 firm is still having an incredible ride with giant nonprofit clients, A+ celebrities and massive growth in live events, like iHeartRadio's nationwide festivals. But it\u2019ll be a while before chatter stops about the Wikipedia episode.\u000a\u000aThey may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world. Hotels, its original client base, still bed down with M18 in droves. Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a11.

Tech, lifestyle, sports \u2014 the list goes on, which is why Cassidy\u2019s vision led the firm over the $50 million mark this year for the first time, a 12 percent increase over 2015.\u000a\u000aThere may still be agencies, somewhere, practicing public relations the old fashioned way, where press releases, pitching and parties define the scope of work.\u000a\u000aBut the firms that populate this year\u2019s PR Power 50 are part of a thrilling revolution that\u2019s transforming public relations into the most powerful engine in the great media-communications complex.\u000a\u000aFirms are creating client stories, not just telling them. They\u2019re not just guarding reputations, but active partners in nurturing them.\u000a\u000aPerhaps most significantly, they\u2019re breaking down boundaries to become key partners across the marketing spectrum, muscling in on territory once dominated by ad agencies, digital firms and content producers.\u000a\u000aAt a time when content reigns, \u201cPublic relations agencies are now regarded as stewards of the whole communications strategy,\u201d says Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick (No. 2 on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list). \u201cPR practitioners have never been held in higher regard.\u201d\u000a\u000aEver-expanding opportunities across the marketing spectrum make this \u201cthe most exciting time there\u2019s ever been for the business,\u201d says Don Baer, worldwide chair and CEO of Burson-Marsteller (No. 17). \u201cEveryone is veering into everyone else\u2019s lane. And if you have the creativity, and the ability to execute, it\u2019s a time of great possibilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat matters most is who owns a great idea, agrees Sean Cassidy, CEO of DKC, the No. 1 agency on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list.\u000a\u000a\u201cClients will pay you now for a whole scope of services that you never would have done 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Cassidy says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re winning now is large-scale assignments. You\u2019re developing multi-platform communications plans with wide content, owned media, social pieces. We\u2019ve got a branding arm that\u2019s creating collateral and advertising, and we\u2019re doing more events than ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore firms are also building their own synergies with standalone agencies within agencies. At celebrity power shop PMK*BNC, a mini-firm called Vowel is creating viral content through which the agency\u2019s superstar celebrity clients often get paired with big brands in the PMK stable. A now-legendary piece for Audi starring Zachary Quinto and the late Leonard Nimoy was unleashed before the last Star Trek movie.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was wonderful, creative digital content that was storyboarded start to finish under our roof,\u201d says Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of PMK*BNC (No. 8). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of freedom out there for you and your clients. You just have to know what trail you want to go on.\u201d PMK markets Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cLenny Letter\u201d, which has become a huge viral hit in an area where a traditional firm wouldn\u2019t have ventured even five years ago.\u000a\u000aAn unintended consequence of this push and pull\u2014convergence and diffusion\u2014has been the resurgence of legacy agencies, which many had dismissed as dinosaurs once the landscape started shifting a few years ago.\u000a\u000aInstead, they learned to adapt, meshing cool new tools and lingo with their own gravitas as the grownups in the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe bring the judgment and experience that goes along with strategic thinking,\u201d says Mr. Baer of Burson, which launched a content arm called StudioB this year. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seasoning it with data, creativity and deep knowledge of media landscape. We\u2019re moving forward very assertively.\u201d\u000a\u000aSixty-seven-year-old Ruder Finn (No. 10), not long ago one of the stodgiest of the big players, has reinvented itself as a hip think tank, where clients get help with employee engagement, recruitment and even how their businesses are organized. \u201cWe call it ideation behind transformation,\u201d says CEO Kathy Bloomgarden, one of the few agency heads with a Ph.D. \u201cWe work to transform companies to make them more attractive to stakeholders both inside and outside. We sometimes help them change their culture.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll of it comes back to storytelling, says Weber Shandwick\u2019s Mr. Polansky, which is why PR firms should continue to rule.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreative is still king,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are looking for big ideas that are going to move the needle for their businesses, have an impact on how people think about their brands and influence decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s list reflects that.\u000a\u000aA word on methodology: Unlike other rankings, the Observer doesn\u2019t rely solely on size or revenue. We visit offices, meet agency leaders, confer with fellow journalists and keep an eye on news. The PR Power 50 list is as much about mojo, influence, innovation and chutzpah\u2014but not too much, as last year\u2019s No. 1 winner learned\u2014as it is about billables.\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t that what the business is about, too?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVAn ongoing puzzlement\u2014right up there with where the hell the G train disappears to on weekends\u2014is why, of Puccini\u2019s mature works, the blatant, noisy and violently antifeminist Turandot should get so much play in opera houses, whereas the thrilling and heartfelt La Fanciulla del West has been generally ignored for more than a century.\u000a\u000aThere may be reason to hope that period of neglect is drawing to a close, though, since Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s revival of this opera at the Rose Theater won a roaring, stamping ovation, even though the New York City Opera\u2019s performance of the piece was not much better than okay.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Puccini took a risk with the subject matter for this opera: the \u201cWest\u201d of the title is California during the Gold Rush era, and the central love story is between Minnie, the owner of a saloon, and Johnson, a Sacramento dude who turns out to be the notorious bandit Ramerrez. So determined is Minnie to set her lover on the path of righteousness that she ends up challenging the lecherous Sheriff Rance to a game of draw poker, with her virtue staked against Johnson\u2019s life.\u000a\u000aWhat elevates this melodramatic material is primarily Puccini\u2019s music, which employs shimmering whole-tone harmonies to evoke the wide-open spaces and infinite possibilities of the American frontier. But there is also a fascinating dramatic motif at work: in this alien land, the miners who frequent Minnie\u2019s bar weep with homesickness.\u000a\u000aThe happy ending of this work is bittersweet, and therefore even more heartbreaking than the straightforwardly tragic finales of La Bohme or Madama Butterfly. Nobody dies in a literal sense, and yet the beginning of a new life necessarily means the end of an old one. The miners, numb with grief at the loss of their beloved Minnie, are reduced to sobbing \u201cmai pi\u2026 mai pi!\u201d (nevermore!).\u000a\u000aEven if NYCO bit off a bit more than they could chew with this show, they are to be lauded for their audacity. The lengthy chorus parts and the many supporting roles were taken with vigor and thrilling attack. The orchestra made mighty noises by the skin of their teeth under the blunt direction of James Meena, which compensated in large part for a bare-bones staging by Ivan Stefanutti.\u000a\u000aThe two leads, Kristin Sampson as Minnie and Jonathan Burton as Johnson, boasted big, muscular voices with top B\u2019s and C\u2019s many a Met A-lister would kill for. As protagonists of a drama concerned with such important themes as love and redemption, though, they were disappointingly smaller than life. (And it didn\u2019t help they were styled so dreadfully, denim culottes for her and dun-colored pleather chaps for him.)\u000a\u000aSimilarly, baritone Kevin Short ranted excitingly as Rance, but it was hard to take seriously all his swanning around in a fur coat from the Cruella de Vil collection.\u000a\u000aHowever, in the most prominent of the opera\u2019s cameos, baritone Alexander Birch Elliott was quite simply perfect as Sonora, inhabiting his duster and cowboy boots with the testosterone-fueled ease of a young Sam Elliott. His molten baritone vaulted through the climactic phrase of the entire opera, \u201cLe tue parole sono di Dio\u201d (Minnie, your words are from God), convincing the lynch mob to pardon Johnson for Minnie\u2019s sake. Don\u2019t ask me what happened after that, because I was blinded with tears.\u000a\u000aWhat NYCO puts on stage is by no means an ideal Fanciulla, but it does leave you reflecting on joy and regret on the subway ride home. Any opera that does that is more than worth seeing.

aVIf you ask Alison Brie, pro wrestling\u2014that confounding mix of live theater, improv, athletics and body oil\u2014can be summed up in three words. \u201cTuck your chin,\u201d she says, in the infectiously high-spirited voice that spawned a voiceover career to rival the Community and Mad Men star\u2019s live-action resume. \u201cTuck your chin, always. Or else you slam the back of your head. In more complicated moves, you can break your neck. So tuck your chin. It\u2019s the key to everything we learned.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow, exactly, did straight-A Annie Edison come to be an expert in safely slamming onto a canvas? The answer is GLOW, a new Netflix original from Liz Flahive and Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan that chronicles the rise in the 1980s of the real-life upstart organization known as the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (if you don\u2019t have time for Brett Whitcomb\u2019s stellar documentary, settle for this 15-minute montage of every G.L.O.W. wrestler\u2019s signature rap intro and remember to thank me later). Brie stars as Ruth, a struggling, out-of-work actress who finds purpose, and a steady gig, inside the squared circle.\u000a\u000aLike wrestling itself, GLOW is a lot of things at once. An ensemble comedy dressed up in spandex. A meditation on the strength of the female body. A look at what\u2019s changed about racism and sexism since the 1980s and, more importantly, what has remained exactly the same.\u000a\u000aHonestly, define GLOW how you\u2019d like. Just don\u2019t use the word \u201cfake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018Fake.\u2019 That is the biggest misconception about pro wrestling,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cSo many people have asked me \u2018but the ring is basically a trampoline, right?\u2019 No. No! It\u2019s planks of wood that have a little give with metal in between. I have such a deep respect for it now. For the athleticism, for the showmanship. I certainly get very defensive when people use \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018pro wrestling\u2019 in the same sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer voice drops, becoming far more Macho Man Randy Savage than Vincent Adultman. \u201cI\u2019m immediately like, \u2018I will take you down!\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat deep respect came courtesy of a four-week crash course prior to production that saw the entire cast\u2014including American Gods MVP Betty Gilpin and resident Mr. Robot hacker Sunita Mani\u2014learning lockups and back bumps from Chavo Guerrero Jr. of the generation-spanning Guerrero wrestling dynasty. It was, Brie says, as grueling as it was emotional; by the time production began, GLOW\u2019s cast was bonded by a shared desire not to drop a co-star on her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of wrestling is about working together, and nurturing your partner. Their life is in your hands as much as yours is in theirs. And there\u2019s a big leap between learning and \u2018now you just sort of have to do the moves,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cYou can only really talk through this stuff for so long until it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., flip over and land on your back.\u2019 There\u2019s really not a halfway version of that.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s another key thing,\u201d she continues, practically a seasoned ring veteran speaking to a rookie. \u201cCommitment in the ring. When you go halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the course our conversation it became clear that professional wrestling\u2014\u201creal\u201d or not\u2014has more in common with Hollywood than you would imagine. The bruises, the boiling down to barest stereotypes, even the occasional spandex requirement. If you go to become an actor halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u000a\u000aTo nab the role of Ruth in GLOW, Brie went anything but halfway.\u000a\u000aWhen Community concluded after six seasons (but no movie), the actress took a full year to read a pile of network pilots but finding nothing to pique her interest. \u201cA lot of the characters I was getting sent for network TV seemed very similar to parts I\u2019ve played before,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted different. \u2018Unique\u2019 was the main word I kept stressing to people.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe parallels to GLOW\u2019s Ruth\u2014an actress searching not just for work but also an identity change, saved by the sudden appearance of a wrestling show\u2014are uncanny, right down to the fact that the studio and producers wanted nothing to do with her. \u201cOf course, the show I\u2019d found and really wanted to do, they didn\u2019t want me for, at all,\u201d Brie says and laughs. \u201cIn fact, I think they were against it. Not only were they not certain, they were adamantly against me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they thought I was edgy enough,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve played these real apple pie characters. I look a certain way. I was looking to change the dialogue about the work I was doing, but they were not privy to that information. So they looked at my rsum and went, \u2018That is not what we\u2019re picturing.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aBrie disagreed. While GLOW\u2019s creative department saw Mad Men\u2019s Trudy Campbell and heard Unikitty from The Lego Movie, the actress herself had a different picture in her head, a fighter with big hair and bigger biceps similar to Sigourney Weaver in Alien (once Brie was cast, she actually did bring a photo of Ripley to hair department head Theraesa Rivers). And she fought. First, to simply get into the audition room, then across several follow-ups with producers Kohan and Flahive, a sojourn to Toronto to get on tape with Gilpin and a return trip Los Angeles for yet another round of auditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was like \u2018pre-read? Yeah! I\u2019ll be there. Anything. I\u2019ll record myself on tape. Whatever,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cI think at every point they could feel my desperation growing.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs luck would have it, desperation is a staple of Ruth\u2019s personality\u2014of every character on GLOW, in her own way. \u201cRuth is a person who was just tired of feeling invisible,\u201d Brie says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more like Ruth than while I was auditioning for the show. And they saw it. I\u2019ve heard [Liz Flahive] and [executive-producer Carly Mensch] say it: \u2018We were watching you transform into the character as you were fighting for the show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAs it turns out, the Ruth we get through GLOW\u2019s debut season could only be played by Brie, and the show would tell a different story without her. The actress remembers something Flahivi told her, before they had even met in person. \u201cShe said, \u2018this is a show about women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 \u201d Which is true; GLOW\u2019s cast runs the gamut\u2014color, size, shape\u2014of what a woman can look like. To position Brie, smallest of them all, at the center says a good deal about the relationship between a person\u2019s size and their capacity to stay strong.\u000a\u000aWhich didn\u2019t make the bumps feel better. But it helped.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wrestling really became all about fearlessness,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hesitate. You had to just make a decision and do it, do things that were very scary for all of us. But being forced to overcome those fears in an instant, essentially in front of a group of strangers, really empowered all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aSound advice, for anyone looking to leap into the rigorous trials of Hollywood or simply dive off the top turnbuckle. It\u2019s about fearlessness.\u000a\u000aJust remember to tuck your chin.

aVIf you gave one human being complete access to all the software that runs your home, flooded the place with cameras and mics and let her watch you and talk to you 24/7, could she outperform Amazon Alexa or Google Home\u2018s artificial intelligence? That\u2019s the question tech artist Lauren McCarthy is asking with her new project, LAUREN.\u000a\u000aLAUREN is a performance art piece in which McCarthy will build \u201chuman intelligent smart homes.\u201d That is, she will sit at her desk, wait for commands and help out in all the ways she can, remotely. She\u2019ll raise interesting questions about what artificial intelligence can do. For example, if a user asks Lauren what the temperature is outside, she might give the answer a bit more slowly than Alexa would, but if you ask her whether the outfit you\u2019re wearing sends the right message for a first-time business meeting, she can actually offer a reasonable opinion.\u000a\u000aIn the late 1800s, as railroads started to criss-cross the nation, steel drivers were men who used hammers to drive explosives into rocks in order to dig tunnels. Eventually, steam-power was used to create machine hammers that replaced manual steel drivers. This replacement gave rise to the legend of John Henry, who died proving a man could drive steel faster and better than a machine.\u000a\u000aMcCarthy\u2019s experiment isn\u2019t likely to be that stressful, but she isn\u2019t making it easy on herself either.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy art is basically thinking about: What are the systems we use to be a person and interact with other people and will technology save all of our problems or cause many more?\u201d McCarthy said in a new video from Y Combinator (above), where she discussed LAUREN and some of her past work.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been really obsessed with all this home automation stuff, and thinking about Alexa and products like that, like Google Home,\u201d she said. According to Edison Research, most families that have one of these smart speakers would not want to go back to life without it.\u000a\u000aMcCarthy found it interesting that technology like Google Glass was so swiftly rejected while the Alexa and its imitators have been almost unquestioningly adopted. For her, to enter into and become pervasive in the home seems like a radical idea, because \u201cthe home is the place where you first learn how to be a person,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe artist will completely devote herself to this performance during each of the periods she serves as the home assistant for each household. It will begin with a brief in-person on-boarding conversation. McCarthy will also need to visit the homes to set up all her equipment. She expects in most cases that she will serve as the home assistant for about three days, depending on how long her participants are game to have her. She plans to sleep when her subjects sleep and take breaks when they aren\u2019t at home, but otherwise she plans to be basically as available as Alexa or Google Home is.\u000a\u000aInterested participants can apply to take part in the project by signing up at her website. She has a number of demo testimonials up there that suggest she will try to insert a human element into performance, perhaps not simply obeying her participants but also trying to influence their behavior. It\u2019s the emotional work that humans can do, she contends, that machines can\u2019t replace.\u000a\u000aThe UCLA Media Arts professor is engaging in this project not as a commercial enterprise but as an aspect of her art practice. Like most contemporary art, it\u2019s meant to raise questions and stimulate conversation. It\u2019s not a minimum viable product of any kind. McCarthy knows that this approach would be impossible to scale. Much like the myth of John Henry, that\u2019s not really the point.\u000a\u000aMcCarthy\u2019s art practice has been all about provocative, tough to scale experiments. We spoke with her in 2014. Her most famous project has probably been \u201cSocial Turkers,\u201d in which she paid people on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service to text her instructions for how she could be more winning on first dates.\u000a\u000aShe explains that she often finds people are eager to believe in the potential of some of her wildest technological experiments. \u201cA lot of these products are working into people\u2019s desire to buy into things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey kind of want to believe it.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen you think about it, that predisposition puts inventors at an advantage when they want to insert some invasive new gadget into our lives. How else can we explain the fact that Apple Watches haven\u2019t completely disappeared?

aV\u201cThe amazing thing about La Perla is we do lingerie, nightwear and sleepwear, so we can encompass your entire life. From the time you wake up in your pajamas, go to the office wearing our suits, to evening wear and then back to your nighty, we encompass it all,\u201d La Perla\u2019s creative director Julia Haart explained, while curled up in a round leather booth in the Lamb\u2019s Club. The designer was wearing a red zip-up hoodie and an insanely high pair of heeled boots of her own design.\u000a\u000aIt was a chilly February morning, directly following the designer\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 runway extravaganza, where Naomi Campbell donned a silky nighty, Lindsey Wixson walked in a bright purple bralette, Sasha Pivovarova rocked a plaid skirt suit, and Kendall Jenner closed the show in a nearly see-through gown. The models lounged on the couches, chairs and balconies, in a number of different rooms of the \u201cLa Perla Manor\u201d set, before descending a grand staircase and strutting the runway. Taking place on the first day of New York Fashion Week, this grand gesture was an impressive way to start off the season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked the casting agent Piergiorgio [Del Moro] for diversity. I do not want to see 40 white girls, that\u2019s not the world we live in and that\u2019s not the people I want to sell to. I want to dress every woman. I also wanted women with personality. Don\u2019t just give me beautiful women; give me sexy, fun, confident, strong women!\u201d she explained.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Vogue said it best in their runway review. \u201cShe is presumably catering to those women that might tune into the Victoria\u2019s Secret show (as it happens, a number of her Fall cast are also Angels) but would never actually buy Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014all La Perla, all the way,\u201d they wrote. Surely, the Victoria\u2019s Secret formula is there: world-class models, an over-the-top set and plenty of lacy lingerie. But there was more.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very honored, it\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Haart replied, when asked about the comparison. \u201cThe only thing is that Victoria\u2019s Secret is a lingerie show, mine was a ready-to-wear show, so that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges. We may have come from a lingerie background but we have taken it to the next level.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s true. La Perla is a go-to for sexy lace bras and barely there underwear with luxury price tags, but they also offer slinky evening gowns and blazers with wireless bra cups built in. Not only do you factor in your clothing size with a La Perla ready-to-wear purchase, but your bra size is considered, too. Have you ever bought a jacket in a size 38 cup AB? Or a shirt in a 44 cup CD?\u000a\u000aHowever, the starring roles belong to the fabrics used by the company, these firm foundations are truly something to marvel over. Haart has incorporated stretch into nearly every material, offering a silk dress with 10 percent Elastane that is wrinkle-resistant. She has also developed a fine stretch-lace that actually moves with the body. Haart wants women to feel as comfortable in their clothing as they feel in their lingerie. She doesn\u2019t believe that women should have to choose between looking good and feeling comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of my materials have stretch, so you can literally kickbox in everything,\u201d she semi-joked. \u201cNot that you\u2019re necessarily going to want to kickbox in an evening gown, but if the mood instructs you\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAppointed to the creative director role in August 2016, it is clear that the buxom but petite Haart knows a thing or two about finding flattering clothing to fit her frame. She had actually worked with the brand before this past summer; advising the team on two accessories collaborations, starting with the Fall/Winter 2016 season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had my own shoe line, so I first started making shoes for La Perla, as a collaboration. Then it was \u2018Julia can you design handbags?\u2019 And \u2018Julia can you design men\u2019s shoes?\u2019 Eventually, \u2018Can you help with the collection?\u2019 And here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince being installed in this top creative role, Haart has cemented her status as a power player. In December, she co-hosted a celebration for a Goop pop-up in Santa Monica. Gwyneth Paltrow showed up to the dinner in a black corset suit and leggings from La Perla (Ms. P also made a rare front row appearance at the brand\u2019s February fashion show).\u000a\u000aLa Perla also co-sponsored Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2018s Los Angeles celebration of the 150 Most Fashionable Women in January 2017, where Haart appeared on the red carpet sandwiched between Kendall Jenner and Liu Wen (who, if you recall, both walked in recent fashion shows for Victoria\u2019s Secret and La Perla). These two models also starred in the latest La Perla ad campaign, donning suits in celestial prints, dresses decorated with sultry lace and corset details; they shared the campaign with Isabeli Fontana. Shot by Steven Klein and artistically directed by Fabien Baron, this was Haart\u2019s inaugural campaign for the brand. The theme behind the shoot? \u201cThe liberation of every woman from the need to suffer for beauty,\u201d of course. Despite the clothing, the ads still offer a little something for the lingerie fans faithful to the brand since its inception in 1954.\u000a\u000aAlso promoting the ready-to-wear range was the brand\u2019s new Milan flagship, which opened this past fashion week. Located on via Montenapoleone, the new marble-clad store doubled in size, spanning 2,583 square feet over two floors. Haart admitted that the moving to a bigger store was necessary for accommodating her expanded clothing collections. This is understandable when you realize her Fall/Winter 2017 collection contained a whopping 225 pieces.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone keeps asking me \u2018Who is the La Perla woman?\u2019 And I hate that question so much. Who am I to determine what a woman should look like?\u201d Haart expressed in exasperation, back in New York. She went on to explain that she is not precious about how say, a stylist might dress an actress in her designs, many of which are simple tailored staples. She is unconcerned if her looks are paired with other brands, she just wants the La Perla pieces to look good. Haart has set out to dress every woman, to help them embrace their curves and the make them feel comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to make women feel more confident with themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to look in the mirror and say damn I look fine. That\u2019s my only job.

aVRemember \u201cBBC Dad,\u201d the college professor whose TV interview about South Korea was interrupted when his children came into the room? There\u2019s no way any viral video could be better than that, right?\u000a\u000aWrong, Say hello to Tadhg and Derry Fleming. The Irish father and son have become an internet sensation in the last day because of their comic inability to get a bat out of their kitchen.\u000a\u000aThe clip has gone viral in the last day, with over 1.3 million views on Facebook. It\u2019s also been retweeted over 100,000 times.\u000a\u000aBut what exactly makes this video so funny, and primed for virality? Let\u2019s count the ways.\u000a\u000aFirst there\u2019s the oft-repeated phrase \u201cCatch him, Derry.\u201d After watching this video more times than I care to admit, those three words are burrowed in my brain. And it seems I\u2019m not alone\u2014the hashtag #catchhimderry even briefly trended on Twitter yesterday.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s Derry\u2019s childlike wonder at the fact that a bat got into his house in the first place\u2014when the video starts he keeps repeating \u201cThere\u2019s a bat, look at the bat.\u201d This initial surprise makes his failure to actually catch the bat even funnier\u2014he just keeps swapping out bigger towels until he succeeds.\u000a\u000aThat doesn\u2019t stop Tadhg from cheering his dad on, however. Arguably the funniest part of the clip is his encouragement of Derry with platitudes like \u201cYou\u2019re doing great\u201d and \u201cnearly got him that time\u201d (when Derry was nowhere close to getting him). And in classic Irish fashion, every time Derry misses, Tadhg yells \u201cFuck it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the video goes on, Tadhg gets even more motivated, telling Derry the bat\u2019s \u201cmaking a mockery out of you, boy.\u201d He also compares the animal to Conor McGregor because \u201che\u2019s got no legs left.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe can\u2019t forget the people cheering Derry on from the sidelines, starting with his wife Maureen. She lurks behind the doorway throughout the whole video, ignoring her son\u2019s pleas to \u201cget out.\u201d She may not want to help, but she can\u2019t look away from the spectacle. And Tadhg\u2019s close-up on his mother is probably the clip\u2019s scariest moment.\u000a\u000aAnd then there\u2019s the family dog. Scared by all the bat action, in the middle of the video he lifts his leg and urinates on the floor. It wouldn\u2019t be noticeable if not for Tadhg yelling \u201cThe dog\u2019s pissing!\u201d\u000a\u000aBy the end of the two-minute clip, Derry has caught the bat and released him outdoors. And (despite Tadhg\u2019s protests) the dog is sent out there with it, as punishment for his peeing.\u000a\u000aWell, the pup can take comfort in the fact that he just starred in the funniest viral video ever made. Take a bow, Tadhg and Derry\u2014BBC Dad\u2019s got nothing on you guys.

aVSen. Kirsten Gillibrand blasted U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over he announcement that President Trump will be rolling back protections for sexual assault victims on campus that were put in place by former President Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with CBS News on Thursday, DeVos said that the Trump administration was planning to overturn Obama\u2019s 2011 guidelines known as the \u201cDear College Letter\u201d in which his administration said that the requirements of Title IX pertaining to sexual harassment also cover sexual violence. DeVos said that Trump administration has \u201cbegun the process to do so,\u201d and maintained that the goal was to \u201cmove beyond that and move towards a better way.\u201d\u000a\u000aTitle IX is a federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex in schools and any other federally funded education programs and activities. Title IX applies to complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence and other forms of sexual misconduct.\u000a\u000aDuring a speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., on Thursday, DeVos said that she would continue to enforce Title IX and \u201cvigorously address all instances where people fall short.\u201d But she said that the Obama administration\u2019s approach is not working.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. That\u2019s why we must do better, because the current approach isn\u2019t working.\u201d\u000a\u000aGillibrand said that DeVos\u2019 announcement \u201cbetrays our students, plain and simple.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith so many sexual assaults still happening on college campuses all over the country, we should be doing everything we can to make our Title IX enforcement policies stronger \u2013 not weakening or jeopardizing them,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Department of Education has a responsibility to keep our students safe and to guarantee fairness to both sexual assault survivors and those accused of sexual assault crimes.\u201d\u000a\u000aGillibrand and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) previously called on DeVos to reverse a decision from her department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to change the way it investigates complaints. They argued that it would hamper investigations into sexual assault on college campuses.\u000a\u000aShe accused DeVos of not being committed to protecting the rights of survivors.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want to see an innocent person punished any more than I want to see a guilty person let off the hook, but Secretary DeVos has shown that she does not take the rights of survivors seriously,\u201d she continued. \u201cI will do everything in my power as a Senator to fight to support our sexual assault survivors, and I urge everyone who cares about safety and fairness on our college campuses to raise your voices with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aGov. Andrew Cuomo shared a video on his Twitter account in which he outlined the impact of DeVos\u2019 previous decision to change the way the department probes complaints as well as the decision to scrap the Obama-era guidelines. He also noted the work New York has done to protect victims of sexual assault.\u000a\u000aBetsy DeVos' proposal is about to make campuses less safe. New York stands with survivors. pic.twitter.com/ncFotPMEcm \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aPublic Advocate Letitia James echoed similar sentiments.\u000a\u000a\u201cBetsy DeVos\u2019 actions today demonstrate an appalling lack of understanding about the realities of college sexual assault and send a message to the one-in-five women who has experienced sexual assault while at college that they do not matter,\u201d James said in a statement. \u201cJust as colleges are finally providing adequate services and appropriate procedures to respond to these incidents, DeVos\u2019 actions reverse course to the bad-old-days when survivors were rightfully afraid to come forward and aggressors got away with impunity.\u201d

aVHurricane Irma is poised to hit Florida this weekend after destroying several Caribbean islands. Many residents are evacuating the state, and those choosing to stay behind are battening down the hatches.\u000a\u000aBut many local journalists are actually preparing to enter the eye of the storm and chronicle Irma\u2019s toll for their readers. So how can these intrepid reporters stay safe and smart while covering a natural disaster?\u000a\u000aEnter Martin Merzer. A writer at the Miami Herald for 29 years, Merzer developed a handy checklist for any reporter who has to cover a hurricane. While Merzer left the Herald in 2008, his memo has resurfaced and gone viral in recent days as Florida prepares for Irma.\u000a\u000aMerzer\u2019s list was written before the 24-hour news cycle existed, but many of his tips show a keen awareness of the power of online reporting.\u000a\u000a\u201cGo early. Nag your supervisor until he or she sends you early. Early is good\u2014you get a feel for the scene and you make friends before the other reporters ruin everything. Also, online needs fodder early, late, always.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cContinuous news, that\u2019s us. Remember that online is pumping nearly 24/7 and a lot of people are watching us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTake control of the online version of the story. It will keep you in the news flow and serve as the backbone of your newspaper story.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDetail, detail, detail. What is that homeowner wearing as she nails the plywood to her window? How much sweat is pouring off her? Use you eyes to harvest what people are writing on plywood shutters, verbatim. Use your ears to describe the gales. Use your nose to describe the ocean spray before and the mess afterward.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther pointers serve as a general survival guide for anyone, journalist or otherwise, in a hurricane zone.\u000a\u000a\u201cCarry cash, a lot of it. When electricity fails, credit cards become nothing much more than toothpicks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t get dehydrated. Drink lots of water. This would be a really bad time for a kidney stone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat last point is especially important, because as Merzer reminds his staff multiple times the paper can\u2019t be held liable for reporters\u2019 stupidity.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t take unnecessary chances. Don\u2019t get hurt. Rewrite gets real annoyed when your screams of pain and other ambient noise from the emergency room inhibit transcription of your dictated notes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t stand in standing water. Let the other idiots get electrocuted \u2014 we don\u2019t need them anyway. You, we can\u2019t replace because we\u2019re in a hiring freeze. Also, if you die, we need to fill out a lot of messy paperwork.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t stand outside or drive around during the storm. What\u2019s the point? Most of you aren\u2019t filming anything, and you could get killed and, you know, that hiring freeze again.\u201d\u000a\u000aStay safe, Florida reporters. And thanks for all you do.

aVIf Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2018s fashion line doesn\u2019t work out, perhaps the two should consider focusing entirely on real estate.\u000a\u000aWhile they\u2019ve received quite a bit of criticism for Kendall + Kylie (they recently pulled a \u201cvintage\u201d t-shirt collection, following serious controversy), the Jenner sisters both scored profits on Los Angeles homes in the past few weeks.\u000a\u000aKylie has amassed a whole collection of properties, primarily located in Calabasas, and she sold two this summer. First, the cosmetics mogul sold her two-story home equipped with a \u201cglam room\u201d for $3.15 million in July this year. Now, she\u2019s also sold a 5,150-square-foot single-story Hidden Hills property, which she bought just over a year ago. She paid $4.5 million for it in June 2016, before listing it for $5.4 million almost exactly a year later. She sold it for just a touch under that, at $5.28 million.\u000a\u000aNot to be outdone, Kendall has sold her own home, located in the less Kardashian-filled enclave of Hollywood Hills.\u000a\u000aThe model and reality star purchased the 4,800-square-foot house from Emily Blunt and John Krasinski for $6.5 million a bit over a year ago, but it seems the home was simply never meant to be\u2014Jenner had to deal with both a burglary and a stalking incident during her brief time at the six-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom West Hollywood home, and subsequently began quietly shopping it around as an off-market listing earlier this summer.\u000a\u000aDespite her relatively short time residing there, she still made a decent profit\u2014it sold for $6.85 million.\u000a\u000aAlas, the older Jenner sister still has one more home to go\u2014it appears she hasn\u2019t yet sold her \u201cstarter\u201d apartment. The model bought the two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom Westwood condo for $1.39 million in 2014, before deciding she wanted to upgrade to a larger space. She listed the apartment for $1.6 million in June, but hasn\u2019t yet found an interested party. In fact, just this week she discounted it a tad\u2014it\u2019s now up for grabs for $1.53 million.

aVCheech and Chong shouldn\u2019t celebrate just yet. Contrary to previous findings, a new study shows that marijuana use may not be damaging to young kidneys. Nonetheless, the drug has been associated with reduced I.Q. in habitual teen users and with psychotic disorders, and some experts warn that tokers inhale a cocktail of dangerous chemicals.\u000a\u000aThe latest study was published August 24 in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. As WebMD reports, \u201cStudies with animals had suggested regular pot use could alter kidney function. But the authors of the new study found no evidence to support that claim, at least among healthy young adults who were followed for up to 15 years.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut this doesn\u2019t mean you can break out the bong sans consequence. WebMD continues, \u201c\u2018Results from our observational study in young adults with normal kidney function may not translate into a clinically meaningful difference and may be insufficient to inform decision-making concerning marijuana use,\u2019 said Dr. Julie Ishida, who worked on the study. She\u2019s with the University of California, San Francisco, and San Francisco VA Medical Center.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhatever the truth here, it\u2019s not the kidneys pot users need worry about most. Consider a definitive study into cannabis use\u2019s long-term effects that \u201chas demolished the argument that the drug is safe,\u201d as the Daily Mail reported in 2014. Citing the study\u2014a 20-year review conducted by Dr. Wayne Hall, a professor of addiction policy at King\u2019s College London and drug advisor for the World Health Organization\u2014the paper reports:\u000a\u000aOne in six teenagers who regularly smoke the drug become dependent on it.\u000a\u000aCannabis doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia.\u000a\u000aCannabis users do worse at school, and heavy use in adolescence appears to impair intellectual development.\u000a\u000aOne in 10 adults who regularly smoke the drug become dependent on it, and those who use it are more likely to go on to use harder drugs.\u000a\u000aDriving after smoking cannabis doubles the risk of a car crash, a risk that increases substantially if the driver has also had a drink.\u000a\u000aSmoking it while pregnant reduces the baby\u2019s birth weight.\u000a\u000aOther studies have also suggested that while pot is now hot, it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a mere Millennial Martini. For instance, a study by a group of international university researchers published in 2016 found \u201cpast exposure to marijuana use to be significantly associated with worse verbal memory in middle age.\u201d In this vein, Forbes\u2019 Travis Bradberry asserted in 2015 that the stereotype of pot smokers as \u201cdimwitted and slow\u201d is accurate, citing a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. showing that heavy adolescent marijuana use permanently lowers I.Q.\u2014by an average of eight points. That\u2019s more than one-half a standard deviation.\u000a\u000aAnother harsh cannabis critic is Dr. Michael Savage who, aside from being an award-winning radio host, is a trained epidemiologist and has authored close to 20 books on health and nutrition. Stating in a 2010 radio segment that \u201cmarijuana is far more dangerous than tobacco,\u201d he went on to explain, \u201cMainstream marijuana has ammonia levels that are up to 20-fold greater than that found in tobacco. Hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxide, and some aromatic amines, which are all carcinogenic, were found in marijuana smoke at concentrations three to five times those found in tobacco smoke.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the segment\u2019s end, Savage named approximately two dozen chemicals found in cannabis smoke and warned that much of today\u2019s marijuana can contain mercury because it may be grown in mercury-rich volcanic soil. This could possibly lead to the mercury-induced dementia known as \u201cmad-hatter\u2019s syndrome,\u201d thus named because hatters of bygone days were heavily exposed to the metal, using it to stiffen their felt hats\u2019 fibers.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, pot still has its defenders. For example, Barack Obama, who admitted to heavy adolescent use and who was a member of a high-school cannabis coterie called \u201cthe Choom Gang,\u201d told The New Yorker in 2014 that he doesn\u2019t think marijuana \u201cis more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d This equating of pot with booze\u2014to justify the former\u2019s legalization\u2014is common, but misses a simple point.\u000a\u000aDrunkenness is frowned upon and social drinking is recognized to be one or two adult beverages.\u000a\u000aBut marijuana smokers don\u2019t take just one or two puffs. \u201cDrunkenness\u201d\u2014the altering of one\u2019s mental state\u2014is the goal every time they light up. Given this, is pot use ever really \u201ccasual\u201d?\u000a\u000aPerhaps this is one reason why Mark Winstanley of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, speaking of the link between cannabis use and psychosis and schizophrenia, warned that smoking the drug amounts to playing \u201cRussian roulette with your mental health.\u201d

aV\u201cShould I give the benediction?\u201d gallerist Roland Augustine asked the nine of us who had gathered on Saturday morning, Nov. 12, outside Luhring Augustine, the Chelsea gallery he runs with Lawrence Luhring. He laughed. \u201cOn your mark. Get set. Go!\u201d We bounded east on 23rd Street, carrying a thin bouquet of chamomile flowers in our hands, high-fiving Mr. Luhring down the block, and then, following Dutch artist Guido van der Werve, turned left on Sixth Avenue, toward Central Park.\u000a\u000aMr. van der Werve, 34, outfitted in a black shirt, shorts and knee-high compression socks, was leading us to the grave of Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, in Valhalla, New York, a 30-mile trek, for his Performa 11 work. (Chamomiles are Russia\u2019s native flower.) The last time we ran more than 10 miles was about a year ago, and as we ran we realized that trying to participate was a very poor decision.\u000a\u000aAfter winding through Central Park, finishing six miles, most of the runners had given up and Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson (also a Luhring Augustine artist), who had made part of the journey on a trusty folding bicycle, decided to quit. We were beginning to feel rather fatigued. Mr. van der Werve, however, felt great. A few months earlier he had run 60 miles around his house (for an art piece), and he had made a 28-mile version of the run to the grave last year, leaving from MoMA P.S.1 as part of his participation in that museum\u2019s \u201cGreater New York\u201d exhibition.\u000a\u000aAlong with the artist and another writer, Reid Singer (who had run the New York City Marathon the previous weekend, and is thus completely, charmingly insane), we wound our way up through Harlem and the Bronx and Mount Vernon. We entered Yonkers, and passed Sarah Lawrence College. \u201cIf you keep up this pace, you will run a four-hour marathon,\u201d Mr. van der Werve told us encouragingly.\u000a\u000aThen, at mile 20, our knee felt like it was about to pop off. It was unpleasant. So we stopped, and followed the rest of the run in an SUV that Luhring Augustine had rented. Mr. van der Werve looked entirely relaxed as he cruised along with Mr. Singer, and they picked up the pace a bit after graciously running at a somewhat reduced speed to accommodate your author.\u000a\u000aA few days earlier, at the Trestle on Tenth restaurant in Chelsea, we had asked Mr. van der Werve how the inaugural Rachmaninoff run came about for the P.S.1 exhibition. \u201cThe other idea was climbing the height of Mount Everest on a step ladder,\u201d he explained. \u201cI tried it for about three hours, just to test it, but that turned out to be impossible, at least for me.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. van der Werve, who has composed music for many of his films, said that he had once read that when Rachmaninoff died in 1943, World War II prevented his body from being returned to Europe, and so he ended up being buried in Westchester. \u201cHe seemed kind of lonely there,\u201d he proposed. \u201cNo one knows he is there. Chopin is in Pre Lachaise, with Jim Morrison and other famous people.\u201d (For a future project, he is planning a 1,000-mile triathlon between Paris to Warsaw, where Chopin\u2019s heart is buried supposedly buried, having been secreted out of France by his sister.)\u000a\u000aWe asked him why he likes to run, admitting that we tend to picture artists smoking and drinking. He explained, \u201cI\u2019ve done that a lot, as well, but I tend to get hooked on things, and I figured it was better to get hooked on a running addiction than anything else. For any artist, or anyone who has to structure their own time, it\u2019s very easy to turn around a point for a long time, so to say,\u201d he continued, between sips of espresso.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of what I do is trying to come up with new ideas for films or music, so it can be hard. Running is a great way to get sharp,\u201d he told us. In Berlin, he has started \u201ca little running club. The Berlin Artist Running Foundation, or BARF. We have about 20 members, but it\u2019s hard to organize artists. What I do is, when I am going to run\u201d\u2014he runs five or six days a week\u2014\u201cI post it on a Facebook page. Sometimes people show up. Usually no one shows up.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cMany times, when you know you\u2019re going to have a bad day, it\u2019s nice to go for a run.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is hard to imagine Mr. van der Werve having a bad day. Relaxed and cheerful, he jumped from one story and anecdote to another during our talk (and during the run)\u2014telling us the source of the brand name Asics, the history of freestyle swimming and how much he liked The Book of Mormon when he saw it with colleagues from the gallery earlier in the week. But there is a sadness\u2014a Romantic melancholy\u2014in much of his work.\u000a\u000aOne film shows a man\u2014the artist\u2014walking alone on a wide expanse of ice, just yards away from a huge ice-clearing ship that is bearing down beside him. In another, he acquires a Steinway grand piano and performs Chopin\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 (he once trained to be a classic pianist) cramped inside his Amsterdam apartment with a sizable orchestra. The piano is then repossessed by the company.\u000a\u000aMore than five and a half hours after we began, we met Messrs. van der Werve and Singer in Kensico Cemetery. (It had taken a bit longer than expected, the artist explained alter, because the route\u2013judging by his GPS watch\u2013had ended up being 33 miles, not the expected 30.) Each laid his flowers on the grave, concluding one of the more bizarre, elegantly simple pieces of durational performances we have ever seen. We had been invited along on the journey, an equal with the artist, but failed. No need to worry, he explained, the run will be an annual tradition\u000a\u000aBack in the SUV, returning to Manhattan, we asked Mr. van der Werve how he expected to feel the next day. \u201cWe all may be a bit immobile,\u201d he said. He let out a laugh. \u201cStairs may be a problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aarusseth@observer.com

aVNetflix has its original scripted dramas and comedies, its steadily improving stable of original films, and now it wants to get in on the reality competition front. But instead of trotting out the stale American Idol formula, the streaming service is turning to John Legend for something fresher.\u000a\u000aVariety reports that Netflix is developing the unscripted Hip-Hop reality competition series Rhythm & Flow from producer Legend and his Get Lifted Film co. along with former NBC executive Jeff Gaspin and Primary Wave Entertainment. Netflix has yet to order the project to series and there isn\u2019t any talent associated with the show as of yet. It also remains to be seen if Legend would appear on-camera in some form. Fingers crossed that he\u2019s the lead judge. We could totally see him being the Adam Levine of Rhythm & Flow.\u000a\u000aWhile Netflix has cultivated hits from the unscripted formula in Making a Murderer, The Keepers and Chelsea, the streaming service has yet to really connect with reality TV. Last year\u2019s athletic contest Ultimate Beastmaster arrived to the shrugged shoulders of most subscribers. Rhythm & Flow would marks Netflix\u2019s first true blue talent series.\u000a\u000aReality talent competitions are routinely major components of a broadcast network\u2019s power lineup. ABC trumped Fox in a bidding war for the American Idol revival in May, Fox then began developing a singing competition The Four last month. NBC will debut The Stream in the near future which would pair with The Voice for a year-round schedule. Ratings is the name of the game in broadcast and reality talent competitions bring in eyeballs. That\u2019s why Katy Perry is getting $25 million from ABC for Idol and why NBC is shelling out low-six-figures for Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson on The Voice, per Variety.\u000a\u000a\u201cRhythm & Flow, with its focus on soul and R&B, would be a more targeted play than the broadcast shows. Netflix is approaching a finished deal for the show just weeks after Legend and Get Lifted signed a new first-look deal at Sony Pictures Television. The two companies had previously partnered to on the WGN America scripted series Underground,\u201d the outlet reports.

aVYou know leaky gut syndrome as the catchphrase of wellness influencers and your paleo-eating friends. They use the term to explain everything from digestive distress to skin rashes and migraines. But the truth is that leaky gut\u2014clinically known as \u201cincreased intestinal permeability\u201d\u2014is a serious condition with serious consequences.\u000a\u000aWhen your small intestine is healthy, it is semi-permeable, thus allowing critical vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat to be absorbed and circulated around the body via the bloodstream. However, when your gut is \u201cleaky,\u201d the pores of the intestine widen (like getting a larger hole torn in your net) and become too permeable. And as the \u201cnetting\u201d in your digestive tract remains damaged, toxins, bad bacteria, and undigested food particles pass into your bloodstream. Because of this, a leaky gut can lead to health problems including inflammatory skin issues, fatigue, joint pain, malabsorption of nutrients, food sensitivities (especially to dairy and gluten), autoimmune diseases, thyroid problems and more.\u000a\u000aMillions of people struggle with a leaky gut and don\u2019t realize it\u2019s the underlying issue behind one or several of their health concerns. As a result, it\u2019s vital to heal the gut in order to have optimal health. The problem is that traditional doctors are not trained to treat this condition, and with so many supplements on the market, it\u2019s difficult for individuals to know which products to turn to.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve compiled a list of the top three supplements that support gut healing. Start with these, and you\u2019ll see results and save money at the same time.\u000a\u000aBone Broth\u000a\u000aWhen you have a leaky gut, you need to remove any foods or factors that are damaging your gut, including highly processed foods, inflammatory foods such as gluten and dairy, and any foods that you have an allergy or sensitivity to. You need to incorporate healing foods instead.\u000a\u000aBone broth is one of the most healing foods on earth, and I have found it to be the most important thing to supplement your diet with if you\u2019re struggling with a leaky gut. Nutrient-dense bone broth contains amino acids like glycine and proline, as well as collagen, which all help to heal the cellular damage of an inflamed and leaky gut. Bone broth is also one of the top anti-inflammatory foods, and when you\u2019re trying to heal your gut, you want to focus on calming inflammation. Making homemade bone broth is great, but if you don\u2019t have the time, you can add bone broth protein powder to a smoothie, soup or water.\u000a\u000aProbiotics\u000a\u000aAny good leaky gut treatment plan includes supplements that support digestion and protect the gut lining from further damage. Probiotic supplements do both and, after bone broth, are the next best thing to add to a healing diet to repair a leaky gut.\u000a\u000aWhy are probiotics so helpful? Probiotics help re-colonize the gut with good bacteria. Probiotics also balance the stomach\u2019s pH and create enzymes that destroy harmful bacteria. (Candida symptoms are a perfect example of what can happen when bad bacteria has taken control.) A leaky gut is often caused by an imbalance of good bacteria and bad bacteria, so making sure you are getting enough probiotics on a regular basis is key to healing your gut.\u000a\u000aI recommend consuming probiotic-rich foods and taking at least 50 billion units of a high-quality probiotic supplement each day.\u000a\u000aDigestive Enzymes\u000a\u000aWhen you have a leaky gut, undigested food particles can get into your bloodstream, leading to unwanted symptoms, such as food allergies and malabsorption of key nutrients like vitamin B12 and magnesium. Conversely, digestive enzymes help your body break down food properly and fully. This, in turn, lessens the likelihood that partially digested food particles cause further damage to your gut wall. I recommend taking one or two capsules of digestive enzymes at the start of each meal for optimal results.\u000a\u000aDr. Josh Axe, DNM, DC, CNS, is a doctor of natural medicine, clinical nutritionist and author with a passion to help people get well using food as medicine.

aVGraydon Carter, the dean of New York magazine editors, announced today that he is leaving his post at Vanity Fair in December after a 25-year run.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to leave while the magazine is on top,\u201d Carter told The New York Times.\u000a\u000aCarter, a native of Toronto, joined the Cond Nast publication in 1992 after stints at Time and The New York Observer. He also founded the satirical magazine Spy, which famously called President Donald Trump a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring his time at Vanity Fair, the magazine became well-known for mixing celebrity news and political exclusives. Notable stories included the first public interview with Watergate leaker \u201cDeep Throat\u201d (W. Mark Felt) and Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s first interview and photo shoot following gender confirmation surgery.\u000a\u000aCarter nurtured a stable of writers including Christopher Hitchens, Dominick Dunne, Fran Lebowitz and James Wolcott. And he turned the annual Vanity Fair Oscar party into the hottest ticket of awards season.\u000a\u000aThe magazine\u2019s circulation also grew to 1.2 million people and web traffic spiked as well. But at the same time, print advertising eroded and Vanity Fair was forced to cut staff.\u000a\u000aCarter was coy about future plans, saying only that he has the \u201crough architecture\u201d of a future project in mind. In recent years, he\u2019s branched into restaurant ownership and Broadway producing.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no word yet about who will replace Carter as editor, although Adam Moss of New York magazine and Janice Min of The Hollywood Reporter are rumored contenders.

aVNew Yorkers have always known their city is the center of the universe, so it seems only fair that New York ought to play such an unusually outsized role in this year\u2019s presidential race.\u000a\u000aSure, the city has always funded presidential campaigns and has always seen the candidates visit if only to meet with rich people from whom they would like money. But the state has rarely weighed in formally on the race with a presidential primary that was actually competitive\u2014and never has it had competitive primaries in both parties at the same time. Now, instead of meeting only with the monied class, the candidates are eating pasta in the Bronx and matzo in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aIf having the candidates campaign in New York City, with all its ethnic food and tabloid drama, wasn\u2019t enough, two of the candidates most likely to become the next president are New York residents.\u000a\u000aWith the star power of the presidential campaign in town, it seems even the city\u2019s biggest personalities\u2014its gangly mayor, its mercurial governor, its swaggering prosecutor and grinning police commissioner\u2014have taken a backseat to the action. The campaign is all anyone is talking about, including Mayor Bill de Blasio himself, who has been pining to be a go-to progressive pundit and favored surrogate of Hillary Clinton, with less-than-stellar results.\u000a\u000a(Indeed, Mr. de Blasio has been lucky that all eyes are on the primary: It has meant less attention is being paid to reported investigations of his campaign contributions and his administration\u2019s role in a controversial property sale.)\u000a\u000aThe 2016 race seems to swirl around nearly everyone, as New York Democrats jockey for favor with their old pal Ms. Clinton\u2014perhaps looking for appointments down the line\u2014and jockey for headlines bashing their hometown foe, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s power list has a decided focus, then, on the national figures who call New York City home, the local folks who help keep them in the running and the possibilities the future holds for those people\u2014and what it could all mean for everybody else in town.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Schumer, Senator\u000a\u000aMr. Schumer has been ravenously ambitious since his days as a pothole-filling assemblyman from Brooklyn. Now, as the anointed next leader of the Senate Democrats, with the Democratic Party facing favorable prospects in November, there\u2019s an excellent chance you\u2019ll be calling him Majority Leader Schumer in 2017.\u000a\u000aNew York has never had a majority leader, let alone one from the borough of Kings, and Mr. Schumer will cement his role as the Empire State\u2019s most important elected official. Our city has long struggled on the federal terrain\u2014urban issues just aren\u2019t sexy to Republican congressmen from the Ozarks\u2014but with Mr. Schumer as one of the most powerful elected officials in the country, we\u2019re bound to do a little bit better. No matter who becomes the president\u2014more on that later\u2014Mr. Schumer is one New Yorker who is assured a spot near the top of the heap in Washington.\u000a\u000aHe also arrives at a precarious time for his own party, even as Democrats gloat about the crackup of the GOP in the Year of Trump. The grassroots left, powering Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, is ascendant, and the centrist Schumer has never had a very comfortable relationship with the most liberal end of the Democratic Party. His defense of Wall Street and his ability to raise prodigious sums of money from the financial sector were once nothing but an asset. Mr. Schumer\u2019s rise to power came in part because he could raise cash as well as anyone in politics. Now, with angry progressives demanding purity from their Democrats, Mr. Schumer will have to figure out how to balance his own pragmatist instincts with a political environment that may be unfriendly to people like him. Does Mr. Schumer tack left? Or for the first time in his career, does he resist the political current?\u000a\u000a2. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State\u000a\u000aNot since Thomas Dewey challenged Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 have two New Yorkers\u2014one a mid-life arrival, the other native-born\u2014vied against each other for the White House. And while Ms. Clinton\u2019s democratic socialist primary opponent, Mr. Sanders (a son of Brooklyn himself), may have a few rounds left in him, her nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate is all but assured, assuming nothing comes of her email scandal. Voters remain lukewarm to the ex-secretary of state, but New York\u2019s political elite has scrambled to hoist the former Empire State senator onto their shoulders. The names of her top surrogates in the city dot this list, and some could easily wind up in her administration should she triumph in November. A polarizing figure, Ms. Clinton could have the good fortune of facing an opponent this fall whose unfavorability ratings outstrip even her own.\u000a\u000aAbout that opponent. Mr. Trump, too, is a New Yorker who could be the next president. But truth be told, his influence in this town seems largely relegated to being the target of ire from Democrats, who see a win-win in criticizing a candidate so deeply disliked by so many, even as he is beloved by those who show up to his rallies and to vote for him. It\u2019s unclear yet whether Mr. Trump has shattered the Republican Party or revitalized it, or whether his campaign will be little more than a passing spasm of anti-establishment outrage\u2014and as such, the extent of his true power as a player in New York City remains unclear, too.\u000a\u000aThis list will go to press just hour before some of these open questions will be answered in our state\u2019s primary. If Mr. Trump cracks 50 percent in his hometown, it\u2019ll boost him toward the convention and argue he can be competitive in the northerast in the general. An under-convincing win here will be rough for Ms. Clinton, but if she can win by 10 or more points she\u2019ll keep surging toward November.\u000a\u000a3. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney\u000a\u000aAll pols fear the probing, sardonic eye of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District. After falling heavily last year on the two most powerful legislators in the state, ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and former State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, it seemed to pass over Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2014though the prosecutor is still reportedly peering into potential sweetheart contracts for donors in Buffalo.\u000a\u000aNow Mayor Bill de Blasio and his NYPD are in the anticorruption evangelist\u2019s sights. At issue are likely illegal gifts cops seem to have received from two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top contributors in Brooklyn\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community. The investigation may also implicate one or more of the much-criticized nonprofits the mayor created to raise cash and advance his liberal agenda, which the group Citizens Union labeled a \u201cshadow government\u201d earlier this year.\u000a\u000aGiven his success exposing shady dealings in Albany, City Hall and on Wall Street, Mr. Bharara (a former aide to Mr. Schumer) could well become the attorney general for the United States under a Clinton administration\u2014or, given that Ms. Clinton set up her controversial \u201chomebrew\u201d email server on his turf, he could wind up leading the investigation that denies her the White House.\u000a\u000a4. Andrew Cuomo, Governor\u000a\u000aJust in time for the presidential season, the famously cautious and calculating governor banked left\u2014hard. He forewent his own rumored bid for the White House to instead become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s earliest endorsers and biggest boosters in New York. He also embraced two of the causes he once scoffed at: a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. Both passed in this year\u2019s budget, giving New York some of the most liberal labor laws in the country.\u000a\u000aThe governor has also abandoned his once-proud fiscal conservatism, announcing billions upon billions of dollars worth in infrastructure investments. Every decrepit and despised New York transit hub would get demolished then built anew under the governor\u2019s designs: LaGuardia Airport, Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Nobody seems to know yet where all the money will come from, but sources tell the Observer Mr. Cuomo sees these projects as his legacy in office.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Cuomo is auditioning for some role in Ms. Clinton\u2019s Cabinet (or what that role would be\u2014they\u2019re based in the same state, so vice president is pretty much off the table) or whether he just decided to spite his rival, Mr. de Blasio, by snatching away the mantle of progressivism. Either way, New York City will be a very different place by the time he departs Albany.\u000a\u000a5. Bill de Blasio, Mayor\u000a\u000aFor all his bumbling, fumbling, stumbling, bobbling, unforced errors and outright pratfalls, Mr. de Blasio managed this spring to push through what may be his most significant accomplishment in office: rezoning New York City. From now on, developers will get the benefit of loosened height and density restrictions, but they\u2019ll have to set aside 25 to 30 percent of new apartments for middle-class and lower-middle class tenants.\u000a\u000aThe mayor is still missing a new version of the 421a building tax credit\u2014the gas for his affordable housing engine\u2014but the rule changes have potential to permanently change both the city\u2019s rental market and its physical terrain. That will doubtless outlast Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure at Gracie Mansion, however long that ends up being.\u000a\u000aAfter a few flirtations with his ideological cousin Mr. Sanders, Mr. de Blasio belatedly backed Ms. Clinton, his former employer, for president. His hesitance seemed to earn him her ire, but the mayor paid his penance knocking on doors for her in Iowa, and she appears to have warmed to him again. His grandiose hopes to hold a candidate forum and shape the 2016 race have fallen through, and he seems to have accepted a humbler role in the process, shilling for her in New York, the same as nearly every other Democrat in the city.\u000a\u000aHe just better hope that Mr. Bharara\u2019s investigation goes away.\u000a\u000a6. Bill Bratton, Police Commissioner\u000a\u000aThe media-savvy police commissioner about town was at the top of this last year and with good reason: Mr. Bratton is many ways a better politician than the mayor who hired him. He is still the commissioner who seems to get the most leeway from the mayor he serves. But while Mr. Bratton dominated city headlines last year\u2014going against the mayor to call for more cops in the\u000a\u000abudget, dealing with the fallout of massive antipolice protests\u2014things are simply a bit quieter this year, as City Hall moved to focus on housing more than the issues aligned with the NYPD. And Mr. Bharara\u2019s probe into higher-ups at the NYPD accepting gifts is sure to be a headache\u2014though the mayor is doubtless glad he chose Mr. Bratton to lead the department over one of the men being investigated, former Chief of Department Philip Banks. Mr. Bratton continues to say what\u2019s on his mind, even jumping into the presidential race to take Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to task\u2014and tell him to \u201cshut up\u201d\u2014in response to his proposal to monitor Muslims to prevent terror attacks. Any police commissioner is a major presence in New York but particularly this one, with his penchant for hitting the best restaurants and the biggest social events, filling a role that the homebody mayor doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy much.\u000a\u000a7. Carl Heastie, Assembly Speaker\u000a\u000aHis first year as Assembly speaker, Mr. Heastie gained a reputation for the same detached taciturnity as his predecessor Mr. Silver. This spring, he showed for the first time that he might have some of the fallen pol\u2019s famed negotiating prowess. The Bronx lawmaker shielded the city from up to a billion dollars in cuts to the CUNY system and in Medicaid assistance from Albany that Mr. Cuomo had proposed in his budget. He also laid out a plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, to the governor\u2019s chagrin, indicating that Mr. Heastie is looking to put pressure on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s left flank.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nearly impossible to decipher the speaker\u2019s motivations, but he\u2019s the closest thing Mr. de Blasio has to a powerful friend in Albany\u2014even though he\u2019s much closer to the mayor\u2019s main rival at home, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.\u000a\u000a8. Melissa Mark-Viverito, Council Speaker\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the City Council as mainly a rubber stamp for the mayor\u2014but even if it is, its speaker is looking to make the most of her position. Ms. Mark-Viverito has tried to assert her\u000a\u000aindependence from Mr. de Blasio: making amendments to his housing plan, throwing cold water all over his crumbling effort to ban horse carriages (but only after first carrying the water for it), breaking from him on the efforts to cap Uber in the city. But she\u2019s also used her perch to be a voice on national issues, speaking out frequently on immigration and representation of Latinos in local government and becoming a favored surrogate for Hillary Clinton. In fact, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s political prowess was perhaps best on display with her endorsement of Ms. Clinton\u2014particularly considering how Mr. de Blasio bungled his. Plenty of people are whispering about whether the speaker might be offered a spot in a future Clinton administration when her term in the Council expires.\u000a\u000a9. Anthony Shorris, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aThe unsung bureaucrat who makes City Hall go around, Mr. Shorris is the man who does the day-to-day managing of the city as its first deputy mayor. He took a leading role in reassessing the city\u2019s services for the homeless after one of his fellow deputy mayors hastily left the department and the leader of the Department of Homeless Services was seemingly pushed out. His institutional knowledge of government has been key for Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a10. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO\u000a\u000aThe Goldman Sachs CEO has come a long way from the Brooklyn housing projects he grew up in\u2014financially at least. A search of Ms. Clinton\u2019s donor rolls comes up flush with his employees, providing fodder for both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. (That goes without mentioning all those speeches Goldman paid the former first lady to deliver.) He also counts Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife among his underlings, and he enjoys a fairly warm relationship with Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a11. Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator\u000a\u000aFor now, Gillibrand will be in Schumer\u2019s shadow, but New York\u2019s junior senator has been building her profile as an advocate for women and the sexually abused. Long-removed from her days as a conservative upstate lawmaker viewed skeptically by the city\u2019s Democratic establishment, she just may be future presidential candidate material.\u000a\u000a12. Steven Banks, Commissioner of Social Services\u000a\u000aMr. Banks has emerged in the last year as a major player in the mayor\u2019s administration, rising up a somewhat obscure post at the Human Resources Administration to become the face of the city\u2019s response to a growing and difficult to manage homelessness problem\u2014and its brand-new Commissioner of Social Services. Mr. Banks, who made his bones at the Legal Aid Society suing the departments he now leads, will now oversee both the HRA and the Department of Homeless Services. Even-handed and hyper-knowledgeable about his field, Mr. Banks clearly has the trust of Mr. de Blasio, who has let Mr. Banks lead several of his own City Hall press conferences.\u000a\u000a13. James Capalino, CEO of Capalino + Company\u000a\u000aThis veteran lobbyist\u2019s fortunes have steadily risen since City Hall was taken over by Mr. de Blasio\u2014making his lobbying firm the highest-earning in the city. That\u2019s raised some eyebrows, considering Mr. Capalino\u2019s close relationship with Mr. de Blasio, for whom he\u2019s raised campaign cash. That tight relationship has been attractive to clients of Mr. Capalino\u2019s, particularly the real estate powerhouses like Brookfield Properties and SL Green that employ him. But what\u2019s really put Mr. Capalino in the spotlight, and under the microscope, is his connection to a deal that has proven disastrous for the mayor: the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side property that will allow a private developer to turn what was once an nursing home for AIDS patients into luxury condos\u2014and which helped the building\u2019s owner make a $72 million profit selling it.\u000a\u000a14. Hakeem Jeffries, Congressman\u000a\u000aPossibly Brooklyn\u2019s brightest rising star, the congressman has become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s top lieutenants in the black community. A relatively new member of the New York delegation and a Democrat in the Republican House, Mr. Jeffries has long reportedly eyed other pols\u2019 jobs\u2014including Mr. de Blasio\u2019s and Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s. Perhaps a job in the White House would be a suitable outlet for his ambitions.\u000a\u000a15. Vicki Been and Carl Weisbrod, Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner and Planning Chairman\u000a\u000aThe dynamic duo at the forefront of the mayor\u2019s plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in a decade, Ms. Been and Mr. Weisbrod played major roles in cajoling the planning commission and city council to pass the mayor\u2019s massive rezoning plan. But even after that victory, there\u2019s still plenty to be done in terms of neighborhood-specific efforts, like the combative one underway in East New York.\u000a\u000a16. Thomas Prendergast, MTA Chairman\u000a\u000aMr. Prendergast not only runs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2014and therefore oversees a vital part of nearly every New Yorker\u2019s day\u2014he also serves as a major New York City surrogate for Gov. Cuomo. Often, that means going toe-to-toe with the mayor, arguing over things like the city\u2019s share of the bill for the MTA.\u000a\u000a17. Michael Bloomberg, Former Mayor\u000a\u000aMr. Bloomberg couldn\u2019t stay away from politics forever. When it looked like the nation might face a Sanders/Trump race for the presidency, the billionaire media mogul publicly weighed injecting another New Yorker into the mix\u2014himself. He ultimately realized an independent doesn\u2019t have a prayer in America\u2019s two-party system, but he bitterly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive and demagogic\u201d style upon withdrawing from contention. Look for him to endorse Ms. Clinton after the convention, possibly with his wallet.\u000a\u000a18. Emma Wolfe, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs\u000a\u000aA veteran member of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inner circle, Ms. Wolfe is the mayor\u2019s political fixer and his liaison to the groups outside City Hall with which he must work\u2014the governor\u2019s office, unions, the City Council and just about everyone in Albany. Behind her aw-shucks demeanor is a tough and experienced political operative and one of the mayor\u2019s closest and sharpest advisers.\u000a\u000a19. Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation\u000a\u000aDismiss Mr. Murdoch\u2019s New York Post at your peril. The venerable tabloid is forever a pain for any mayor but especially this one\u2014who just last week saw himself on the wood (that\u2019s the cover, for those who don\u2019t know tab-speak) three days in a row, accused of scandal. For readers who like their criticism of Mr. de Blasio a little classier, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s got The Wall Street Journal\u2014which also offers influential reporting on just about everything else. And then, there\u2019s that little cable powerhouse Fox News. In a town where the media is a major force, Mr. Murdoch is the force behind plenty of it.\u000a\u000a20. Dean Fuleihan, Budget Director\u000a\u000aThe city\u2019s moneyman, Mr. Fuleihan oversees New York\u2019s mammoth budget\u2014proposed to be $82.1 billion this year. It\u2019s a less stressful job than in years past, now that the city has inked contracts with most of the municipal workforce and with a budget the mayor himself has admitted isn\u2019t exactly as exciting as his previous ones. But when it comes to budgets, as City Hall has also noted, boring can be good. Perhaps the biggest challenge is working with Albany\u2014something Mr. Fuleihan, a former aide to disgraced ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, knows plenty about.\u000a\u000a21. Alicia Glen, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most headline-grabbing challenge of Ms. Glen\u2019s deputy mayorship, shepherding through the mayor\u2019s affordable housing plan, is done now that the plan has been approved. But there will be plenty of work to do make that plan a reality\u2014particularly in the absence of the 421a tax credit that induces so many developers to build. And Ms. Glen will remain a bridge to the real estate types and private companies that play a major role in economic development in the city.\u000a\u000a22. James Malatras, Director of State Operations\u000a\u000aMr. Malatras is Gov. Cuomo\u2019s go-to-guy on policy, and lately it seems like lots of the policies that Mr. Cuomo rolls out focus on New York City. Mr. Malatras is tasked with putting out fires like the one Mr. Cuomo set when he proposed shifting nearly half a billion dollars of costs for CUNY to the city.\u000a\u000a23. George Gresham, 1199SEIU President\u000a\u000aGresham, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, is the unique figure who manages to be on good terms with both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo. As the head of the largest union in the state, he\u2019s been at the forefront of the fight for $15 push and remains maybe the most important New York labor leader out there.\u000a\u000a24. Dean Baquet, Executive Editor of The New York Times\u000a\u000aIf the screaming headlines of the Post or the woodcuts of the Journal aren\u2019t your speed, how about Mr. Baquet\u2019s Grey Lady? As the editor of the Times, Mr. Baquet determines all the news fit to print on politics ranging from City Hall to Albany to the campaign trail. Plenty of reporters have been plucked from local politics beats to chase the presidential candidates\u2014but at the same time, the paper is beefing up its presence in City Hall.\u000a\u000a25. Phil Walzak, Senior Advisor to the Mayor\u000a\u000aAfter a rocky stint as press secretary\u2014a gig that wasn\u2019t quite what he wanted in the first place\u2014Mr. Walzak has settled in as \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the mayor. He still spends a decent amount of his time crafting Mr. de Blasio\u2019s message, at least when he and the mayor aren\u2019t heading off on road trips to watch ballgames.\u000a\u000a26. Jonathan Rosen, Co-Founder ofBerlinRosen\u000a\u000aMr. Rosen, of the PR firm BerlinRosen, is perhaps Mr. de Blasio\u2019s best-known outside consultant\u2014but the mayor\u2019s relationship with Mr. Rosen and others has been gaining greater scrutiny. Mr. Rosen is not a lobbyist and as such does not have to disclose his meetings with the mayor, but his firm represents a slew of boldfaced names that have major business at City Hall. BerlinRosen also handles the mayor\u2019s nongovernmental press, putting out his message as Mr. de Blasio continually tries to influence national politics and spinning on issues like his campaign contributions.\u000a\u000a27. Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of Teachers\u000a\u000aWhile the UFT originally backed former comptroller Bill Thompson, Mr. Mulgrew came around pretty quickly to Mr. de Blasio: The union was the first to ink a new contract with City Hall, and from there Mr. Mulgrew hasn\u2019t looked back. He\u2019s been a frequent visitor to City Hall and a loud defender of the mayor. That must be a welcome change for Mr. Mulgrew after 12 years of being frozen out by Mr. Bloomberg.\u000a\u000a28. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u000a\u000aMr. Dimon is the head of one of those big banks Bernie Sanders is always talking about breaking up, so unsurprisingly he doesn\u2019t think doing so is a great idea. He remains a powerful representative of Wall Street\u2014which is something of an industry non grata in this election cycle but has long held sway over New York\u2019s elected officials, especially Mr. Schumer, to whom Mr. Dimon has donated plenty.\u000a\u000a29. Scott Stringer, Comptroller\u000a\u000aMr. Stringer was among the first city Democratic pols to start going after Mr. de Blasio, and as others have joined in, he\u2019s remained a loud voice thanks to his ability to turn out audits and run investigations. Is it all part of a lead-up to challenging Mr. de Blasio in 2017? It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Stringer is willing to take that risk, but he\u2019s clearly intending to set himself up as a critical voice and perhaps an alternative.\u000a\u000a30. Bill Lipton and Dan Cantor, Co-Founders of the Working Families Party\u000a\u000aAfter backing Mr. Cuomo in 2014 and pissing off its base, the progressive party is getting a redo by going all-in on Bernie Sanders, even as the New York Democratic establishment (and many WFP allies) unite around Ms. Clinton. Were Mr. Sanders to exceed expectations on April 19, expect plenty of accolades for the two men, who have made the labor-backed party a force in New York.\u000a\u000a31. Letitia James, Public Advocate\u000a\u000aThe public advocate has sought to bring her legal experience to the role, filing a slew of lawsuits against various city agencies. Several of them have been tossed out, but that hasn\u2019t slowed down Ms. James\u2019 brand of agitating against the city while also being careful not to do much damage to her friend, Mr. de Blasio. Ms. James has also made a habit of traveling all across the city for events like town halls\u2014a move that might help boost her numbers when she runs for re-election (or perhaps for a higher office).\u000a\u000a32. Shola Olatoye, NYCHA Chairwoman\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of tough jobs in city government, but leading the city\u2019s aging public housing system has got to be one of the very toughest. Ms. Olatoye is tasked with trying to find a way to make the New York City Housing Authority solvent again, and she\u2019ll seek to do so through the Next Generation NYCHA proposal, a controversial plan to lease green space on NYCHA property to private developers.\u000a\u000a33. Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ SEIU\u000a\u000aMr. Figueroa was another player in the major effort to increase the minimum wage in the state, first for fast food workers and then for everyone. He\u2019s also an outspoken advocate of immigration reform and gatekeeper of a union of largely Latino membership that helps sway local elections and endorsed Ms. Clinton for president.\u000a\u000a34. Julissa Ferreras, City Councilwoman\u000a\u000aThe chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s finance committee keeps a relatively low profile, but the Queens lawmaker is quietly one of the most influential council members and a candidate to replace Melissa Mark-Viverito as speaker. Were she to take the reins in 2018, she\u2019d be an automatic mayoral contender.

aVDuring the campaign for DNC chair, Tom Perez\u2019s supporters pushed against Congressman Keith Ellison\u2019s candidacy by claiming that the DNC chair needs to commit to the position as a full-time job. In response, Ellison promised to resign from Congress if he was elected DNC chair. Perez ultimately won the election, but so far his tenure has been far from stellar: The DNC has posted abnormally low fundraising numbers nearly every month since he took office.\u000a\u000aOn September 6, Perez accepted a teaching position at his alma mater, Brown University. The Providence Journal reported, \u201cPerez will lead a study group called \u2018Governance and Leadership in Challenging Times,\u2019 and it will feature speakers including Denis McDonough, Obama\u2019s former chief of staff; Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo; Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and others.\u201d Accepting a teaching gig in a separate state isn\u2019t going to improve the DNC\u2019s stature with voters or help it recoup its losses across the country. To make matters worse, Perez further alienates Native Americans by accepting the gig at Brown University while the Pokanoket Tribe has been protesting and marching over a land dispute with the school since last month.\u000a\u000aWhile he manages a party in disarray, Perez is taking a position usually reserved for retired elected officials. True to the course\u2019s name, this is a challenging time for the Democratic Party. Republicans hold majorities in both houses of Congress, and Democrats have lost over 1,000 seats in state legislatures across the country in the last decade. In 26 states, Republicans hold the governorship in addition to majorities in the state house and senate.\u000a\u000aThe DNC has done little to revamp its reputation, which was tarnished in the 2016 election after former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned due to favoring Hillary Clinton. Perez has ignored his promise to campaign in all 50 states. Instead of bothering to compete, he has conceded races in traditionally Republican strongholds. Additionally, after his Unity Tour with Bernie Sanders ended in embarrassment, he gave up on trying to unite the party\u2019s establishment with progressives. Democrats face a steep battle to recover their losses in 2018, but Tom Perez is dedicating his time elsewhere.

aVFor Solace London\u2018s designers, BFF duo Ryan Holliday-Stevens and Laura Taylor, New York Fashion Week is already off to a great start. Just 48 hours before the London-based design pair made their NYFW debut, Bella Hadid stepped out in one of their designs. The top model wore one of their long-sleeved shirts as a dress, sparking headlines such as \u201cBella Hadid Is Back to Her Pantsless Ways.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a season where it feels like everyone is abandoning New York Fashion Week for greener pastures (ahem, Paris), it\u2019s rather refreshing to hear that a few designers are coming to Manhattan for their show. And if it sounds like Holliday-Stevens and Taylor have embarked on a rather risky adventure, well, that\u2019s exactly because it was. However, their experiment in jumping across the pond is already off to a great start, save for one little snafu.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of the fabric arrived today and it was supposed to arrive a week ago, and it got stuck in customs,\u201d Holliday-Stevens said, less than 24 hours before showtime, while hunkered down in their temporary Fort Greene, Brooklyn headquarters. Despite the expected stress that comes with a fashion week production, the duo seemed cool, calm and in control. Just 24 hours before the show, the design duo was working closely with stylist Tom Van Dorpe on perfecting sleeve lengths and finishing tailored touches to skirts and trousers.\u000a\u000aThe Solace London team has been holed up in the studio for just under two weeks, preparing for the show. And they\u2019re grateful not to be in the hubbub of New York City. \u201cManhattan can be quite intense and we thought it might be quite nice to have the studio setup near where we\u2019re living. It\u2019s a quiet area and doesn\u2019t have the intensity of Manhattan,\u201d said Holliday-Stevens. \u201cIn the run up to the show, we\u2019re more chilled out.\u201d\u000a\u000aFounded in 2013, Solace London has quickly grown into a celeb-favored label. They\u2019ve already dressed the likes of Zendaya, Kendall Jenner, Chrissy Teigen and Olivia Palermo, while racking up an impressive list of international stockists including Net-A-Porter, Bergdorf Goodman, Galeries Lafayette, Harrods and so on. But they have a huge audience of shoppers in New York, hence their NYFW pilgrimage.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re best known for making killer red carpet frocks and extremely glamorous pants, but don\u2019t call Solace London an eveningwear line. \u201cI think the brand has evolved over the past four years. We\u2019ve introduced new cascades, new fabrication, but you can buy denim, jersey, leather and outerwear from us now,\u201d Taylor pointed out. And it\u2019s true; the standout pieces in the spring collection included a pair of slick culottes made from vinyl leather and a blue patchwork skirt, made from in the same shiny material.\u000a\u000aAside from a new location, this season marked a handful of other firsts for Solace London. They introduced shoes, with just one mule featuring a massive globular heel, and handbags, including one waist-bag that appeared to be just two external leather pockets. They also partnered with Net-A-Porter for their first see-now, buy-now collection. Head to the site now to scoop up a ruffled one-shouldered dress in canary yellow and a pair of black flared trousers with a sculptural ruffle.\u000a\u000aAn interesting fact about Holliday-Stevens and Taylor is that neither has a formal design background. As the FT puts it, \u201cRyan dropped out of university after completing a placement year and Laura studied English.\u201d But, as these two prove, sometimes a sense of style and a knack for designing isn\u2019t something you need to learn in a classroom.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s definitely two schools of thought with fashion design: You get the traditional way, where you start doing research, pick a theme and then you work around it. That\u2019s definitely not where we come from,\u201d explained Holliday-Stevens. \u201cWe look at how we can make something that is not available anywhere else, that fills the gap, that makes someone feel special, that\u2019s versatile, that feels incredible when its worn.\u201d And truly, what more could you want from your clothing?

aVThe NFL is always going to garner strong viewership as football is the most popular sport in America. But the attention paid to the game has waned just a bit in recent seasons.\u000a\u000aLast night\u2019s NFL kickoff between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots dropped 12 percent compared to 2016\u2019s season opener. According to TheWrap, KC\u2019s 42-27 thumping of the Pats scored a 14.6 rating/25 share. Super Bowl 50 between New England and the Atlanta Falcons also saw a 7 percent drop in viewership compared to the year prior. Last year\u2019s season-opener featured a rematch of the Super Bowl before it and put up a 16.5 overnight rating, per the outlet.\u000a\u000aDespite the slight downturn, NBC still won the night among adults in the advertiser-friendly 18-49 demographic. The 14.6 rating was more than twice as good as the primetime averages for the other three broadcast networks combined. The Nielsen rating is also the best for any network offering since June 12, so the sky is most decidedly not falling on the NFL.\u000a\u000aMany fans vowed to boycott the NFL last season amid former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s National Anthem protest. While #BoycottNFL campaign did pick up some steam online, the NFL\u2019s drop in viewership could be more closely tied to the 2016 presidential election. Three of the debates competed directly against NFL games, drawing millions of viewers away in some of the top-rated political clashes in TV history. This season, Kaepernick remains an unsigned free agent.\u000a\u000aOnce the election concluded, the NFL\u2019s ratings rebounded to previous levels. While nothing as nationally gripping as electing a new president is going down in the U.S. at the moment, it\u2019s too soon to say that the NFL has a ratings problem.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s check back in next week to see if this is just a blip on the radar or something that might continue going forward.

aVIn today\u2019s age of smartphones and Instagram, anyone can be a photographer and share images instantly. This might create the illusion that the role of the professional photographer\u2014or professional photography as a whole\u2014is dying, that it has been watered down. But when major events transpire, photojournalists are already there on the frontline, fitting into a few frames a whole story to be shared with those not present. Their images connect and allow the world to visually experience these events, no matter the distance.\u000a\u000aHugh Pinney has been working with photo distribution company Getty Images for nearly 15 years as vice president of news for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He spoke to Observer about the importance of photography in today\u2019s digital society.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn terms of imagery, it\u2019s how we communicate; it transcends words, verbal communication,\u201d Pinney said. \u201cWe\u2019re so accustomed to delivering messages through images that I think we have all become increasingly visually literate over the last few years.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut with all the photos posted and viewed on social media these days, a single image is one in billions: Can one image be actually powerful enough to stand out and evoke change? Pinney says yes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not pretend all photographs have the power. I think it is great photography, great photojournalism that has the power to change\u2026and to affect opinion.\u201d\u000a\u000aConservation Rangers from an anti-poaching unit work with locals to evacuate the bodies of four Mountain Gorillas killed in mysterious circumstances in Virunga National Park, Eastern Congo.\u000a\u000aOne such image is that of a dead silverback alpha male gorilla being carried out of Virunga National Park by an anti-poaching unit in Eastern Congo. Despite seeing hundreds of thousands of images, Pinney still comes back to this image, taken by photojournalist Brent Stirton, \u201cas something that is truly upsetting.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of Christ-like,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something biblical about the way that this enormous creature is being carried out by people who\u2026have been caring for it and have ultimately failed at their job to protect.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen asked about images that spoke to him immediately, Pinney mentioned one by photojournalist Chris Hondros, taken in Iraq in 2005.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat picture just immediately tells you that something has gone terribly terribly wrong,\u201d he said. Many knew of the tragic events, \u201cbut nobody photographed it, nobody [had] really witnessed it and seen it\u201d until photojournalists like Hondros began documenting them. After the image was published, the world was shocked and horrified, which lead the United States military to eventually change their checkpoint procedures.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn terms of photojournalism, I actually think that there\u2019s more opportunity now to tell stories in pictures than there ever has been,\u201d Pinney said. Our constant consumption of images has shifted how we observe major events, how we view the world we live in.\u000a\u000aOn September 11, 2001, photojournalist Spencer Platt was on the frontline. Platt\u2014who took the photo of Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center\u2014has been working as a photographer for Getty Images for the last 17 years and remembers the day clearly.\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember putting my camera up to my eye, and within seconds, the second plane slammed into the South Tower,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn a split second, Platt had taken an image that documented one of the most important days in contemporary American history. Having photographed many events in news and politics during his career at Getty (which lead to his winning of World Press Photo of the Year in 2007), Platt said he is still surprised at the impact that some of his images have made.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou often don\u2019t know the power of the image that you take,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not just war and major events, however, that led to such images. Sometimes, it\u2019s as simple as capturing a quiet moment that tells a greater story. In the above image, Princess Diana was photographed holding HIV-positive children. Despite the visual simplicity of the image, the moment speaks to a larger issue and a clear stance from an important figure.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget in this day and age quite what a superstar [Princess Diana] really was,\u201d Pinney said. In a time when there was much misunderstanding and prejudice around HIV/AIDS, the visual impact of a small action performed by a well-loved person was monumental. \u201cBeing photographed in those actions made an enormous impact on the wider world and the watching community.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople might remember the photos mentioned in this article, but that was before or early on in the internet. Now, we see thousands of images every day, whether scrolling through them on phones or glancing at them as advertisements on commutes. The photograph\u2019s role is shifting\u2014and ever more valuable. So, is there a formula to a powerful image, one that sticks with us, possibly even evoking some form of change?\u000a\u000aHugh Pinney said he believes it\u2019s the work of talented photojournalists that produces these images.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s very simple, very powerful, very good photojournalism that tells an entire story in a single frame in a very simple way,\u201d he said. Despite our constant consumption of images in this digital era, the importance of good photography has not been diluted: It is as strong as ever.

aVHave you wanted your very own version of the Titanic diamond necklace ever since you saw a young, pre-modelizing Leo clutch Kate Winslet on the bow of a ship? If you don\u2019t want a CZ knockoff and have yet to purchase the true diamond, there\u2019s still hope.\u000a\u000aCrown of Light, a New York-based, socially responsible company, created a custom Crown Glacier necklace with an 11.25 carat center blue diamond, accompanied by 4.32 carats of diamonds. It\u2019s reminiscent of the Titanic classic, but reimagined in a thoroughly modern way. Just hope you aren\u2019t wearing the new necklace on a sinking ship, as the total carat weight is quite hefty.\u000a\u000aThe real Titanic necklace did actually exist at one point, and it had quite the story\u2014although Rose was not involved, and did not pose nude to show it off. There was a diamond and sapphire necklace aboard the ship, given by the 40-year-old, very married Henry Morley to his 20-year-old love interest who was certainly not his wife. The pair were secretly sailing together to start a new life in America. Of course, the necklace wasn\u2019t exactly like the movie version, but it was equally expensive. The IRL \u201cHeart of the Ocean\u201d made it to America, and now lives in Florida.

aVWhile Gwyneth Paltrow\u2018s Goop Summit wasn\u2019t exactly embraced, it\u2019s not the only wellness-focused summit around, where you can learn about exactly what you should be drinking, eating and lifting. The Global Wellness Summit is coming to the Breakers from October 9 to 11, and the list of experts attending is far more advanced than Gwyneth\u2019s actress pals who attended the Goop Summit.\u000a\u000aUnlike the Goop extravaganza, which heavily featured yoni eggs and had panel appearances by Good Charlotte wives Nicole Richie and Cameron Diaz, GWS is invitation-only. In the past it\u2019s taken place in Turkey, Bali, India, Morocco and Austria, so the Palm Beach stop might be your best bet to acquire brand new wellness tips and tricks.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, there will be no talk of sex dust. Panel discussion topics include the origin of wellness, the impact of wearable technology and an appearance from Dr. Oz (the Goop Summit\u2019s brightest star was Tory Burch). There will also be sponsored talks by Weight Watchers, quick workouts and a chat about how millennials are disrupting wellness markets.\u000a\u000aThe Breakers is best known for being one of the few places where you can wear Lilly Pulitzer all year long, but they seem to be rebranding as a wellness destination. And if you tire of GWS, you can always venture a bit off the beaten path (maybe you can even grab a beer where there\u2019s no one there to judge you).\u000a\u000aWhile there won\u2019t be as many Instagram opportunities as the Goop Summit, maybe you\u2019ll actually learn something at this one.

aVAs a society, we struggle to distinguish between violence and the people who use it. Since we mostly associate violence with criminals, we tell ourselves that violence itself is criminal, violence is evil, violence is bad. We think that because violence is undesirable, to study it is to endorse it\u2014to say that we think it is desirable. There is a certain logic to this point of view at the surface. If criminals do something often enough, that something is probably going to be criminal itself. The problem with that logic, however, is that it conflates the means with the ends. Because we are so uncomfortable with violence, we have convinced ourselves subconsciously that the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d are the same things: in other words, we tell ourselves that, because criminals often use violence, violence itself is always criminal. But that\u2019s a big mistake: violence is a tool like any other. As with any other tool, the proper object of our moral and ethical judgment isn\u2019t the \u201cwhat\u201d\u2014after all, you wouldn\u2019t call a screwdriver or a toothbrush evil\u2014but rather the \u201cwhy,\u201d the ends to which human beings choose to direct it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s important to understand that the person who merely reacts to violence\u2014who is unwilling to meet their assailant on an even playing field when their own safety demands it\u2014is always at a disadvantage. Perhaps you want self-protection to be a sanitized form of violence, one that doesn\u2019t hurt quite as much. Sorry to say, there\u2019s no such thing. A knife wound inflicted in an act of self-defense looks just like a knife wound inflicted in an act of murder. Violence is violence.\u000a\u000aWhat that means is, we need to think about scenarios of violence not from the perspective of the victim, but of the winner\u2014even when the victim is the \u201cgood guy\u201d and the winner is a criminal. Of course, we can do that without condoning unprovoked violence or sympathizing with the criminal; we\u2019re not thinking morally here, but tactically. And tactically speaking, we need to answer some key questions about every violent encounter: When did everything shift to favor one person over the other? When did they get a result with the tool of violence? How did they get that result? Is it something that can be replicated by anyone on a regular basis?\u000a\u000aAgain, these aren\u2019t moral questions. Everything that happens prior to violence has a separate set of rules, many of which have to do with defusing dangerous situations before violence breaks out. Before violence, we can practice anger management, meditation, or simply the habit of walking away when situations get too heated. Similarly, everything that happens after an act of violence is handled by our justice system. That\u2019s when we start using words like \u201cself-defense\u201d or \u201cmurder\u201d (which are technical terms with very specific legal definitions). There are reams of books on either side of the discrete points of violence, but very few on the act itself. The story that follows focuses on the moments when violence is actually happening. That narrow window of time where we, as sane, socialized citizens, would be justified in using the tool in defense of self or others. My message is a simple one: to avoid being a victim of violence, you need to learn from it.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aI was once hired to give a self-defense presentation to a corporate group aboard a cruise ship. The company had arranged a Caribbean cruise for several of its employees and their families, and my presentation was informally billed as a kind of father-daughter event. One of those women, whom I will call Sara, was the daughter of a man I happened to know fairly well. He told me she was coming with him to the seminar whether she liked it or not, since she was getting ready to go to college. Many of the other daughters came to the seminar under a similar state of silent protest\u2014they wanted to go do other things, like tan or swim or hit the buffet\u2014anything else but this. I understood: it was the Caribbean, after all.\u000a\u000aWhen I met Sara she was a carbon copy of Reese Witherspoon\u2019s character in Legally Blonde. Bubbly and effervescent, she talked like her, she carried herself like her, she was just that girl. Learning about self-defense was clearly not at the top of Sara\u2019s list of priorities that afternoon, but to her credit she went through all the training with a standard level of disinterest and did nothing to make the event more difficult (unlike some of the fathers, intent on impressing their daughters). Afterward I didn\u2019t think much of our limited exchanges, frankly. It was just another corporate seminar.\u000a\u000aThree years later, I was holding a series of seminars in New York City and she walked in with her three younger sisters in tow. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t have quite the same stereotypical \u201cditzy blonde\u201d affect, but she looked more or less the same.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course I do. Nice to see you again.\u201d \u201cDid Dad call you and tell you what happened?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d\u000a\u000aSoon after the cruise, Sara moved into the dorms to start her freshman year. She had a first-floor room, a roommate, a lofted bed with a desk underneath, the whole college dorm experience. One morning, when her roommate was sleeping over at her boyfriend\u2019s apartment, Sara woke up with a man on top of her. This was not a drunken hook-up, this was a stranger. A man who had somehow managed to climb through Sara\u2019s window and up the ladder onto her platform bed without being detected.\u000a\u000aSara\u2019s nightmare scenario isn\u2019t a common one. Twenty-eight percent of sexual assaults are perpetrated by strangers,* but the reality is, women like Sara are much more likely to be attacked by someone they know. That statistical unlikelihood didn\u2019t make Sara\u2019s situation any less real. She could smell this strange man. He was grabbing at her. By the time Sara could clear the cobwebs from her brain, he had her pinned and was about to pull back the sheets. Most young women\u2019s first reaction in this scenario would be to scream. Not Sara. She instantly recognized the situation she was in. Her first reaction wasn\u2019t a reaction at all, it was a thought: \u201cHe\u2019s not close enough.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring our training aboard the cruise ship, we ran the girls through a series of sexual assault scenarios. One of the things we taught them was that after a man grabs you, in order to perpetrate a rape he will have to move in at least two ways: 1) he will have to remove, unzip, or pull down his pants, and 2) he will have to remove or pull down any of her clothing obstructing his path. In this scenario, he would also have to pull down the comforter and sheets under which Sara was sleeping. When that moment of adjustment occurs, the attacker will have to loosen control of her body and remove at least one of his hands from her. Doing so would also bring him closer to her and expose one of his most vulnerable body parts\u2014his face. So, Sara waited. The next thing she realized was that to escape this situation unharmed she would have to inflict an injury. She wasn\u2019t going to escape by yelling\u2014 only by doing, and by doing something terrible. Pinned to her back, with his legs positioned inside hers, the only vulnerable body part she could reach was the man\u2019s eyes. (It was one of several body parts we trained briefly with her cruise group.)\u000a\u000aSure enough, the man began to adjust. He pulled down the sheets and then his pants, forcing him to lean in closer to her. That\u2019s when Sara snapped into action. She wrapped her left arm around the back of his neck, and attacked his left eye with her right hand. She remembered from the seminar that when you attack anywhere on an assailant\u2019s face\u2014but especially the eyes\u2014they are going to move away from you violently. This is both an instinctive self-preservation response and an attempt to retain control of the situation by pulling away from the attack. If you\u2019re a young woman like Sara, who weighed probably 110 pounds at the time, that means you can\u2019t let up. You don\u2019t have the same margin of error as a man or a larger woman. You literally have to hang on for dear life, and keep attacking.\u000a\u000aSara\u2019s attacker was easily 235 pounds, and strong. When she dug into his eye, he wrenched back in the opposite direction like a rodeo bull. Their combined momentum pulled them both off the lofted bed and onto the hardwood floor below. Knowing something like this was going to happen, Sara focused on her grip around the back of the man\u2019s neck and latched on. While her grip around his neck stayed secure as they fell to the floor, she lost her grip on his eye and her forearm slipped down his face. This was not a conscious decision on Sara\u2019s part, but as they hit the ground, she sent all her 110 gravity-aided pounds through her right forearm and into his throat.\u000a\u000aShe felt the injury happen right as they hit the ground. His body went weak. Any vile intention his brain may have been conjuring became moot the moment his body ceased to function at its command. This gave Sara the opportunity she needed to get away and run screaming down the hall for help. By the time campus security got to her room, the man had asphyxiated and died right where they\u2019d landed.*\u000a\u000aCan you imagine yourself in Sara\u2019s situation? Someone bigger, faster, and stronger than you, crawling silently into your bed? Can you imagine having the guts to stay calm and plan your attack? Sara had guts. She had composure. And the thing that anchored both of those traits was her training. The second the man grabbed her, Sara told me it was like I was in her ear. This is a foundational truth about violence and self-protection: When random violence finds you, you\u2019re only ever going to be able to do what you\u2019ve trained to do, and you\u2019re only going to be able to draw from your established knowledge base. Sara had just one training session (which she didn\u2019t even want to be in), and from that limited exposure to instruction alone she knew three important things: that she couldn\u2019t compete with her attacker\u2019s size, that she would need to inflict an injury, and that once she did, she had to stay on it. All this information was stored in her brain for instant recall when her life was at stake.\u000a\u000aIn moments like the one described above the difference between acting and reacting can be the difference between life and death. In all my studies of self-protection, training and debriefing military units and law enforcement agencies, examining security footage from prison yards and talking to prison guards, I have discovered that the odds of winning a violent encounter swing precipitously in favor of whoever inflicts the first debilitating injury. That doesn\u2019t mean anytime you feel nervous or fearful that you should impulsively look for stray chef\u2019s knives or ready yourself for well-timed eye gouges. You should always endeavor to remove yourself from any situation in which you are uncomfortable. What it does mean, however, is that if you are getting asocial cues from someone, you need to act. If violence becomes inevitable and inescapable, you must never hesitate to harness your knowledge and lean on your training to protect yourself. You must never let thoughts about what violence means or says delay its utilization, because in those moments where it is necessary, there is no room for nuance and semantics. There is no time to parse a predator\u2019s intent, to figure out what is going on inside their head, to understand how they think and what kind of moral code they have (or don\u2019t have). Even if there were time, those things are basically unknowable.\u000a\u000aYour power is in your knowledge and understanding of violence, in your awareness and preparedness, in your training and capacity to act. Every time you shrink from an act of violence like those Sara endured, or you project empathy toward a person who is showing you their true colors, or you choose to make some directionless prayer like, \u201cI hope that never happens to me!\u201d, you are relinquishing all that power. You are giving first-mover advantage to your\u000a\u000apotentially mortal opponent. If you take one thing from what you\u2019ve read so far, I hope it\u2019s this: anytime you attempt to bury your head in the sand and deny the existence of violence in your world, not only are you giving up your power, but you are giving it over to the very perpetrators of random violence whose existence you are hoping to ignore.\u000a\u000aInstead, look violence in the eyes and ask yourself, \u201cHow did that work?\u201d Because in learning what the tool of violence truly is and how it really works, we remind ourselves that the perpetrators of violence are human beings\u2014the same as us. We possess the same abilities, with access to the same tools. The difference between us is not in the \u201cwhat,\u201d but in the \u201cwhy.\u201d\u000a\u000a* According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) and a 2015 Department of Justice survey on national crime victimization .\u000a\u000a* When campus and local police investigated the events, they discovered that the man was a serial rapist who had been terrorizing that campus and a couple others in the area for nearly six years.

aVThe NJ Sharing Network Foundation is welcoming Yvonne Payne of Teaneck to its Board of Trustees \u2013 two years after she received a life-saving heart transplant.\u000a\u000aPayne eagerly looks for opportunities to honor the memory of child actress Sammi Kane Kraft, whose tragic death in a 2012 California car crash meant a new heart and a new chance at life for Payne.\u000a\u000aPayne lead a team at NJ Sharing Network\u2019s 5K Walk and USATF-Certified Race on June 8, raising thousands of dollars for the life-saving mission.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am touched by the entire NJ Sharing Network organization,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI definitely want to help out and ensure as many people as possible know the importance of registering for organ donation, especially in the Black and Latino communities. I want to share my story with others and hope they can support this beautiful organization.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayne \u2013 wife of Fox Business Network contributor Charles Payne \u2013 is inspired by her heart donor, Sammi Kane Kraft. Kraft, whose real-life baseball skills landed her the starring role as a spunky pitching ace in the 2005 remake of \u201cBad News Bears,\u201d died Oct. 9, 2012, at the age of 20.\u000a\u000aFour days later, Payne underwent heart transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Today, the lively 56-year-old Teaneck woman is determined to give back something tangible to other people in need \u2013 including her service to the Foundation.\u000a\u000aPayne recalls an \u201cactive and athletic childhood,\u201d but rheumatic fever at age 13 left her with a weak heart and prone to fatigue due to arrhythmia. \u201cI learned to cope and tried to be as active as possible as a teenager and young adult,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy heart always seemed so noisy in my chest,\u201d she recalled. In her mid-30s Payne was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening rapid heartbeat that ultimately required her to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctors told me I would eventually need a heart transplant. That was a frightening idea, so I kept telling myself and everyone else that I\u2019d be just fine,\u201d Payne said. By 2011, her condition worsened and her bouts of exhaustion became more frequent.\u000a\u000aPhysicians at New York Presbyterian implanted a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in July 2012 to provide temporary relief. \u201cAn LVAD is a bridge-to-a-transplant until a heart is available,\u201d said Payne, noting that her recovery and potentially long wait for a donor brought on \u201cfear and depression.\u201d\u000a\u000aA personal phone call from former Vice President Dick Cheney helped lift Payne\u2019s spirits. \u201cIt meant so much. Mr. Cheney had LVAD surgery too. He told me to have faith, stay strong and leave my depression behind,\u201d said Payne, who had met Cheney once while visiting friends in Wyoming.\u000a\u000aWhile the LVAD helped for a short while, her condition turned critical less than three months later when she developed a blood clot in the LVAD and doctors told her she needed an immediate heart transplant.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also needed a miracle,\u201d Payne said. It came in an emotional phone call from Shelly and Lulu Kane Kraft \u2013 Sammi\u2019s parents and friends of Payne\u2019s husband, Charles. \u201cThey knew about my condition, kept me in their prayers and were calling to say they wanted their daughter\u2019s passing to help me live,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWithin 48 hours, the Paynes flew to Los Angeles and Yvonne underwent transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai. \u201cThe first thing I recall when I woke up after surgery was the quiet. It was the first time my heart was really ever silent,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDirected organ donation, which Payne underwent, is not normal for emergency situations and is considered rare. Most people receive the gift of donation from an anonymous donor. For directed organ donation, blood types must be compatible between donors and intended recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Payne is devoting time and energy to offer hope to others facing heart transplants and making a similar journey through her service with the NJ Sharing Network Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cYvonne\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment is an inspiration to us all,\u201d said Elisse Glennon, executive director, NJ Sharing Network Foundation. \u201cWe are excited to be working with her. She is a dynamic person who will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goals. We are especially pleased about her commitment to outreach to minority communities and look forward to working closely with her in the coming months and years.\u201d

aVSugar Sammy is a comedian, actor, writer and producer from Montreal. He tours internationally, in English, French, Punjabi and Hindi. He mainly performs stand-up comedy but boasts a large body of work, including three one-man shows, an original TV series on Canada\u2019s French V network and an HBO Canada special (the first of it\u2019s kind). He\u2019s performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal seven years in a row and in his four fluent languages. The Observer sat down with Sammy to discuss his impressive body of work and the unique style he\u2019s developed by performing in such diverse cultural landscapes. Sammy will be headlining Caroline\u2019s Comedy Club in New York City July 13, 14 and 15.\u000a\u000aYou were just in Austin, which leads me to my first question: I know you\u2019re on sort of a U.S. run right now, how\u2019s it been treating you?\u000a\u000aGreat, it\u2019s been fun to discover how different the U.S. is from state to state, from city to city, how different their points of view are, their politics, their demographics, religious beliefs, it changes depending on what area of the country you\u2019re in. You know, one of the things they say about America right now is that it\u2019s so divided. I mean, America is also so diverse in terms of its composition, but the diversity doesn\u2019t melt together. It\u2019s diversity by region, it\u2019s weird.\u000a\u000aYeah, it\u2019s kind of atomized in a weird way, especially right now, but it makes sense that you would notice that as someone who speaks four different languages, tours internationally and things like that. How do you find yourself adjusting your material when you travel?\u000a\u000aThe material is the same, what changes is the reactions. But a lot of times I\u2019m surprised, I was just in Naples, Florida, which is one of the highest populations of Trump voters. I was bringing my material there, coming from a Canadian perspective, and I was really surprised because these people were losing their minds laughing at this material where I was nervous going in there, I was like, \u201cI know it\u2019ll work in Seattle, I know it\u2019ll work in San Jose, I know it\u2019ll work in different places, but I was completely surprised by how well it worked there.\u000a\u000aDid you book Naples for that reason?\u000a\u000aI booked Naples because they wanted to book me. A lot of snowbirds\u2014a lot of Canadians\u2014go there for the winter, so they\u2019ve been bugging the comedy clubs to book me there. I was also insisting on doing it because I wanted to test the material democratically everywhere.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s one thing about road comics\u2014you don\u2019t get into bubbles a lot of the time. You\u2019re not just talking to your own people. Did a lot of Canadians come see you?\u000a\u000aA lot, but also social media gets a lot of people in. Also I used to tour the states, I used to headline the states a lot from around 2009 to 2011, whereas currently I\u2019m spending a lot of time in Canada and Europe, so I have a lot of fans here that it\u2019s been good to get back to, to say I\u2019m back.\u000a\u000aTell me about that. When you perform in France, and you perform in other languages, do you find that comedy works differently in other languages\u2014or is it more of a cultural thing?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s more of a cultural thing, that\u2019s so interesting, you\u2019re the first person that\u2019s asked that question. It\u2019s not a linguistic thing. Linguistically, you have to adjust a little bit in that you have to make sure you get to the punchline as quickly as possible, but the material stays the same and the structure stays the same, you just gotta find that bridge between the language and the way it works because it was constructed in English, but it works in other languages. I\u2019ve done it French, Hindi and Punjabi, and you just gotta find the cultural material that connects to that audience. Linguistically, if I had a French or Indian audience in New York, I\u2019d do the same material I do about the states, but I\u2019d do it in French, and it still works.\u000a\u000aA lot of people will say that with something like, let\u2019s say, hip-hop, that it only works in English style rhyme scheming or something.\u000a\u000aHip-hop is more beautiful in French! You gotta check out this rapper, he\u2019s a legend in France, he\u2019s called MC Solaar, in French his stuff flows better. And similarly France is now starting to have the stand up tradition. I think the difference was for years they\u2019d have these one-man shows where they\u2019d be doing characters and their mom and their uncle and stuff like that, like what you guys would call an Off-Broadway show or whatever, but in the last five years we\u2019ve seen these stand ups come out. And it\u2019s the art form that becomes the norm. Five years ago when they were doing these one man shows they\u2019d ask me, \u201cWould your material work there?\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople who\u2019ve done Edinburgh say it\u2019s like that a lot of the time. They\u2019d do these tight New York one-liners, and people just didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u000a\u000aYeah, but you just gotta do what you do best. You can break through with them a lot; that\u2019s the art form\u2014it\u2019s more conversational. And even if it\u2019s a cultural shock for a second, you can get through to them. It doesn\u2019t feel like this guy\u2019s just doing this schtick up there where he doesn\u2019t acknowledge us and he\u2019s just doing the same stuff every night. There\u2019s all these improvisational elements going on. It\u2019s a lot like jazz in that they\u2019d do five or six shows a weekend and record all of them and then pick the one they liked the best, because it\u2019s not gonna be the same show, it changes depending on the audience. And there\u2019s that dance with the audience that\u2019s the important part, they\u2019re listening to us as much as we\u2019re listening to them.\u000a\u000aYour material is very crowd-work heavy and that makes a lot of sense. Somebody once told me the audience is like an instrument and when you\u2019re doing crowd work you\u2019re like jamming, you know?\u000a\u000aYeah! That\u2019s so true.\u000a\u000aSo where\u2019d that style come from? I\u2019ve noticed with crowd work and people that are really good at it, they work in clubs a lot, like proper comedy clubs where the audience is people that are on dates as opposed to audiences in bars or what have you. You came up in Canada right?\u000a\u000aI came up in Canada but I toured everywhere, but I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of our headliners in Canada and England are really good at crowd work because we value the emcee role a lot, so what happens is, a lot of headliners, when they have a weekend off, they host. And it\u2019s valued and paid the same as headlining because it\u2019s treated like the most important role in that show, Whereas here it\u2019s different, the hierarchy and pay is different. In England it\u2019s always been a five-man show where there\u2019s four headliners doing 20 minutes apiece and an emcee, and everyone gets paid evenly, and you\u2019ll see headliners emcee very easily.\u000a\u000aSo did you do a lot of that?\u000a\u000aI did a lot of that, and so you develop that skill very easily, and I just find it becomes a very fun part of the show. I\u2019ll have my material but I like going and using the crowd and talking to them, who knows, something might happen, or I\u2019ll bounce ideas for a new bit off of them. And also, I\u2019ll tape every show and the best crowd work, I\u2019ll use that as promotional material, because you don\u2019t want to burn your actual material you know? It\u2019s not like music where they want to hear the same joke over and over. So it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving them a part of the show without burning any of the show.\u000a\u000aDo you find that when you travel, are you trying to bring what you do to those new places or are you adjusting to how they respond?\u000a\u000aI think a bit of both, I bring what I do, but I make it about them. Like you said about being an anthropologist, like when I go to France I notice these little tiny things that are commonplace for them and then I point them out and it becomes funny because they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right it\u2019s funny, but we never talk about it,\u201d but I also talk about myself and the Canadians point of view and how we\u2019re different. And you can\u2019t be a caricature, you can\u2019t do it from afar, you gotta be immersed in it. It\u2019s happening as I\u2019m in New York right now, I\u2019m noticing these things.\u000a\u000aHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been in New York?\u000a\u000aI was here last month, at the French Comedy Festival. I hosted one gala in English. It was all French comedians doing comedy in English for the first time and a few Americans, and then I played my show in French for a half-French crowd and a half-Qubcois crowd, and I like that; I like it when I have to switch languages and switch cultures because it keeps your brain sharp\u2014you\u2019re always working, you\u2019re never on autopilot.\u000a\u000aYeah, you definitely have to keep yourself in the moment so you don\u2019t become a robot.\u000a\u000aYeah, and that\u2019s the danger, that\u2019s why I like the crowd work, and that\u2019s why I like moving around. You know, I was touring Quebec for five years, and I was having a great time, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was growing as a writer, as soon as I flew into France my writer brain went crazy. I would be up all night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019d be having to write all this stuff down. I feel like you have to get out of your comfort zone, which is why I like going to other countries so much.\u000a\u000aPeople say that about writer\u2019s block, that you have to shake things up, but then the question is always, How? That seems like a really good answer. Man, this is fun. I feel like I could pick your brain all day. We could do a full Maron episode right now, but I\u2019ve got to let you go. So, to round things out, let\u2019s talk about your career. You\u2019ve accomplished quite a bit: What\u2019s next? Tell me about the future.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s always about doing more, doing something different. For me it\u2019s never been about all that other stuff, It\u2019s always been about being able to get up, write, work on stuff, be on stage every night if I can. Once I started getting really famous in Canada I left for a while because I was like, If I enjoy this too much, I\u2019ll get lazy, and then I\u2019m just thinking about not losing what I have, and if you write when you have a lot to lose, I find it\u2019s never gonna be as good as when you write when you have nothing to lose. So I\u2019ll go to a fresh new market where I have nothing to lose and push myself as far as I want, and if it doesn\u2019t work, I can always go home later, you know? The best thing is having that freedom, being able to create the work I want to create.

aVPodcast listeners like the ads and would be happy to listen to even more of them. That\u2019s according to Westwood One, a company that sells audio content in various formats including podcasts and radio shows.\u000a\u000aUp next, look for a report from Apple as the new iPhone drops next week showing mobile users would prefer to pay even more for new devices. The week after that, a report from Exxon showing automobile owners favor stable gas prices over low ones.\u000a\u000aWestwood One released its new report today called \u201cThe Podcast Download.\u201d The company commissioned consumer researchers at MARU and Vision Critical to conduct a study of people who have listened to at least one podcast in the last week.\u000a\u000aThey surveyed \u201ca nationally representative sample of 600 respondents\u201d who were over 18, regular listeners and who don\u2019t work in media. The survey was conducted online for a few days starting near the end of July.\u000a\u000a\u201cPodcasting is undercommercialized,\u201d Pierre Bouvard, the chief insights officer for the company told attendees at the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s 2017 podcast upfronts on Thursday. It was a room ostensibly filled with potential podcast advertisers.\u000a\u000aWestwood One, it should be noted, runs its own podcasting network, featuring shows on news, sports and entertainment topics. It claims to reach more than 245 million weekly listeners.\u000a\u000aBouvard presented four findings from the survey:\u000a\u000aA small but not negligible group of listeners (17 percent) speed up podcasts while listening, at least sometimes. Regular listeners don\u2019t mind the ads (many even like them). Listeners would be fine with more ads, especially on longer shows. People say they would pay for an ad-free version of their favorite show.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not unusual to hear podcasters argue that their commercials are value added. Westwood One\u2019s respondents said that they like the ads they hear and 40 percent said they tend to search out the brands that they hear about.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worth noting that what people say and what they actually do in practice turn out to be wildly different things on a fairly regular basis. On the other hand, Stamps.com and Mailchimp wouldn\u2019t keep buying spots year after year if they weren\u2019t doing something.\u000a\u000aBut even the report\u2019s own findings illustrate how survey results can get a bit fuzzy. Respondents said that they listened to more podcasts per week than they downloaded. It\u2019s not clear how that\u2019s really possible, but downloads can be weird, as we\u2019ve previously reported.\u000a\u000aWestwood One argues that most listening is driven by the medium\u2019s biggest fans, the people who spend more than six hours per week listening. This segment of the audience is 68 percent male, 92 percent under 50 and 69 percent earns more than $75,000 per year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe more people listen, the more people love the ads,\u201d Bouvard said. \u201cLove for podcast content translates into love for the ads.\u201d\u000a\u000aWestwood One has been publishing these download reports since 2015. Advertisers surveyed have increasingly expressed greater interest in promoting their brands using on demand audio, with 27 percent reporting this year that they are likely to purchase ads on podcasts in the next six months (up from 10 percent in 2015).\u000a\u000aThe report\u2019s findings might be a bit exuberant, but there\u2019s little doubt that podcast advertising is working well. The industry is projected to bring in more than $220 million this year.

aVNEWARK \u2013 World leaders gathered on Tuesday in Johannesburg, South Africa to honor Nelson Mandela, a man who dedicated his life to fighting, and defeating, apartheid, a system of racial segregation embedded in his country\u2019s laws and enforced by its police. When remembering Mandela, New Jersey\u2019s leaders have mentioned a disturbing truth \u2013 the Garden State, in many ways, suffers de facto segregation that leaves its citizens separate but unequal.\u000a\u000aIt was Gov. Jim Florio who first coined the term \u201cthe two New Jerseys\u201d in his 1990 inaugural address, the same year Mandela was freed from prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor New Jersey to be truly a commonwealth, we simply cannot have two New Jerseys,\u201d Florio said. \u201cOne where youngsters go off on a road to college, and another where youngsters go off on a road to despair. One where towns flourish with the rewards of prosperity, and another with decaying cities, littered with abandoned cars and abandoned hopes.\u201d\u000a\u000aNearly 25 years later, the hope of closing this gap is a dream deferred.\u000a\u000aOne example of the continuing divide between rich and poor New Jersey was underscored by recent studies released jointly by Rutgers-Newark and UCLA in October. Stark numbers presented in the reports indicate that in the 2010-11 school year, almost half of black and Hispanic students attended schools where fewer than 10 percent of the students were white, and many attended schools where there were essentially no white students. The Rutgers report from the university\u2019s Institute on Education Law and Policy went so far as to call 191 of 1,597 schools statewide \u201capartheid schools,\u201d defined as schools where 1 percent or less of the student population is white and where at least 79 percent of students are low-income, a \u201cdouble segregation\u201d marked by race and poverty.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Dr. M. William Howard, Jr., pastor of Newark\u2019s Bethany Baptist Church and the former chairman of Rutgers\u2019 Board of Governors, met Mandela personally as a result of his decades-long anti-apartheid activism.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew Jersey is arguably one of the most racially segregated states in the nation,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe question for me is not only race, but economics. Black people came to places like Newark, Paterson and Camden from the South to find work. That work has now disappeared, but those residents remained. The absence of capital, combined with a smidgen of racism, has produced the separation of families, decline in housing, increase in crime, and decline in the public schools in the cities. You will find black people living in some of the wealthiest suburbs in the state, provided they can afford the housing, and therefore have access to the suburban public schools.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we face today in our urban centers in our state is what Mandela still faced at the time of his death in South Africa,\u201d Howard added. \u201cIf we were to go together now to South Africa, we would find millions of black people living in the same squalid conditions that they knew before Mandela was released from prison. And we would find certain highly educated, economically advantaged black people now living in opulent, suburban areas. I\u2019m sure than Mandela recognized this, was not happy with this, and saw it as the long-term work of the South African government and society to correct this imbalance. New Jersey\u2019s cities are largely populated by people who are unlikely to be able to access the modern economy. You cannot explain the horrific situation of segregation in the state of New Jersey only in terms of race. To continue to chip away at public schools by the introduction of charter schools to the point that they are almost tipping the balance in places like Newark is a big mistake. Education is not only the key to reviving our central cities \u2013 it\u2019s the key to keeping our competitive edge in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoland Anglin, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers, noted that the man seen as the father of South Africa would take a similar guiding hand to the Garden State\u2019s problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would first say that we need to look at the things that created segregation in New Jersey, just the way he looked at the things that created segregation in South Africa,\u201d Anglin said. \u201cI think he would say that the thing South Africa did with their struggle, that we perhaps need to do, is to have a clear and decisive forum for reconciliation and move forward on the things that are still problematic. In Newark, for example, we\u2019ve never come to a real reconciliation about the disturbances of the 1960s, and how society needed to do more to make sure that those who have been left behind have an adequate opportunity to progress so that balanced communities can be formed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have the suburbanization of people of color in New Jersey, but they are being re-concentrated in pockets,\u201d Anglin added. \u201cResidential patterns are not happening in a way that promotes upward mobility. Change involves some level of enforcing fair-housing laws that challenges landlords who won\u2019t rent to certain racial minorities coming out of urban areas. It also involves some level of incentives and social engineering. We don\u2019t have that appetite as a society, much less as a state. Nelson Mandela would say that we need to cement the public will on all sides to make change, not just people in urban areas \u2013 that\u2019s a doomed strategy. It is no one\u2019s interest to have a poor, under-fed class of people who don\u2019t have access to opportunity. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that they participate in the public life and economic life of this state and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor her part, Assemblywoman Grace Spencer (D-29) recalled protesting against apartheid during her college years. Many commentators have observed that there were two distinct periods in Nelson Mandela\u2019s career: a confrontational period where he advocated armed struggle against apartheid, the other a more conciliatory period after his release from prison that smoothed the way to majority rule in South Africa. Regarding what kind of public leadership is needed to end de facto segregation in New Jersey, Spencer suggested the adoption of a hybrid tone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe person who is rambunctious and defiant begins to call attention to de facto segregation in New Jersey,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut you also need the person who is more conciliatory who can bring people together and mend the wounds of the problem. I don\u2019t think apartheid would have ended if it wasn\u2019t for the rambunctious Mandela, and I don\u2019t think there would have been such a good transition without the conciliatory Mandela. You need both.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the man who encapsulated the concept of two New Jerseys, what must be done to end de facto desegregation in the state is clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would feel a need to speak out and point out the deficiencies that exist. We still do have two New Jerseys. Things have changed a bit, but only for the worse,\u201d Gov. Florio told PolitickerNJ.com. \u201cThe middle class is now feeling threatened by economic problems as well. It\u2019s going to take policy changes to make us a much more egalitarian society. Mr. Mandela would be out in the forefront trying to get those changes made.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need leadership that is willing to tell people things that they don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Florio added. \u201cAt this point, there are no good options. It\u2019s the difference between losing a finger and being decapitated. During the gubernatorial campaign we just went through, neither of the candidates, nor the press, talked about the overwhelming fiscal problems we\u2019re going to have in New Jersey in the coming years. That\u2019s because if you talk about it, someone is going to ask you what you\u2019re going to do about it. We all know poverty exists. But somebody\u2019s got to start talking about it. Somebody\u2019s got to be out front. Nelson Mandela is a good example of someone who was willing to take on things that were much more burdensome than things that we experienced. If he was willing to do that, then we have to have people who will at least raise issues for debate.\u201d

aVHillary Clinton\u2019s continued influence on the Democratic Party is obstructing its progress by suppressing opportunities for fresh leaders to arise and conflating criticisms of Donald Trump to revenge for Clinton. This week, a few pages leaked from Clinton\u2019s new book in which she blames Sen. Bernie Sanders for her loss to Trump. Instead of admitting faults in her campaign, she victimizes herself and blames a variety of scapegoats.\u000a\u000aDuring an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on September 7, Sanders responded to the excerpt claiming he undercut Clinton\u2019s policy ideas by stating, \u201cDoes anybody really believe that?\u201d He continued, \u201cThe truth is and the real story is that the ideas that we brought forth during that campaign, which were so crazy and so radical, are increasingly becoming mainstream.\u201d Sanders cited these policy ideas as a $15 minimum wage, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan he introduced nearly a year before Clinton\u2019s plan was introduced, and single payer health care, which has become increasingly popular despite Clinton claiming it will \u201cnever, ever come to pass.\u201d Sanders also advocated for free public college tuition, which Clinton ridiculed during the primaries but took credit for earlier this year when Sanders and Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to provide free public college tuition in her home state, New York. Further, Sanders introduced his youth employment plan two weeks before Clinton introduced her apprenticeship program, making Clinton\u2019s claims that Sanders stole her ideas as demonstrably false. Nevertheless, mainstream media has branded the excerpt from her book as factual.\u000a\u000aSanders\u2019 presidential campaign fought for progressive policies, as outlined in his book that stemmed from the 2016 election, Our Revolution. Sanders\u2019 book encourages his supporters\u2019 enthusiasm, while Clinton\u2019s new book tries to re-write history and revamp her supporters\u2019 disdain for Sanders. But some Clinton supporters have pushed back on the narrative she is trying to put forth.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe best thing she could do is disappear,\u201d a former Clinton fundraiser and surrogate who played an active role at the convention told The Hill. \u201cShe\u2019s doing harm to all of us because of her own selfishness. Honestly, I wish she\u2019d just shut the f\u2014 up and go away.\u201d Congressman Jared Hoffman, who supported Clinton in the primaries, told Politico, \u201cShe\u2019s got every right to tell her story. Who am I to say she shouldn\u2019t, or how she should tell it? But it is difficult for some of us, even like myself who\u2019ve supported her, to play out all these media cycles about the blame game, and the excuses.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn focusing on how Sanders supposedly undercut her, Clinton\u2019s revisionism fails to admit that her campaign was desperately trying to keep up with Bernie Sanders\u2019 popularity. She resisted increasing the debate schedule, which was ultimately reduced from 26 debates in 2008 to six in 2016. The DNC rescinded their ban on corporate lobbyist and PAC donations to help the Clinton campaign raise money with the Hillary Victory Fund. Sanders never ran an attack ad against Clinton, even though Obama did in 2008. Further, Clinton\u2019s claims that Sanders hurt her candidacy fail to acknowledge that primaries are a necessary part of American democracy. Her campaign had an abundance of advantages but suffered from complacency and arrogance.\u000a\u000aSince the election, Bernie Sanders\u2019 and his policies have become mainstream, but Clinton and her supporters continue to blame him for her loss. Her book is a desperate attempt to salvage her reputation\u2014even if it means further fracturing the Democratic Party.

aVThe legalization of marijuana may soon replace abortion as our society\u2019s most controversial issue. Like abortion, the debate never seems to end.\u000a\u000aDuring the 1970s, a government commission recommended that marijuana use should not be criminal or subject someone to indictment based on its findings that it posed very little risk to the public. However, President Nixon took a different direction, declaring all drug abuse as \u201cpublic enemy number one in the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was created in 1970 to determine how marijuana should be regulated under federal criminal law. When the Controlled Substances Act was passed, Congress tentatively classified it as a Class I substance; however, legislators also acknowledged that additional study was warranted to verify if it indeed warranted the law\u2019s harshest designation.\u000a\u000aAfter conducting extensive studies, the Commission found that many of the negative public opinions about marijuana were unfounded. \u201cLooking only at the effects on the individual, there, is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the experimental or intermittent use of the natural preparations of cannabis,\u201d the report stated. On the basis of its findings, the Commission also recommended that simple possession should be decriminalized, concluding:\u000a\u000a[T]he criminal law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate. The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only \u2018with the greatest reluctance.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe recommendations were unexpected and met with significant resistance from President Nixon. He even attempted to influence the Commission\u2019s findings by strong-arming its chairman, Raymond P. Shafer, whom Nixon had believed would come down against legalization. \u201cYou\u2019re enough of a pro to know that for you to come out with something that would run counter to what the Congress feels and what the country feels, and what we\u2019re planning to do, would make your commission just look bad as hell,\u201d Nixon stated.\u000a\u000aUltimately, nothing became of the report, as neither the Nixon Administration nor Congress took any further action. As a result, marijuana remains a Class I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Ironically, the classification is reserved for drugs with \u201chigh potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment.\u201d\u000a\u000aDonald Scarinci is a managing partner at Lyndhurst, N.J.-based law firm Scarinci Hollenbeck. He is also the editor of the Constitutional Law Reporter and Government & Law blogs.

aVAs Conde Nast looks set to announce consolidation of its publishing division following similar changes at Hearst Magazines last year, other, smaller players in the sector have better news. New York-based niche magazine, Paper, just celebrated its 32nd successful year in print. Meanwhile, in Munich, Germany, Platea, an independent art and fashion magazine, rejoiced its snowballing readership. The quarterly magazine targeted at young creatives has been in business for less than two years and already garnered a loyal audience within Europe. Likewise, The Gentlewoman, a magazine based in London aimed at intellectual women with \u201cstyle and purpose,\u201d has been growing exponentially throughout a seven year run.\u000a\u000aVestoj, Dazed and Confused, Love, Kinfolk, V, Interview, and System are independent magazines, some names less familiar than others, enjoying growing success while their mainstream counterparts such as Instyle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan have shown a consistent drop in circulation. At a time when print is seemingly waning with many titles now transitioning to digital-only, the success of mainly fashion-based indie magazines seems puzzling. Yet, a quick look through any of them reveals one simple ingredient: contemporary voices and a deeper connection with the audience. The content and design appeals to those attracted by new, avant-garde inspiration and is unfettered by fashion advertising behemoths. This is not to say though, that fashion brands are not on board. Many are lining up for space in the most influential spots and the kudos of appearing alongside raw, emerging talent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNiche and indie magazines are very in touch with their audience, they tend to be lean mean fighting machines, often run by a single person who can nimbly engage with their audience far more easily than a mainstream magazine that\u2019s often weighed down by too many people involved in the decision making & production process,\u201d James Hyman told observer.com. Hyman is founder of The Hyman Archive in London, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest collection of magazines.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost independent titles consist of small teams, often dispersed across different parts of the world. Instead of self-aggrandizing and building personal brands, niche editors are motivated by a sense of purpose and enthusiasm for their publication\u2019s cultural role. The key word here is \u2018niche,\u2019 something most commercial fashion magazines have lost sight of, with far too many similarities between them. \u201c[Independent] magazines have smaller teams and lower overheads, and are published less often. Smaller teams mean more focused, controlled decision-making. The mainstream, on the other hand, has commoditized itself and become repetitive, and more concerned with business rather than being creatively focused,\u201d explained Jeremy Leslie, creative director at MagCulture, one of the most respected magazine stores in London stocking over 350 different titles.\u000a\u000aHe added that most mainstream magazines are now at a point where they don\u2019t have a voice of their own and have become clones in terms of both character and physical nature, \u201c [They\u2019re] all the same size, same paper, same number of pages. Straight in the recycle bin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertising pressures are one of the top reasons for the decline in the quality of content in traditional print titles. A source close to I-D, a British art, fashion and youth culture magazine confirmed how it lost a chunk of its readership as their content became more commercially driven, after being bought by Vice in 2012, a multimedia company partly owned by Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new I-D magazine is just another place to view cool work\u2014no thoughtful criticism or fascinating narrative that once made it worth reading,\u201d noted an agitated user on a reddit thread.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you need to please advertisers, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to take risks and when you\u2019re aiming for demographics, you\u2019re not going to go out on a limb and do something really different,\u201d said Steven Watson, founder at Stack Magazines, a subscription service that selects and delivers new, independent titles to users every month.\u000a\u000aAlthough independent publications don\u2019t have mighty commercial obligations at their heels, they do need support. Penny Martin of The Gentlewoman, noted that although they are growing, with \u201ca very healthy advertising quotient of around 30 percent,\u201d they don\u2019t let that interfere with the content, \u201cWe are working with companies who respect our independent ideals and understand that a magazine publishing long form articles and lavishing space on typography and design has fewer pages to display product.\u201d\u000a\u000aTypically created with an immense attention to detail plus great design and photography and in some cases better paper quality\u2014some small titles become minor works of art. \u201cI wanted to do print to have a platform to cherish the content I collect. It has a stronger appearance and is more special. It doesn\u2019t get thrown away. Crafting magazines is an art form and a lot of people are involved and brought together to create something that you can touch and feel. It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Tristan Boettcher, editor in chief at Platea.\u000a\u000aWatson added that the superior quality of these young titles has made them a luxury product and more collectible than the old guard. \u201cIt\u2019s in part a response to the mainstream which over the last 10 years has reduced the thickness of the paper to make it cheaper and reduced the budgets because of falling revenues. So now a group of independent magazine makers have decided, \u2018Magazines don\u2019t have to be like this, we can print magazines in beautiful thick paper, with beautiful typography and design and we could charge 10 for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy becoming an indispensable item, the indie magazine circuit is also winning the print versus digital debate, where online media just can\u2019t offer the quality or longevity that these publications do.\u000a\u000aWatson argued that niche publications don\u2019t see digital as competition or a threat but as a tool to further their own popularity. \u201cI think it\u2019s really about what makes your product different from everything else. Build everything around that thing. Then not only does it become something that you can\u2019t get online, you can\u2019t get that anywhere else. That is really the magic of these publications.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis doesn\u2019t mean the bells are tolling for all traditional magazines. U.S Vogue, for instance, consistently re-invents content, featuring youthfully influential and diverse personalities and blasting a hole in tradition with the controversial but ultimately successful, Kimye cover. Modern publishing requires a rethinking of purpose. Leslie advised that it is all about striking a balance between familiarity and repetition, and celebrating the possibilities of the manufacturing process without losing its uniqueness, \u201cCreatively, print is bang in the center of a hugely innovative golden age. Just be sure of your magazine\u2019s point of view and personality and don\u2019t be a cheap copy.\u201d

aVThe Democratic establishment is desperately trying to find new faces to use to boost the party\u2019s failing brand. As such, Congressman Joseph Kennedy III has emerged as the latest faux hero of the Trump resistance. Nancy Pelosi is grooming him for party leadership due to his name recognition and connections to donors. His grandmother, Ethel Kennedy, hosted fundraisers for his 2015 election, selling tickets for $38,800 each. Politico recently published a profile on him that read like an advertorial. It touted his family name but attempted to assert his individuality\u2014without actually pointing out anything unique about his politics besides citing viral video clips of him. The article noted, \u201cStill, those who have known Kennedy for years say the speech and several others since then, including one viewed more than 15 million times touting diversity after white nationalists\u2019 violent Charlottesville rally, represent the person they have always known, the man who finally seems to be coming into his own on Capitol Hill.\u201d\u000a\u000aKennedy\u2019s top campaign donor in 2016, Crescent Capital, profits from investing in debt. His top campaign donor in 2017 is Bank of America. He has also received donations from Bain Capital and Citigroup. Donors to his leadership PAC include oil and gas exploration company Global Petroleum, weapons manufacturer Raytheon, Merrill Lynch, and other Wall Street firms. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws rated Kennedy a \u201cD,\u201d in line with most Republicans, even though Massachusetts decriminalized marijuana last year. Kennedy has also advocated for using military force against Iran. Though the majority of Democrats in the House have co-sponsored a Medicare for All bill, Kennedy has refrained from doing so. In 2012, Kennedy co-sponsored a bill to raise the cap on loans from the Export-Import Bank by $25 billion, 83 percent of which went to Boeing. This bill highlights that Kennedy wholeheartedly supports free trade, which has traditionally benefited corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working, middle class, and low income Americans.\u000a\u000aEstablishment Democrats are enamored with Joe Kennedy because he fundraised for Hillary Clinton alongside Chelsea Clinton, has strong relationships donors and lobbyists, and his politics are moderate. Politicians like Kennedy won\u2019t fight against wealth inequality and war or fight for workers\u2019 rights and social justice because they accept campaign donations from corporations that profit from these inequities. Instead, Democrats like Kennedy depend on political theater and marketing viral moments to manufacture support.\u000a\u000aThe political establishment expected Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush to be the frontrunners in their party\u2019s primaries in the 2016 election. Despite being well-funded, Bush\u2019s campaign floundered, and though Clinton managed to win her party\u2019s nomination, her record proved to be a liability. The last few decades have been dominated by Bushes and Clintons, and now some in the Democratic Party are trying to develop a new dynasty to compensate for their lack of new ideas.

aVDisney CEO Bob Iger revealed Thursday night that the Mouse House\u2019s upcoming streaming service will launch in 2019 and will be taking all of the company\u2019s Marvel and Star Wars films with it. That means Netflix subscribers better catch up on the MCU and the galaxy far, far away while they still can because the movies won\u2019t be there for long. As if keeping up with the constant deluge of blockbusters and interconnected universes these days wasn\u2019t difficult enough.\u000a\u000aPer THR, Disney will launch its ad-free streaming service but will keep its current slate of films on Netflix for the next two years. Once Disney\u2019s new direct-to-consumer platform launches, it will feature around 500 films and around 7,000 episodes of Disney TV.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will have the entire output of the studio, animation, live action at Disney, including Pixar, Star Wars and all the Marvel films,\u201d Iger said. On top of that, the Disney-branded app will feature around four to five original TV series, and the studio will produce three to four TV movies specifically for the streaming service. It will also include recent seasons of Disney TV series and some short-form original content.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have to think of the Disney app as a traditional SVOD service,\u201d Iger told investors. The CEO did not specify what kind of monthly fee customers will be facing, but did try and tantalize with the promise of a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of content.\u000a\u000aLook, we get it. This is a great money-making opportunity for Disney and at the end of the day, the bottom line is all that matters. But is it fair to expect fans to shell out for subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu, YouTube Red, Apple, Amazon and Disney? Despite the proliferation of alternative viewing options, the increasing streaming competition has made it virtually impossible to stay on top of a lot of must-see content. And now they\u2019re taking Moana and Rey away from us. It\u2019s a sad day for couch potatoes everywhere.

aVFormer White House chief strategst Steve Bannon told CBS News that Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s response to a leaked video of President Trump bragging about groping women cost him a cabinet position in the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cChristie, because of Billy Bush weekend, was not looked at for a cabinet position,\u201d Bannon said in an interview on 60 Minutes.\u000a\u000aBush was the host of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in 2005 when Trump made the lewd comments. Video of Trump\u2019s remarks to Bush resurfaced in October 2016 and put the Republican nominee\u2019s campaign in turmoil with a month to go before Election Day.\u000a\u000aBannon told CBS that the aftermath of the tape\u2019s release was a loyalty \u201clitmus test.\u201d Christie failed that test when he didn\u2019t defend Trump during the low point of his campaign, Bannon said. Christie at the time called Trump\u2019s comments \u201ccompletely indefensible\u201d after the video surfaced, but said he still supported him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI told him the plane leaves at 11 o\u2019clock in the morning. If you\u2019re on the plane, you\u2019re on the team. Didn\u2019t make the plane,\u201d Bannon said of Christie.\u000a\u000aChristie was reportedly offered cabinet positions, including labor secretary, after Trump won the election. On Friday, a Christie spokesman said Bannon\u2019s comments were false.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs has been widely reported, the governor had been offered multiple cabinet positions in addition to other senior posts in the White House and elsewhere,\u201d Christie spokesman Brian Murray said in a statement. \u201cHe chose to stay as Governor and complete his term. Any assertion to the contrary is simply factually incorrect.\u201d

aVWith the sad, slow death of print media, there\u2019s one unlikely phoenix that has risen from the ashes of the glossy magazines that have folded in the past decade.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll let fashion illustrator Bil Donovan explain: \u201cSocial media has re-energized fashion illustration. Anyone can see it.\u201d He pointed out these fanciful paintings or drawings once lived only within the pages of a glossy magazine, but now can be consumed on apps like Instagram and websites like Facebook or Tumblr. \u201cIt\u2019s created a new audience, so to speak. It\u2019s an audience that really has an appreciation for the work, which to me, is incredible.\u201d\u000a\u000aDonovan, a notable member of the fashion illustration community, mostly works in watercolor, brushing life into a gown presented on the runway or a model posing in his Bushwick studio. He has watched his career take off alongside these very visual social media platforms. Though he had years of experience under his brush\u2014receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts from the School of Visual Arts plus a fashion illustration degree from FIT and working in Milan for six years with clients such as Marie Claire Italia and Italian Vogue\u2014the late aughts was when he really blossomed.\u000a\u000aIn December 2008 American Vogue hired him for a series of three events, the third of which was for a Christian Dior party on Madison Avenue. Dressed in a suit and a Dior tie (that the brand lent him), Donovan was tasked with drawing portraits of over 50 top clientele. The Dior shoppers loved the attention and the executives loved the outcome. However, Donovan had to return the Dior tie at the end of the night.\u000a\u000aJust a few months later, in April 2009, they approached him with a job offer and he became the first Artist in Residence for Christian Dior Beauty. It\u2019s quite a hefty title, but what does it entail? Well, Donovan goes to various store events and creates fashion portraits for the big spenders\u2014though the high profile shoppers do have to reserve a spot ahead of time and receive a Dior makeover. Sometimes, Donovan works with the fashion side of the brand, painting the women who shop the couture selection from the boutique on New York\u2019s 57th Street or the ready-to-wear in Miami. But there\u2019s one Dior project that seems to be his favorite\u2014and it all started with a cocktail.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also work for the St. Regis. Years ago, the creative director for Starwood asked me if I could draw a cocktail the same way I painted a dress. So I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 Now, I do all the illustrations of their cocktails when they open up a new establishment,\u201d he explained with a paintbrush in hand, pausing to ask the model in his studio to change her pose. When the hotel decided to renovate the Christian Dior Suite in New York, they wanted to decorate the walls with an illustration of some frocks and knew Donovan would be great for the job\u2014without realizing he was already affiliated with the brand. Naturally, Pamela Baxter, Dior\u2019s president at the time, loved the idea and Donovan\u2019s couture watercolors are now immortalized on the walls of the iconic New York hotel.\u000a\u000aDior isn\u2019t the only brand that Donovan has wooed. The illustrator has created masterpieces from the runway collections of Rosie Assoulin, Ralph Rucci, Carolina Herrera and Thom Browne, the latter of whom is notoriously selective about who he lets backstage.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was trying to be as inconspicuous as possible,\u201d explained, when he arrived at the Thom Browne show in 2014. \u201cI remember they were doing makeup and I went to a corner and I found a little trunk and I was drawing. [Thom] came out and I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in trouble.\u2019 Then he came over and said \u2018These are beautiful.\u2019 I asked, \u2018Is this okay?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Make yourself at home.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHis work has also been acknowledged\u2014and acquired\u2014by the Met. When Harold Koda, the longtime curator-in-chief of the Anna Wintour Costume Center, retired in January 2016, the museum banded together with Vogue to present him with a book that depicted 36 of the outstanding pieces he had garnered via donations over the years. Donovan illustrated 11 of those pieces, included the iconic Safety Pin Dress that was created by Versace and famously worn by Elizabeth Hurley. That book now sits on the shelves of the Library of the fashion institute.\u000a\u000aThis fall, Donovan and a few other fashion illustrators will be celebrated at the \u201cDrawing On Style: Original Fashion Illustration\u201d exhibit, pulled together by London\u2019s Gray M.C.A., at Cheryl Hazan gallery. Work from modern master Jason Brooks and legendary creative Kenneth Paul Block will also be on display. If you can\u2019t make it to a fashion show this season, this is certainly a must-visit New York fashion event, as it will be on display from September 5 to 10.

aVA list of the most memorable characters of New Jersey political history would have to include David Friedland, a Jersey City Democrat who served in both houses of the Legislature and then went to prison only after leading federal marshals on a worldwide chase to find him.\u000a\u000aAfter his 1980 criminal conviction for taking a $360,000 kickback for arranging a loan to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 701 pension plan in North Brunswick, Friedland agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and was placed in the witness protection program. He was later indicted on charges of defrauding the Teamsters pension fund while under federal protection.\u000a\u000aIn 1985, while awaiting sentencing, Friedland disappeared. He faked his death in a scuba diving accident in the Bahamas, but authorities found the evidence suspicious and continued to look for the former Hudson County Senator. Using a fake U.S. passport, he had traveled to Europe, Asia and Africa. Two years later, the U.S. Marshal from New Jersey, Arthur Borinsky, captured Friedland in the Maldives Islands, off the coast of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean. As the owner of chain of five scuba diving shops, Friedland was living an opulent lifestyle that attracted the notice of local officials.\u000a\u000aFriedland grew up in a political family: his father, Jacob Friedland, represented Jersey City in the State Assembly from 1939 to 1951. The elder Friedland had a law practice that represented labor unions; he was convicted in the same kickback scheme as his son, and at age 79, was sentenced to two years in federal prison.\u000a\u000aDavid Friedland was elected to the State Assembly in 1965, at the age of 28. In 1968, Deputy N.J. Attorney General William Brennan III (the son of the Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court) charged that several state legislators were \u201centirely too comfortable\u201d with organized crime figures. Friedland was later identified as one of those legislators, although a grand jury never filed charges against him.\u000a\u000aHe was elected Assembly Minority Leader in 1971. Later that year, the New Jersey Supreme Court suspended his license to practice law for six months because of unethical behavior. Friedland was accused of conspiring with the Woodbridge Township Prosecutor, Norman Robbins, to drop criminal charges against a loanshark with ties to Joseph Zicarelli, the alleged Hudson County crime boss. Friedland was re-elected to the Assembly in 1971 by a wide margin.\u000a\u000aAfter Democrats won control of the Assembly in 1971, Friedland engineered a deal with Republicans to elect Thomas Kean as Speaker. Four Democratic Assemblymen, including Joseph Higgins (D-Elizabeth), agreed to back a Republican for Speaker in exchange for committee chairmanships and staff.\u000a\u000aFriedland did not seek re-election to a fifth term in 1973, but came back four years later to run for State Senator. His fortunes improved in May 1977 when Thomas F.X. Smith was elected Mayor of Jersey City, and in June 1977 he ousted incumbent Joseph Tumulty in the 32nd district Senate primary. He forfeited his seat upon his criminal conviction.\u000a\u000aAfter his capture, he was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. Higgins, who was part of the Democratic coalition that helped make Kean the new Assembly Speaker, was later sentenced as part of the same scandal that brought Friedland down.\u000a\u000aFriedland was released from prison in July 1997 and now lives in Florida.

aVABC announced Thursday that former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer will give his first late-night interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live following his departure from the Trump administration. The possibilities are endless.\u000a\u000aSpicer will join Kimmel on Wednesday, September 13, so mark you calendars ladies and gentlemen. The guy was, shall we say, rough on camera when it was his job. Let\u2019s see how he comes across when it\u2019s just for fun (or, you know, a pseudo-job interview).\u000a\u000aSpicer announced his resignation from Team Trump back in July, though we all know that politics-code for \u201cfired.\u201d The move came after months of contentious daily press briefings and multiple media gaffes that Melissa McCarthy absolutely hammered in her Emmy-nominated impersonation for Saturday Night Live.\u000a\u000aPer Politico, Spicer will kick off his post-White House career as a speaker with Worldwide Speakers Group, beginning with the annual conference held by investment bank Rodman & Renshaw on September 11. He is expected to sign book and television deals in the near future as well. That should be interesting.\u000a\u000aDear @SeanSpicer \u2013 if I promise to look AT the camera this time, will you come to my show next week? pic.twitter.com/KcVA5xUzeC \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aIt's a deal, does next Wednesday work? https://t.co/7iYmUtvSyj \u2014 Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aThe Spice master was said to have clashed with Anthony Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director for less than two weeks. \u201cThe Mooch\u201d made his own late-night debut post-White House on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in August, which provided Colbert with his second-biggest win over The Tonight Show\u2019s Jimmy Fallon to date.

aVJennifer Lawrence, busy promoting her new horror feature mother!, suggested that Mother Nature is punishing the United States with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma for electing Donald Trump as president despite his disbelief in society\u2019s impact on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, it\u2019s this new language that\u2019s forming. I don\u2019t even recognize it. It\u2019s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,\u201d Lawrence said in an interview with British Network Channel 4 on Wednesday. Check out the video below.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, you\u2019re watching these hurricanes now, and it\u2019s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it\u2019s just really confusing.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State, told the Observer that the scientific community believes climate change is creating stronger storms.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is scientific consensus now that the strongest hurricanes will get stronger as the world\u2019s oceans warm, at a rate of roughly 10 miles per hour for each degree Fahrenheit of warming,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe past few years have been the warmest years on record for the world\u2019s oceans, and it isn\u2019t a coincidence that over this time frame we\u2019ve seen the strongest storms ever, as measured by peak sustained wind speeds, for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, Pacific, and now with Irma, the open Atlantic.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Academy Award-winning actress described the current U.S. political climate as \u201cpolarizing and upsetting,\u201d and did not feel confused by any of Trump\u2019s words or actions. \u201cI think I know exactly what he is.\u201d\u000a\u000aBack in October 2015, Lawrence told EW that electing Trump would be \u201cthe end of the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollowing mother!, the 27-year-old actress can next be seen in Red Sparrow and Fox\u2019s X-Men: Dark Phoenix.

aVCould Ruth Negga pull an upset on Sunday night at the Academy Awards? The Ethiopian-Irish actress doesn\u2019t have her knickers in a twist over it \u2013 the stunningLoving lead, 35, is on a collision course with stardom and, win or lose, doors are swinging open in Hollywood. The petite actress removed her Prada heels and dug in with the Observer to discuss her extraordinarily ordinary heroine. Mildred Loving, a modest Black woman who married a white man in 1958 and courageously battled the Virginia anti-miscegenation laws for love, equity and the fundamental right for a man and a woman to have a family in the United States.\u000a\u000aWould you call yourself brave?\u000a\u000aRuth Negga: Definitely not. I\u2019m the scaredy-est cat I know. I would hope I\u2019d be brave and that in certain situations, when it would call for it, that I would stand up. But am I tough? I can be quite tough \u2013 but it\u2019s not angry small women\u2019s syndrome.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not?\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not. When you\u2019re small and people address you in that patronizing way, and you think please don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t think being brave and being tough are necessarily mutually exclusive, but you can be either or in certain situations. No one is any one trait 24/7. In order to be brave you need to understand what it is to be fearful. Isn\u2019t that what they say?\u000a\u000aDo you consider Mildred Loving brave?\u000a\u000aAbsolutely! I think she\u2019s brave, but I don\u2019t know if Mildred thought that she was brave. And I can only access that. I had to leave my thoughts out, because I was playing her. For Mildred, she was just pursuing her right to justice. I don\u2019t think she thought it would take nine years. Can you imagine? Every step of the way, she was just doing, and I think sometimes just getting on with things and doing are extraordinary acts of bravery.\u000a\u000aCan you elaborate?\u000a\u000aAnyone who\u2019s had to confront a situation where they feel like they had to fight a little harder, or overcome obstacles, it becomes second nature. Nothing\u2019s going to be handed to you, so in a weird way, you develop this amazing not even a work ethic, but you\u2019re like a Duracell battery. You\u2019ll outlast everyone. You have the ability \u2013you just need the opportunity. The opportunities have to be there. That\u2019s all that people need.\u000a\u000aWhen did opportunity first knock in your own career?\u000a\u000aI was very lucky to get a job right out of college in Dublin [Trinity College\u2019s The Samuel Beckett Centre]. Just before I graduated, Annie Ryan cast me as the title character in a stage version of Nabokov\u2019s Lolita. It\u2019s one of my favorite books. It\u2019s amazing and horrifying \u2014 and this was amazing and horrifying.\u000a\u000aDo you see the lover and the monster in the lecherous character Humbert Humbert, who would now likely be on the sex offender registry?\u000a\u000aIt scares us because we see that those things can live side by side within certain people. It\u2019s scary because we don\u2019t want to know that we can be capable of grotesque acts. I think we\u2019re desperate, aren\u2019t we, to iron out nuances and complexities in life because we think it makes life more palatable. But, in fact, it\u2019s just making it more difficult because it\u2019s luring us down the primrose path, which is wrong. It means that we understand each other less and less and ourselves less and less, because if we forgo the nuance, then we\u2019re just not going to make any progress.\u000a\u000aYou definitely explore the dark side in your violent, volatile comic-book anti-heroine Tulip O\u2019Hare in the AMC TV series Preacher.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s something grotesque about Tulip. I wanted her face to even be grotesque sometimes. But still be peculiarly magnetic and sexy and, like, everything that women are rarely allowed to be on our screens \u2014 because we are in real life. Like me and my girls, like we were all of those things. I I thought I\u2019d like to contribute to that broadening of female roles. Tulip\u2019s fun and she\u2019s feisty. And then she\u2019s not so fun and she\u2019s not so feisty. I embrace the complexity and nuances \u2014 and that she\u2019s funny. I find her funny.\u000a\u000aOne of your signature qualities is large expressive eyes out of proportion to your frame.\u000a\u000aI have a real sticky face. I have no poker face. It\u2019s actually handy being an actress, though. I\u2019ll take the lack of poker face.\u000a\u000aWhat did you take away from living in Mildred\u2019s shoes?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think I can sum it up in a sentence, really. I think that anyone who worked on this film surrounded by those two people, Mildred and Richard Loving, can\u2019t help but find their goodness infectious, and aspirational. I think I\u2019ve internalized it for my heart. Mildred\u2019s still there. Some characters stay with you for a while; others, I find their scent gets less strong. Some people are forever etched into you.\u000a\u000aLike Mildred Loving?\u000a\u000aVery much so.

aVHurricane Irma has already broken the record for the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic due to maintaining winds at 185 mph for more than two days. Further, this is the first time since 2010 that three hurricanes\u2014Irma, Katia and Jose\u2014have been active in the Atlantic Basin. The characteristics of the hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean this year affirm the risks associated with climate change; global warming results in the development of stronger, more intense hurricanes.\u000a\u000a\u201cHurricanes derive their energy from heat released from the evaporation of warm ocean water. The warmer the ocean surface, the more energy there is to develop and intensify these storms,\u201d Dr. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State, told the Observer. Mann recently appeared in Before the Flood, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s documentary on climate change. He continued, \u201cThere is scientific consensus now that the strongest hurricanes will get stronger as the world\u2019s oceans warm, at a rate of roughly 10 miles per hour for each degree Fahrenheit of warming. The past few years have been the warmest years on record for the world\u2019s oceans, and it isn\u2019t a coincidence that over this time frame we\u2019ve seen the strongest storms ever, as measured by peak sustained wind speeds, for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, Pacific, and now with Irma, the open Atlantic.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Mann stated that the frequency of hurricanes this season isn\u2019t as much cause for alarm as their rapid intensification. \u201cHarvey was the wettest storm on record in the U.S. as a result, in part, of very warm Gulf ocean surface temperatures, which meant there was more moisture in the atmosphere available to be turned into record flooding rainfall. And Irma is now the longest-lived category 5 storm in history for the Atlantic. That is due to the very favorable environment it has found in the form of very warm ocean surface temperatures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. We see them playing out in real time, and this last couple weeks is a stunning example of that.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite this obvious evidence of climate change, climate change \u201cskeptics\u201d and deniers have continued to argue that there is no scientific evidence proving climate change. Several evangelical Christian leaders in Texas blamed Hurricane Harvey on gay people, and conservative outlets like Breitbart pushed editorials denying the link between hurricane intensification and climate change.\u000a\u000aDr. Mann explained, \u201cWell, first of all, many of those who call themselves climate change \u2018skeptics\u2019 are actually the opposite. All good scientists are skeptics, demanding logic and evidence, which must be all the more compelling the more extraordinary the claim. But those who reject overwhelmingly established science\u2014like the fact that human activity is warming the planet and changing the climate\u2014based on the flimsiest of arguments that don\u2019t stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny are not skeptic. They are contrarians or, in many cases, simply deniers of established science. But with regard to the specific subject of these recent hurricanes, the science is very clear on the basics: Warmer oceans mean stronger storms, more flooding rains, and global sea level rise has worsened every storm surge. To deny these facts is literally to deny basic physical science.\u201d

aVNASA has shared numerous findings about how space looks and feels, but its newest project is giving the solar system a whole new sonic dimension.\u000a\u000aThis week Wyclef Jean released \u201cBorrowed Time,\u201d the latest single from his forthcoming album Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee (out September 15). The song, available on Apple Music and iTunes, features sounds recorded by NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter since last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I heard was a collage of vibrations that sounded to me like a piano,\u201d Jean told USA Today. \u201cI heard low tones, mid-range, high tones \u2014 it almost sounded like a new patch of sonics that have not been revealed yet to the public.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Haitian singer described \u201cBorrowed Time\u201d as a socially conscious song which marries Earth and space.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe whole idea of this record is, between Earth and space, we\u2019re really on borrowed time,\u201d Jean said. \u201cSo we have to love each other, not hate each other. We have to try and be progressive and move things forward, not backward.\u201d\u000a\u000aJean worked with astrophysicist Scott Bolton, the principal investigator behind Juno, while composing the song.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll around us, nature is in harmony,\u201d Bolton said in a press release. \u201c\u2018Borrowed Time\u2019 is a perfect example of the power possible when we blend the arts and sciences.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarnival III, which also features earthbound artists like Emeli Sand, isn\u2019t NASA\u2019s first time melding science and music. Last year Oscar-winning composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed a nine-minute piece called \u201cJuno\u201d to mark the beginning of the Jupiter mission. Weezer, Brad Paisley and Corinne Bailey Rae have also partnered with the space agency.

aVAlan Rickman, who generated plenty of goose-pimples in his all-too-brief career, once confessed his scariest moment occurred when auditioning for Judge Turpin in the Sweeney Todd film: \u201cStephen Sondheim walked into the room and said, \u2018Sing.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s good to report that Jake Gyllenhaal, who just made his Broadway musical debut in Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, was spared this special terror even hardcore career singers know to dread. For that, he can thank Jeanine Tesori.\u000a\u000aThe Tony-winning composer of Fun Home, in her capacity as Artistic Director of Encores! Off-Center (New York City Center\u2019s series of four-day Off-Broadway revivals), hired him twice for his heretofore unknown musical gifts: first, suddenly, as Seymour in Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman\u2019s Little Shop of Horrors and then as Georges Seurat, painting his famed \u201cSunday on La Grande Jatte\u201d in Sunday et cetera.\u000a\u000a\u201cJeanine and I went through the music, and I felt she was\u2014without letting me know\u2014testing me in the process,\u201d recalled Gyllenhaal. \u201cMaybe they were a bit sneaky. They made it seem like I didn\u2019t have to, but I must have been auditioning.\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal\u2019s suspicions are correct: \u201cSteve just said, \u2018Can he sing it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes. Absolutely!\u2019 And that was it,\u201d Tesori relayed. Not so fortunate was Gyllenhaal\u2019s leading lady, Annaleigh Ashford, who plays Seurat\u2019s mistress and muse, Dot.\u000a\u000aShe\u2019s the proven musical-comedy talent (with a Tony nomination for Kinky Boots and a Tony win for You Can\u2019t Take It With You), but she had to sing for Sondheim.\u000a\u000aWhen the offer came, she was eight months pregnant (which, actually, would have worked for Dot) and in L.A. \u201cI had to make a recording for him so that he knew that I could sing the low notes in the opening number because it\u2019s quite low for a lady voice,\u201d remembered Ashford. \u201cThat was a magical moment for me. I was in my underwear, recording it on my computer on GarageBand, and I gave him extra scales to show him how high I went up. Then, I sent that little mp3 off, and here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aTesori suspected a musical career might be lurking in Gyllenhaal when she heard he did musicals in high school. That, plus the fact that they shared the same agent, cinched the deal. \u201cWhen I was putting Little Shop together, I asked our agent if Jake would do it. He said, \u2018He might. Let me ask him.\u2019\u201d The actor was interested enough to have lunch with Tesori and discuss the possibilities. \u201cHe was doing Constellations at the time, and I started pestering him. But it wasn\u2019t until I went backstage and left him a plant that had little legs and hands on it\u2013with ketchup\u2014that he said \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal and Ashford, basking in the extra rehearsal, turn in assured, risk-taking portrayals. \u201cAs intimidating as his music is, it\u2019s also incredibly enveloping,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as you feel it in the audience, you feel it doing it as a performer. You feel safe.\u201d\u000a\u000aLa La Land musicals being all the rage now, the two leads were asked what film musicals they\u2019d like to do. Ashford paused a thoughtful beat and declared \u201cThis!\u201d\u000a\u000aThen, on further reflection, she amended that from Sunday to any given Sondheim: \u201cHis body of work is so special it\u2019s almost indelible in the lexicon of art. We should try to explore his pieces on film. It\u2019s important his work be celebrated on screen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat particular question has never come up before for Gyllenhaal, being so new to musicals. \u201cI\u2019m asked that a lot about roles in general,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe way this thing came together was serendipitous in an unlikely combination of elements\u2014almost like fate impeding and pushing in the way that it needed to be expressed. That\u2019s generally how I look at [roles] at this point. I\u2019ve never been someone who said, \u2018I want to do that,\u2019 though at some point I guess Tevye might be a good idea.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, how close does Seurat come to other characters that Gyllenhaal has played? \u201cThere\u2019s an obsessive quality to him, a focused quality that connects to a lot of characters I relate to and have played. One way or another, they\u2019ve all been leading to George, so I\u2018d probably say, really, all of them\u2014even The Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aSondheim and his director-book writer, James Lapine, drew a soaring celebration of the creative spirit from the two years Seurat spent turning chaos into coherence and disharmony into harmony for his masterpiece. As such, it seems the perfect vehicle to return the Hudson Theater to theatrical life after a half-century of other venues.\u000a\u000aGingerly tending the transfer of a book-in-hand City Center concert to a full-on, affecting Broadway production is Lapine\u2019s niece, Sama\u2013and that\u2019s not the naked nepotism it might seem. In fact, she said, \u201cIt was very cool the way it came about at City Center, really a kind of collaborative discovery between James and Jeanine.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen it became clear that the original director would not be free to repeat the chore\u2014he was busy reviving Falsettos on Broadway the same week Sunday was slated for City Center\u2014Tesori suggested getting a young up-and-coming director to do it, perhaps even a female one, and started feeding Lapine resumes to that effect.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, suddenly, he said, \u2018Oh, wait a minute, I know a fabulous young woman director, and she has already done the show!\u2019 So he called me, and we got together.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer previous Sunday had been a regional production in Columbus, Ohio. She also did a Sondheim concert with the Boston Pops in which she got to stage the painting with only six actors. \u201cIt taught me a lot about the minimalist take on such productions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d appears to be thrilled with not only the show\u2019s return but his niece\u2019s handiwork as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it without his love and support, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aRashly, before the generally rhapsodic reviews came out, the producers voluntarily withdrew the show from Tony Awards consideration so they wouldn\u2019t have to dole out 1,600 comps to voters\u2014a perilous proposition for such a short (ten-week) run.\u000a\u000aThat leaves Gyllenhaal and Ashford clinging to the \u201cIt\u2019s the work, not the reward\u201d maxim for dear life, but both can make it through without that shiny piece of silver.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a line in the show: \u2018the art of making art,\u2019\u201d Ashford pointed out. \u201cWhen I walk in the door every day, I think, \u2018We really are here for \u2018the art of making art.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal, likewise, high-roaded it: \u201cI think the performers on Broadway who have long runs work so hard for a long period of time after all the fanfare and all the excitement has passed. That\u2019s a big part of the win, in my opinion, or the nomination of a Tony. We\u2019re doing a lot of hard work right now, but our run is only ten weeks, and that is just a fact. We all know, too, that, as much as it\u2019s an honor and a history, it\u2019s also a business, and I think that business and these awards are also about getting attention and making sure that people see . . . these extraordinary shows that are on Broadway now. The most important thing for us is to get people here to see the show . . . and to make sure people keep coming back to Broadway, so there\u2019s no reason to usurp any of that. We should all be a community supporting each other.\u201d

aVWe knew New Line and Warner Bros.\u2019 It was going to be a monster at the box office and now we have some figures to back that up. The Stephen King adaptation followed up the worst box office weekend in years with a smashing $13.5 million in Thursday night previews, per The Wrap. It is now the largest horror, R-rated and September pre-show ever. Boom.\u000a\u000aThis puts it well on pace to top 2002\u2019s Hannibal ($58 million) and Hotel Transylvania 2 ($48.4 million) as the biggest R-rated horror opening and September opening, respectively, of all time. On top of that, It is looking like a good bet to become King\u2019s highest-grossing adaptation ever both domestically and worldwide. The two top spots in both categories currently belong to The Green Mile and 1408. Who knew we\u2019d ever be rooting for a demonic child-killing clown?\u000a\u000aTracking for It has projected anywhere between $60 million and $70 million this weekend, which is an absolutely terrifying number. But with near universal critical praise and a strong nostalgia push, it\u2019s easy to see why It is connecting so well. It\u2019s also reassuring to King fans to see one of his masterpieces breakout after the disappointing and generic flop that was The Dark Tower.\u000a\u000aIt is based on King\u2019s seminal 1986 horror novel of the same name that sees a group of friends battle an evil entity responsible for the deaths of countless people over the years known as Pennywise the Clown. The book toggles back and forth between the childhood and adulthood of its protagonists. It, directed by Andres Muschietti, follows our heroes as children before the planned sequel (which absolutely should be titled It: You\u2019ll Float 2) checks back in on them as adults.

aVIn 1776, the 13 American colonies along the eastern seaboard of the North American continent were part of a global empire comprising the world\u2019s leading economic and military power at the time. What drove the colonists to declare their independence from that economically and militarily dominant empire, even engaging in violent revolution against it?\u000a\u000aEven the early roots of America were extremely prosperous. By 1776, that had given Americans the confidence to think they could do better on their own.\u000a\u000aWhen the American people feel prosperous, they want freedom and independence. But when they feel mired in economic struggle, they look to the government for help.\u000a\u000aIn the 65 years following the Civil War, the American people felt prosperous and confident. America had emerged as a leading industrial power. The Republican Party remained politically dominant for that entire time. Socialism became all the rage in Europe but failed to gain a foothold in America.\u000a\u000aWith the Great Depression, however, that all changed. Americans quickly turned to Democrats, granting them enormous congressional majorities. Democrats, with some momentum from the tyranny of the status quo as Milton Friedman called it, remained politically dominant until the economically disastrous 1970s. Double digit inflation, unemployment, and interest rates then did them in.\u000a\u000aSo the American people turned to Reagan and Republicans in 1980, sweeping in a Republican majority in the Senate and a president with a fresh perspective and credible plan for prosperity. At the time, many considered Reagan a political extremist. So the House Democratic majority remained as a potential check.\u000a\u000aThat continued until 1994, when the American people were confident enough in the Republican pro-growth perspective that Newt Gingrich could lead another political revolution, giving Republicans control over both houses of Congress for 12 years and breaking at long last the Democratic Great Depression chokehold on Congress.\u000a\u000aPeople forget that John McCain inched ahead of Obama in the polls for a short time, until the financial crisis took firm hold in late 2008. Because prosperity had already waned a bit under George W. Bush, this downturn convinced the American people to turn decisively to the Democrats that year, granting them huge congressional majorities.\u000a\u000aBut Obama and Democrats abused those majorities with Obamacare and all-time record federal deficits and debt. So in 2010, voters replaced the House Democratic majority with a decisive Republican majority, a 63-seat gain. Still, Democrats persisted in their anti-growth folly. So in 2014, voters did the same for the Senate.\u000a\u000aSince Democrats tend to believe what the mainstream media tell them, they don\u2019t know the American economy never fully recovered from the 2007-2009 recession. With Democrats promising still more of the same, even campaigning on throwing coal miners out of work, voters did what Democrats and their media thought unthinkable: They elected Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aDemocrats today have no idea how much trouble they are in, just like they didn\u2019t in 1980 when Reagan and the Republicans took over for a generation. If Republicans succeed in restoring economic growth, they will remain in power for another generation.\u000a\u000aThat growth would be sharply in prospect with the tax reform plans Republicans are considering, deregulation (especially of energy), budget cuts (Keynesian economics proved illogical), and stable dollar monetary policies.\u000a\u000aMost Democrats still don\u2019t know they are going to lose more Senate seats next year. Ryan\u2019s Republicans will likely handily retain their House majority.\u000a\u000aDemocrats also don\u2019t know that Bernie Sanders\u2019 openly socialist agenda is hopelessly outdated and has zero prospect of restoring growth. Worse, Barack Obama still vying for control of the party is only stylistically better.\u000a\u000aThis is no time for Democrats to be offering the American people soft socialism\u2014unless they want to be in what Reagan called the dustbin of history.\u000a\u000aPeter Ferrara is a Senior Fellow at the Heartland Institute, and a Senior Policy Advisor to the National Tax Limitation Foundation. He served in the White House Office of Policy Development under President Reagan and as Associate Deputy Attorney General of the United States under President George H.W. Bush.

aVMayor Bloomberg said he would \u201curge\u201d President Obama \u201cto clarify and reiterate his support for Israel. I feel very strongly about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter speaking at a Manhattan breakfast hosted by the Met Council on Jewish Poverty on Sunday, Bloomberg was asked by a reporter if he thought Obama might lose support among Jewish voters in the upcoming 2012 election.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Jews will look at what the president said and he\u2019s got to say \u2014 I\u2019m sure, between now and then,\u201d said Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aMany Democrats and Republicans here cringed when, on the eve of a visit from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Obama said Isarel should use their pre-1967 borders in peace talks with the Palestinians.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you talk to the experts,\u201d said Bloomberg, \u201cthe \u201967 borders is \u2014 been something that\u2019s used as a starting point in many other presidents\u2019 remarks. So, it\u2019s not necessarily fair to take this out of context. But, when Israel is particularly threatened \u2014 and there was an attack today, taken place as of a few minutes ago \u2014 it\u2019s particularly important that the president stand up\u201d and support Israel.\u000a\u000aBloomberg said the recent uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other counties, had reshuffled long-held calculations in that region.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe whole world is changing,\u201d he said. \u201c[The] Arab Spring is going to leave \u2014 all the assumptions of who is an ally of whom and who is protecting whom \u2014 up in the air. And we need the president to lead and he\u2019s got to be unequivocally clear. Israel is the only real democracy in the region.\u201d

aV\u201cI have to tell you my new favorite joke,\u201d Uzo Aduba says. \u201cI literally died laughing at it for half a day. You ready? Why did the chicken cross the road?\u201d\u000a\u000aI mumble something that probably sounds like, \u201cTo get to the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo get to the idiot\u2019s house,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cKnock knock.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chicken.\u201d And with that, Aduba descends into laughter. She insists the joke works better in print, but I\u2019ll contest it works pretty well when it\u2019s delivered by a two-time Emmy winner.\u000a\u000aAduba catapulted into mainstream recognition for her tender portrayal of Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren on Netflix\u2019s hit original series, Orange Is the New Black. In 2014, she won her first Emmy in 2014 for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. A year later, she won a second time\u2014best supporting actress in a drama\u2014making her the only actress to win awards in two different categories for the same role.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to me because I don\u2019t know if I believe we were ever one thing exclusively,\u201d Aduba says, about the Netflix show\u2019s category jumping. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the word is that needs to be created to call it, since we\u2019re so hell-bent as a society to find a category. We\u2019re very invested in placing things in certain boxes, for our own outside comfort, so we can say, \u2018I understand that you are this religion, that you are this gender, that you are this sexual orientation, that you are this sort of director, that this is this sort of show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aFrom its first season, Orange Is the New Black was a show that defied television convention. For one, it was a show that focused almost exclusively on women\u2019s stories, showcasing narratives about power and fear in a world in which male attention was an almost useless currency. It\u2019s also one of the most diverse shows on television\u2014one of the first to showcase a transgender actress portraying a transgender woman, and, as Aduba brings up, one of the only shows that depicts a variety of racial experiences across a number of different races.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs many shows are there are on television that are diverse, now, we still don\u2019t see a lot of television where we see a swath of different characters on a single show,\u201d Aduba says. There\u2019s Orange Is the New Black, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Master of None, Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, \u201cand not many more. We still haven\u2019t rounded that corner. It\u2019s not just enough to have different faces speaking for different groups but different faces all within the same group, speaking to all people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo character in Orange Is the New Black is the \u201ctoken\u201d minority: a character who pops up to offer an opinion on behalf of his or her entire race, whose main purpose in the narrative is offering guidance to the white protagonist and offering comfort to the viewers at home that they aren\u2019t racist.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are people who think this isn\u2019t for them because they\u2019re not a woman, or because they\u2019ve never been to prison, or they see people of color and think it\u2019s not for them. On the side of gender, people are realizing gender has nothing to do with it. You tell an honest story, an honest story lives inside of all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat love of storytelling was what brought Aduba from her path of becoming a classical opera singer to becoming an actress.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn high school, I knew I liked to sing, and my voice happened to sing in a classical fashion, so that seemed like the most sensible thing to do next. But when I went to school, I realized what I loved about singing was the storytelling aspect. Boston College has a classical program, so in the morning I\u2019d be rolling on the floor for movement, and we had to take acting and Shakespeare for the theatrical component, and then the afternoon we did the musical component\u2014musical theory, music history, and I was like, I think I like the rolling on the floor part more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you go into college, you\u2019re in this period in your life where you have so much certainty and uncertainty at the same time. You\u2019re so sure of some things, like, who you think you are and the person you want to be, and then going to school can either cement that for you and confirm, or, for a lot of people, I think it winds up breaking you wide open and making you realize your true identity and that\u2019s what happened with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as she shifted her career goals, Aduba\u2019s classical singing training formed the foundation of what would become her disciplined approach to the craft of acting. \u201cOpera is not something you just get up and do. It takes a discipline, a study, a vocal dexterity that is achieved through the exercise of the voice, and I think that\u2019s applicable to acting. I think how I approach my acting is not just to wake up and do it, although there are some things that can be found in just waking up and doing things, but if I\u2019m working on material, to really study it, and really get inside the head and the psychology of that individual and the world in which he or she inhabits. I had this amazing teacher in college who said, \u2018Anyone can sing pretty, but what are you trying to say?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so what has Aduba been trying to say with the character of Suzanne, who entered the series as comic relief, Piper\u2019s unrequited lover and who, over the course of four seasons, has become one of television\u2019s most heartbreakingly tragic figures, manipulated by those around her and desperate to be seen?\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody deserves love,\u201d Aduba says without hesitation.\u000a\u000aSuzanne Warren is just one of the many characters Orange Is the New Black has developed and enriched over the span of its four seasons. It\u2019s not character growth so much as character deepening, like seeing a two-dimensional shape and then walking around and realizing it was a three-dimensional sculpture all along. Through flashbacks, Orange Is the New Black peels back the khaki uniform and allows us to see prisoners\u2014so often dismissed in red-wine swirling living room political discussions as a monolith\u2014as individuals, each sheltering their own stories.\u000a\u000aAlthough its category at the Emmys has transferred from comedy to drama, that seems something of an arbitrary judgment call and not a shift in the show itself. The first season did have sad-sack Larry, Piper\u2019s infuriating milquetoast liberal stereotype of a fianc, but it still looked unflinchingly at drug abuse, the struggles of being transgender, the cruel caprices of the corrections officers and the day-to-day Kafkaesque nightmare that is American incarceration.\u000a\u000aThe later seasons didn\u2019t have Larry (thank god), but it focused on the same issues, still unflinching, even as they brought us to their heightened, tragic breaking point.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the first season, Season 4, where I have not watched the end,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cWhen the season came out, that experience was still very emotionally alive for me and I didn\u2019t want to have that experience right then again, because I remember, very clearly, second for second, what each of those last three episodes felt like\u2014and that feeling was so visceral, still, a year and however long away from it, and I was like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to watch that. I still haven\u2019t watched it. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be ready. Or if I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most difficult aspect of watching Orange Is the New Black might be the realization that it could be any one of us behind bars, without rights and seemingly without oversight, even if you think you\u2019re the type of person who would never, ever go to prison. While that lesson might have been most obvious right away with Piper, the privileged upper-middle-class blonde who got caught up 10 years ago with a drug-smuggling lover, it\u2019s true of almost every single character in the series.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood people can make mistakes,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cSetting it a min security prison, you realize with most of these characters, how they got there was a minor infection\u2014slipped on a banana peel and did something that they happened to get caught for it and you didn\u2019t. And I think that does a great way of humanizing these characters because they\u2019re not so far out of reach for most people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Aduba, she\u2019s grateful for the chance to be a part of it, to get to tell a good, honest story. \u201cThis is a gift, to get to do what I want to do. I can still remember waiting in lines, whether it was for an audition before I was union, and having to wait outside the union line, waiting for all of the union people to audition and then they would let the union people in, to stuffing envelopes, to stuffing envelopes with headshots and writing letters with my resume and dropping them off all over this city.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd now, this city is where Aduba is putting down roots. As she came to the interview, she was just finalizing buying a house to live in with her dog, Mr. Fenway Bark. \u201cI\u2019m just really happy,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cI\u2019m like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into The Woods lyric, \u2018Excited and scared.\u2019 That\u2019s what I am.\u201d

aVFor many hair colorists, the fall season can be stressful. There\u2019s often a lot of pressure to revive clients\u2019 hair, darken its color and immediately help with other issues that occurred over the summer from heat, salt, sun and chlorine exposure. It\u2019s very common for people to come in with dry, brittle strands that are stripped of the tonal qualities needed for color to radiate.\u000a\u000aOver the past several years fall color trends have been fun and different. Unicorn colors like pastels, rainbow variations and rose gold have been a big hit, and in turn, colorists have been given a lot more creativity. However, dusty tones like these are only achieved when the color absorbs into the hair shaft, which means that extreme bleaching is needed to achieve some of these looks.\u000a\u000aFor the fall season, bleaching to a lighter shade might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it\u2019s actually been a trend for years. The great Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and even Linda Evangelista, have all plunged into the lightening blue powder to achieve that one and only iconic tone known as Platinum. Today, Katy Perry is this look\u2019s hot new devotee. One has to wonder, though, if Katy\u2019s frequent and drastic color changes are ultimately for her new cropped do\u2014was it really by choice or by necessity?\u000a\u000aA platinum look this time of year can seem unexpected and exciting, but keep in mind the color can create catastrophic hair health dilemmas when it isn\u2019t done well, by an expert. That\u2019s why you do see many people opt for a cropped haircut when they go very light. Dried, frazzled ends and breakage become much more common.\u000a\u000aAs for general color care and upkeep, treatment products including Olaplex, Smartbond by L\u2019Oreal and pH-Bonder by Redken are just a few bond building products, meant to keep hair healthy as you lighten shades. Increasing the elasticity of the hair\u2019s shaft during more dangerous chemical procedures, like intensive hair bleaching and coloring, reduces the problems that can occur down the road. I find these products also provide a much needed safety net for the lazy colorists who can\u2019t resist overlapping when applying balayage or highlights to hair. Your salon will charge you more for these treatments at your color appointment, but they\u2019re highly recommended\u2014and worth it. I\u2019ll only use Olaplex when I\u2019m 100 percent sure of what other color treatments have been applied to a client\u2019s hair. I\u2019ve learned Olaplex doesn\u2019t work with any color that contains metallic elements. Be truthful with your stylist if it\u2019s your first time seeing him or her, and remember that what you do at home could possibly end up costing you much, much more to fix with professionals.\u000a\u000aAnother important thing to keep in mind is that we really cannot color hair better than nature can. A great example of this is the popularity of ombre. It makes sense to make hair ends lighter than the roots because the ends of strands are older and have been exposed to the elements longer, allowing the sun to work its magic. Everyone looks good in ombre when it is done right.\u000a\u000aWhen thinking about your perfect fall color transition, it goes without saying that your career and age should be considered. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have fun though, and if you\u2019re not afraid to cut your hair you\u2019ll be able to experiment a little more. I recommend a color consultation for anyone ready to make a change\u2014either small or drastic. Bring in a few pictures of yourself from a time when you loved your hair color, or find one of someone else for inspiration. A skilled colorist will be able to take into account your skin tone, eyes and lifestyle, and together you can develop a plan. All color requires a certain amount of care and upkeep. At a consultation I\u2019ll tell people to avoid too much sun, salt and aggressive shampoos containing sulfates and parabens. Lots of conditioning and cold rinses can always help keep color, too.\u000a\u000aFor men, it is rare that I ever take away all of the grays with my male clients, and there are colors I strongly suggest guys avoid. To start, my biggest nightmare would be a hue resembling Donald Trump\u2019s. Low lighting is the best way to infuse a natural tone back when grey has really taken over. For the younger men, a surfer look with a little balayage is the perfect way to achieve this. Red tones on men just don\u2019t work. Most of the time it makes their skin look blotchy and just screams dye job. I also stay away from and don\u2019t advise coloring methods like Just For Men. Things like this swap your grey out with a translucent weird hue that I find never ever looks real.\u000a\u000aThis particular season I am seeing the pastel shades increasing in their pigment\u2014becoming richer and bolder. Expect a lot of chestnut hair for fall, and long layered shaggy looks on the runway. This look is great for lighter skin tones.\u000a\u000aChocolate tones are all the rage for brunettes right now. Remember the root is darker but the ends are still chocolate, not gold, and definitely not darker brown. Try this on a below-the-chin choppy bob, and don\u2019t forget to add a long bang. Smolder your eye shadow, and definitely add a camel coat to your fall wardrobe lineup.\u000a\u000aBlondes are definitely less harsh this season, and not quite so ashy as the recent violet colors being added were making them. Think amber\u2014not the orange color, but that sort-of tiger-eye vein that runs through it. I think this will be the toner that lots of colorists will be mixing. Women will be wearing it with a deep-blue, slightly brighter than navy, and their brow will be darker and warmer than their hair.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of violet, I think we\u2019ll see a trend for natural ebony hair will add flecks of a dark purple. Berets will be a rage this year and will look fantastic with this look.\u000a\u000aMaybe none of these trends and ideas are for you; maybe you just want to keep it simple. Right now is a great time of year to deepen, enrich, and restore your hair.\u000a\u000aPaul Labrecque founded his salon and spa 1988 with a simple passion for beauty and fashion. What started as a two seat boutique salon on the Upper West Side has grown to three highly successful full service salons and spas in Manhattan, one location in downtown Philadelphia, an award-winning line of hair care products, a thriving retail and e-commerce business and a highly regarded education center for young stylists in training.

Be sure to tag the media outlet and handles of any interviewers in all tweets and Facebook posts mentioning the show. This will show the outlet that you are socially engaged and interested in getting eyes on their network.\u000a\u000a3. Search for brand mentions. If you want to see what everyone is saying about you on Twitter after the appearance, search all tweets, mentions about the show, mentions with your handle, and any related replies. Sometimes people will post their thoughts on the segment with the handle of the show, without mentioning your handle. If you are a frequent on-air personality, you may want to purchase a monitoring app, such as Mention, which will aggregate all of the social mentions for you. You can also set up a Google Alert for your name to get real time updates.\u000a\u000a4. Post behind-the-scenes moments. Fans and followers want more than what they see on television, so while you are in the green room, tweet a photo or post a video of the studio set on your Instagram story. If there are other guests in the room, take photos and share them on Snapchat.\u000a\u000a5. Create a graphic. Leading up to your appearance, create a compelling graphic to let fans know you\u2019ll be appearing on-air. Relevant details should include the time, date, show name and station channel. This is a great way to let all of your Facebook friends and Instagram followers know about your upcoming appearance. Be sure to tag the show\u2019s handles in the graphic after you post it. Brownie points for a \u201ccheck in\u201d at the studio the day of the appearance.\u000a\u000a6. Ask questions. Questions require answers, which can lead to direct interaction and engagement. Leading up to the appearance, ask fans their opinion on the topic you will be discussing to create two-way dialogue. After the show, ask your followers about their opinions on the segment. \u201cWhat did you think of the appearance?\u201d \u201cDo you agree that this bill should be passed?\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Strategically hashtag. If your appearance is on a hot news item, be sure to include the hashtags that are trending on Twitter as they pertain to your segment. Sometimes variations of a hashtag will be used to discuss a news story, so be sure to search by volume to see which hashtag has been used more.\u000a\u000a8. Tag brands. Part of a TV appearance includes wardrobe coordination, so be sure to leverage this for extra social media mileage. Look up the handles of the brands you will be wearing and direct message them prior to the appearance to let them know. Most likely, they will favorite the tweet or even retweet it.\u000a\u000a9. Think before responding. Social media builds relationships with your audience, but one negative response to an angry fan can ruin it. Stay positive and be aware of what you are posting. If something goes wrong, try to take a digital detox. For example, if your segment offended a core part of your audience, think carefully before responding. Remember, there are many layers that go into a successful television appearance.\u000a\u000a10. Don\u2019t engage with internet trolls. A core part of social media includes responding after you open up 2-way communication. However, getting involved with someone else\u2019s drama can be a big mistake. Not everyone will like your segment. In fact, assume at least ten people will hate it before you ever even tape it. Cyber bullies get a secret thrill out of regularly attacking just about anyone who appears on television. This comes with the territory.\u000a\u000aOnce the television appearance is over, continue tweeting links and clips, posting photos on Instagram Stories and promoting the clips from the green room. Post the appearance on your company website, and be sure to purchase a copy of the segment from a third party to upload it to YouTube. Do as much as you can to maximize the appearance. Remember, media likes other media, so the more you promote the appearances, the greater your likelihood is of getting asked back.

The brand\u2019s front rows were loaded with A-list celebs and received praise for providing snacks, such as popcorn and donuts, plus bottles of beer for each and every attendee. But much has changed since those days of yore\u2014for one, the brand is down one founder (David Neville stepped down from the company in 2016) and Marcus Wainwright has since taken the reins solo, as the CEO and creative director.\u000a\u000aHe has also opted to withhold the brand from New York Fashion Week this September.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor a while now I (along with what seems to be a lot of people!) have been questioning the effectiveness of the traditional fashion system, particularly for rag & bone. Coupled with everything that\u2019s going on in the world today, it felt somewhat tone deaf to do a runway show or throw a huge event,\u201d said Wainwright in a statement. \u201cSo while we are huge believers in NYFW, and in many ways have it to thank for so much, we are opting out of being on the calendar this season and instead are doing something that we feel is more relevant, impactful and meaningful.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe result is, indeed, impactful. The brand clearly took the resources they usually pour into a vast runway production and used it to create something that would not only present their cool and casual clothes, like plaid suits for girls and bomber jackets for boys, but actually give back to communities in need. The result is a lookbook, but not your average lookbook.\u000a\u000aThey cast a strong lineup of models (which is thankfully devoid of the usual Hadids and a Jenner), including Camilla Deterre, 69-year-old Maye Musk, Cameron Russell, Mayowa Nicholas and Laura Love. They also tapped a varying crew of celebs and influences, such as meme king Elliot Tebele (of the @fuckjerry Instagram account), Miami Dolphins defensive end Andre Branch, actors Paul Sparks and Bobby Cannavale, female surfer Quincy Davis, Olympic fencer Miles Chamley-Watson and Lauryn Hill\u2019s daughter, Selah Marley.\u000a\u000aThere was no famous fashion photographer tied to these images\u2014each of the stars snapped their own self portrait and was allowed creative freedom to do as they wish. For rapper Lil Buck, that included a mid-air jumping shot that looked like an extremely complicated feat. The stars also weren\u2019t paid for the shoot, but were instead asked to donate to a charitable function of their choice. Some picked Oceana, a non-profit aimed at saving the oceans, while others picked the Lupus Foundation of America. Others, of course, sent their funds directly to The American Red Cross and the Houston Humane Society, to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aFinally, it seems someone in fashion has figured out a way to flip the script on fashion week\u2014serving up good fashion, helping the world at large and doing something entirely unexpected.

aV\u201cCome for a day, stay for a week,\u201d reads the tourism website of Cold Spring, New York. That\u2019s a fine slogan, but it did not, alas, apply to our intrepid contestants on Bravo\u2019s Work of Art: The Next Great Artist this week, who were destined to hop a train from Grand Central for a brief, nervous jaunt up and down the town\u2019s Main Street, during which time they marveled at how picturesque (read: creepy) everything was and how weird the locals were, before fleeing back to the (much less weird and creepy) world of reality television.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe name makes it sound like it has something to do with spa treatments,\u201d contestant Young Sun Han murmured rapturously, as if he\u2019d just discovered a Shangri-La for TV\u2019s gay stereotypes. (Look, there\u2019s village councilman Sean Hayes!)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe further we get away from the city the more it looks like home to me,\u201d Dusty meanwhile drawled sweetly. We\u2019ve ridden Metro North\u2019s Hudson Line, and the back lots of New England mini malls do not particularly resemble Arkansas\u2019s amber waves of grain, in our humble opinion.\u000a\u000a\u201cWelcome to the quaint town of Cold Spring, New York,\u201d says show hostess/rich person China Chow, looking like a Strangers on a Train murderess in a big trench coat. Two people were going to get the boot, we learned. But, \u201cIf you survive this challenge you will be competing for the grand prize,\u201d Ms. Chow threatened. Survive this challenge? Is that what they\u2019ve been doing with the eliminated contestants? The challenge, if you\u2019re interested, was to take $200 and find a way to create a portrait of a verifiable, salt of the Thornton Wilder-ian earth Cold Spring resident.\u000a\u000aKYMIA NAWABI\u000a\u000a\u201cI have laryngitis today,\u201d rasps the first quaint resident that Ms. Nawabi hassled. But fear not, for Bob and Barbara, owners of some kind of haunted tchochke shop, rise to the occasion, proving themselves to be part charming Stars Hollow, part \u201call work and no play.\u201d In Ms. Nawabi\u2019s terms, they\u2019re a solid blend of \u201cweirdness and also sweetness.\u201d The couple, we learn, has \u201calways loved dolls.\u201d So Ms. Nawabi makes a kind of dark, demonic Norman Rockwell painting of the duo, portraying them as ice skaters in front of scary antique miscellany\u2014they skated on their first date. \u201cThe only non-conventional thing is that they\u2019re going to have several arms,\u201d artist mentor/auctioneer Simon de Pury frets of Ms. Nawabi\u2019s painting. Which is funny, because when he gesticulates, he looks like a stop-motion photograph of a pitcher. \u201cGet some weirdness in it,\u201d he cautions.\u000a\u000aYOUNG SUN HAN\u000a\u000aMr. Han makes a beeline to the nearest bed and breakfast, to inquire about spa treatments and also \u201ctown secrets,\u201d because he\u2019s clearly been watching The Witches of Eastwick, and believes the two go hand in hand. While he gets a guided tour of the inn\u2019s nine rooms, variously furnished with Jacuzzis and wood-burning fireplaces he is left scrambling, at the very last moment, for a subject. Luckily, he pinpoints the next great artist of Cold Spring at the Terence Donovan gallery\u2014namely, jolly Mr. Donovan himself, whom Mr. Han pays $200 for a 20-minute portrait. And guess what? Terence\u2019s portrait is really nice\u2014it\u2019s got a little Karen Kilimnik, or even Elizabeth Peyton in its saucy yet tender broad-stroked depiction of its young male subject. (\u201cYou have kind of Justin Bieber-ish hair,\u201d Terence says, which is totally something we can imagine Ms. Peyton saying to any of her sweetly puckish subjects.) In the gallery, Mr. Han leans Terence\u2019s painting against a wall, behind wooden planks plastered with extreme-close-up photographs of Terence that he took of the artist while he worked.\u000a\u000aLOLA THOMPSON\u000a\u000aHaving been soundly rejected by the town motorcycle guy, Ms. Thompson seeks out the men who are next on the list of people most likely to succumb to her witchy ways and nymphette wiles. Dennis and Tommy, rare-coin-collecting gentlemen, succumb to her flirtation, handing over a 1928 five-dollar bill to her. Ms. Thompson then prepares a multi-faceted, mostly non-figurative portrait/tribute to the two collectors, featuring a letter she wrote to them, which begins, \u201cDear Dennis and Tommy, You are the secret historians of Cold Spring\u201d (or maybe not so secret\u2026). There\u2019s also some tinfoil, and a pyramid of blown-up images of historic bills, and some other things on a shelf.\u000a\u000aDUSTY MITCHELL\u000a\u000aMr. Mitchell shyly settles on a little girl as his subject. She likes candy\u2014\u201call kinds!\u201d\u2014 and reminds the contestant of his daughter Cora, whom he abandoned in her infancy to go off to (an art-reality-TV) battle, and who, when this episode was filmed, had just turned one the previous day. Mr. Mitchell decides to make a mosaic of his young subject\u2019s face from M&Ms. Mr. de Pury\u2014who, in his most hilarious joke of season two, says he wants to \u201ccome to AR-Kansas\u201d\u2014briefly convinces Mr. Mitchell to work on a portrait made from folded-paper fortune-tellers, before the contestant runs out of time and returns to his candy idea. By that point, however, it\u2019s too late for the glue to dry, so M&Ms keep falling off it. Mr. Mitchell hopes that everyone will find this decomposition \u201cinteresting.\u201d\u000a\u000aSARA JIMENEZ\u000a\u000aBecause she always seems wryly uninterested in everything around her, Ms. Jimenez drives away her first potential subject, before finding friends among the local firemen. One older firefighter, Jackie, is of particular interest to Ms. Jimenez. He\u2019s battled blazes for 58 years, thereby inspiring a quite charming backlit portrait made from aluminum (which weirdly kind of resembles Mao) paired with an uninspiring dangly sculpture of aluminum and charcoal nameplates, one for every year Jackie served.\u000a\u000aTHE CRITIQUE\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s guest judge is pop-star portraitist Richard Phillips, who, for the record, is much taller than critic/judge Jerry Saltz and Ms. Chow, even in her crazy-tall heels, but maybe not taller than gallerist/judge Bill Powers\u2019 hair. The local portrait subjects show up for the gallery showing, and luckily enough, none of them are perceptibly offended by their variously unflattering, candy-coated, epistolary and so forth depictions.\u000a\u000aWINNER\u000a\u000aKymia Nawabi wins the first slot on the final episode for her cartoonish portrait because, as Ms. Chow says of Bob and Barbara, \u201cI met them and they\u2019re cartoons!\u201d That\u2019s not very nice, we think, and neither is Mr. Phillips\u2019 comment on the piece: \u201cAt first I was throwing up inside.\u201d But apparently none of that matters when you\u2019re in the final trio of possible next great artists.\u000a\u000aALSO HEADED TO THE FINALE\u000a\u000aYoung Sun Han, who we think should probably be facing an intellectual-property/copyright suit from Terence right about now, slinks by, even though the judges point out that he should have just shown Terence\u2019s painting. (Weird how the next great artist is not even a contestant on this show\u2026 Team Terence!) Sara Jimenez, meanwhile, also will compete in the final episode, mostly because Mr. Saltz is so proud that his little charge worked outside of her \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d Personally, we\u2019re freaked out that she referred to her portrait of Jackie (who\u2019s alive and thriving) as a \u201cmemorial.\u201d\u000a\u000aGOING HOME\u000a\u000aDusty Mitchell is at last taking that long covered-wagon ride back to Arkansas, mostly because too many of his artworks were literally paint-by-numbers pieces. And Lola Thompson will hop Al Pacino\u2019s jet back to Los Angeles because Ms. Chow doesn\u2019t understand why the currency pyramid counts as a portrait (odd, since Ms. Chow resembles money). Also, it\u2019s too scattered in its abstraction for the rest of the judges. And there is much crying.

It\u2019s a wave we noted last year. But over the last 12 months, the blurred lines have continued transforming the business in ways that are surprising even industry veterans. \u201cClients aren\u2019t choosing specializations anymore,\u201d said Salzman, whose company now brings in just a third of revenue from conventional media relations. \u201cThey\u2019re choosing people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNelson Fernandez, North American chairman of APCO Worldwide and its managing director in New York, agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a convergence between PR, advertising and digital. It\u2019s channel-agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who understands how to get inside people\u2019s heads. We\u2019re the ones who can read trends in how people are connecting, behaving and communicating. And if we keep doing that, I think we\u2019ll continue to be a very important\u2014perhaps the most important\u2014part of the marketing mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgencies are even moving away from describing themselves as PR firms. \u201cWe are content providers and distributors. Media relations no longer defines what we do,\u201d said Florence Quinn, founder of Quinn, the travel and lifestyle powerhouse. \u201cWe create strong ideas that resonate with people and the media. This is incredibly exciting because there are a gajillion ways to produce content and even more ways to distribute it. The line between earned and paid media has been crossed forever; there is no going back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt firms like Sunshine Sachs, whose clients range from A-list celebs (Lin-Manuel Miranda to blue-chip nonprofits (Human Rights Campaign) to corporations like Facebook, the transformation\u2019s been even more radical. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 35 people who don\u2019t do traditional communications,\u201d said Shawn Sachs, the firm\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant for a firm with about 160 people. We hired our second art director this year. If you\u2019d said that 10 years ago, people would have thought you were crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the broadest sense, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re a communications company. But we\u2019re also an advertising company, a marketing company, a digital company, an events company, an idea company. We\u2019re a lot of things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe upheaval in media has also transformed what clients need, said Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of entertainment and marketing giant PMK*BNC\u2014and agencies like hers have benefited.\u000a\u000a\u201cSharing and providing content\u2014that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Berger said. \u201cOur ability is to really craft a narrative for a specific client, pursue media for that client, work with influencers and generate partnerships, whether they\u2019re brand related or fan-related. Fans are partners too. Our job is to make sure fans download the book, buy the record or use a provider we\u2019re working with.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t give up on traditional PR just yet, said Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick, where more than two-thirds of growth is coming from digital, social and content-marketing arm Mediaco. \u201cWe call ourselves an engagement firm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, it\u2019s a mistake to decide you\u2019re no longer in the public relations business. If you think about changes in the media world, and the impact earned media still has, PR continues to be absolutely critical. Sure, we\u2019ve evolved as a firm. But we\u2019re proud of our heritage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd while creative destruction hasn\u2019t been great for media, it\u2019s keeping PR mavens buoyantly optimistic (and well compensated\u2014according to The Holmes Report, the global PR industry grossed $14.2 billion in 2015).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in the message business,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cAnd our business is as exciting and interesting as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: New York\u2019s Top Specialty PR Agencies\u000a\u000aA word about the PR Power 50 list:\u000a\u000aRather than rely on revenue or size as criteria for our rankings, the Observer considers subjective factors. What kind of year did a firm have? Did it hire superstars? Has it won covetable clients? Does it feel like the agency\u2019s got momentum and juice? Did it avoid serious screw-ups\u2014or at least keep its screw-ups out of view?
