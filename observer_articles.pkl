VDavid Letterman hosted the Late Show for a whopping 22 years before retiring in 2015. When you do something so well for that long, it can be difficult to just ride off into the sunset without ever returning. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that Letterman is making his way back to television with a newly formatted talk show on Netflix.\u000a\u000aAccording to TheWrap, the untitled six-episode series will feature the longtime host \u201ccombining in-depth conversations with field pieces. In each hour-long episode, Letterman will conduct a long-form interview with a singular guest\u201d and also \u201cexplore some topics on his own, away from the studio.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt sounds like an interesting new twist on your standard talk show. But of course Letterman would want to spice things up a bit after a couple decades behind the desk.\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel excited and lucky to be working on this project for Netflix,\u201d Letterman said via TheWrap. \u201cHere\u2019s what I have learned, if you retire to spend more time with your family, check with your family first. Thanks for watching, drive safely.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJust meeting David Letterman was a thrill; imagine how exciting it is for me to announce that we will be working together,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos said. \u201cDavid Letterman is a true television icon, and I can\u2019t wait to see him out in the wild, out from behind the desk and interviewing the people he finds most interesting. We\u2019ll have to see if he keeps the beard.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe know our vote doesn\u2019t count for anything, but please keep the I\u2019ve-been-lost-in-the-wilderness-for-three-months beard, David.\u000a\u000adavid letterman looks like a baby who's taking a bath and made a beard out of the bubbles pic.twitter.com/YeSp2ipNjW \u2014 it's lambtime, binch (@julp) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe new series is set to premiere in 2018.

aVLast week, HBO was dealt a serious blow when hackers released a handful of scripts and unaired episodes of current original series. Last night, the cyber attackers released a second wave of stolen data that included Game of Thrones scripts and a ransom note. Until now, the group\u2019s motivation had been unclear.\u000a\u000aThe hackers claim to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data, roughly seven times more than the Sony hack. All of the documents they released were watermarked with the hackers\u2019 motto, \u201cHBO is Falling,\u201d according to Wired. In addition to episode scripts, the anonymous group also released internal documents from HBO, emails, financial information, employment agreements and marketing documents. Also included in the cache is a month\u2019s worth of email from HBO\u2019s vice president for film programming, Leslie Cohen.\u000a\u000aIn a video letter set to the Game of Thrones theme song, the hackers demanded a ransom (redacted from the published version of the letter) from HBO CEO Richard Plepler or else they would continue to leak information.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur demand is clear and Non-Negotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your data,\u201d the letter read, according to Wired. USA Today reported that the hackers implied their demand was at least $6 million and that they wanted it paid in bitcoin installments. \u201cHBO spends 12 million for Market Research and 5 million for GOT7 advertisements. So consider us another budget for your advertisements!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe note was signed by \u201cMr. Smith,\u201d who set a deadline for the ransom of three days, according to the outlet. The hackers went on to threaten that \u201cLeakage will be your worst nightmare. So make a wise decision!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe massive hack began last week when the group stole a trove of data, and Plepler sent a companywide email to his employees notifying them of the cybersecurity breach. The FBI and other cybersecurity authorities quickly became involved as the network worried that emails and customer information had been compromised as well. Executives did admit that the hackers had gained access to \u201cproprietary information,\u201d though it remains to be seen how extensive the hack is.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident,\u201d HBO spokesperson Jeff Cusson told Wired. He did not address the hackers\u2019 ransom demand.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Smith\u201d and his group added a detailed plot summary of next week\u2019s Game of Thrones episode along with photos from the show. They also hinted that they possess unaired episodes of Room 104, Insecure, Curb Your Enthusiasm and a new show from Silicon Valley creator Mike Judge.\u000a\u000aThough they are demanding financial compensation, the hackers insist that they\u2019re actually \u201cwhite hats\u201d and not criminals, according to Wired. \u201cIt\u2019s a game for us. Money isn\u2019t our main purpose,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to endanger HBO\u2019s situation nor cause it to lose its reputation. We want to be your partner in a tiny part of HBO\u2019s huge income.\u201d

aVHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has reportedly raised $25.9 million in 2017 through hosting 124 lavish fundraising galas across the country to boost the campaign coffers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Herein lies the primary reason she has kept her leadership position despite her unpopularity with voters and even her own colleagues, who have lost faith in her ability to lead. In a recent survey of 20 House Democratic candidates, only one would vocally support Pelosi. This survey comes just weeks after several congressmen spoke out about the need for leadership change. \u201cPresident Putin probably has a better approval rating in Georgia than Nancy Pelosi,\u201d said David Kim, a candidate in Georgia\u2019s Seventh Congressional District, in an interview with McClatchyDC.\u000a\u000aSince the 2016 election, Pelosi has made several gaffes and contradicted the Democratic Party\u2019s messaging as she fights to preserve the party establishment\u2019s status quo.\u000a\u000aIn December 2016, she reduced calls for reform by saying in an interview, \u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats want a new direction.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring a CNN town hall in February 2017, she condescendingly told a millennial who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, \u201cWe\u2019re capitalists, that\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d in response to a question about why Democrats don\u2019t embrace Sanders\u2019 policies. She went on to explain that Democrats should strive for compassionate capitalism.\u000a\u000aAfter Georgia special congressional election candidate Jon Ossoff lost partially due to Republicans aligning him with Pelosi, several Democrats began speaking out about the need for change in party leadership. Pelosi\u2019s abrasiveness toward progressives and Sanders supporters inspired a primary challenger, Stephen Jaffe, to face her in the 2018 Democratic primaries.\u000a\u000aRecently, Pelosi\u2019s obliviousness to the party\u2019s problems have been even more apparent than usual. She essentially reduced the Democrats\u2019 new platform and Better Deal slogan to a marketing campaign when she said the change is \u201cnot a course correction but a presentation correction.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn July 30, she told Fox News that she is \u201ca master legislator.\u201d Her actions and rhetoric demonstrate that she favors maintaining her own political power and that of the Democratic establishment over entertaining the possibility that her poor leadership has been poisoning the party. \u201cWe have unity in our own party. You saw it with the fight on the Affordable Care Act in the House and in the Senate,\u201d Pelosi insisted.\u000a\u000aThe only unity Pelosi has been able to achieve is with the party\u2019s donors. In November 2016, she attended a closed door conference with donors to perform an autopsy of the 2016 election. In 2017, she has used her super PAC, the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund, to raise money for herself and the DCCC. The fund is similar in structure to Hillary Clinton\u2019s controversial Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with the DNC, which Politico reported was used to essentially launder money to the Clinton campaign. So far this year, about $1.2 million has passed through the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund. Another committee, Nancy Pelosi for Congress, has received over $1.2 million in campaign contributions in 2017. Her leadership PAC, called PAC to the Future, has received over $300,000 so far this year, including $2,500 from Blue Cross/Blue Shield\u2019s super PAC.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported that Pelosi racked up million-dollar fundraising hauls at \u201ca trio of \u2018Speaker\u2019s Cabinet\u2019 VIP events this year in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.\u201d Some of the top donors listed donations of $16,200 each via employees from the investment bank Moelis & Company, private venture capital firm Ambex Venture Partners, Regis Management Investment Advising Firm, Klein Financial, Francisco Partners Private Equity Firm and DFJ Venture Capital. Max contributors and Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund donors include DNC Treasurer William Derrough, lobbyist Michael Berman, oil tycoon heirs Gordon and Ann Getty, former Bill Clinton adviser Tom Werner, billionaire George Marcus and former White House Press Secretary under Obama and now Amazon Senior VP James Carney.\u000a\u000aThe fact that Nancy Pelosi, one of the top Democratic Party leaders, is courting donors in the same manner that has poisoned the Democratic Party\u2019s reputation confirms that Democrats have learned nothing from their losses. Instead of revamping the party through grassroots organizing and fundraising, Pelosi travels the country with billionaires and corporate executives. Nothing in the Democratic Party will ever change until politicians who prefers donors over voters are removed from leadership roles.

aVABC\u2019s Modern Family debuted in the fall of 2009 and all the show has done since then is become one of the highest-rated sitcoms on television while winning five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series. Though the quality has waned a bit in its later years, Modern Family remains a staple of ABC programming. But all good things must come to an end.\u000a\u000aIn May, ABC ordered two more seasons, which will take the show into season 10. Based on co-creator Steve Levitan\u2019s recent comments, it sounds as if that might be the time Modern Family finally cashes out.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur original goal was to just stay on the air,\u201d Levitan told Deadline. \u201cAfter awhile though, we felt we may be in control of our own fate, and 10 sounded like a nice round number.\u201d\u000a\u000aNegotiations for additional seasons were said to be long and arduous and since the main cast are banking upwards of $150,000 per episode, according to THR, ABC is probably ready to bring the series to a close as well. Continuing past season 10 would be a very expensive endeavor for the network.\u000a\u000aOn top of that, it\u2019s just difficult creatively to sustain quality over such a long span. Look at other long-running sitcoms like The Office or The Simpsons. Both shows saw noticeable downturns in later seasons and some have even argued it\u2019s time to put the latter out of its misery.\u000a\u000aLevitan said he\u2019s begun talking with producers and writers about how to wrap up the show, but that no definitive ending has been decided upon just yet.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe haven\u2019t had that exact conversation yet how we want to end the show episode-wise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about areas that we want to go and tonally what we want to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did have one inkling on how the series finale might look, however.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think we will end the show the way we started it in the pilot, with a big family event.\u201d

aVCobie Smulders wants to know where she can rent an RV.\u000a\u000aThe actress, best known for her work on How I Met Your Mother, is currently making her Broadway debut in a revival of Noel Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. But on a recent Monday morning the statuesque brunette was looking ahead to July, when her run ends and she, her husband (Saturday Night Live alum Taran Killam, who\u2019s currently starring in Hamilton) and their two children (ages 2 and 7) head back to California.\u000a\u000aSmulders wants to make the cross-country journey in a trailer, but she\u2019s at a loss for where to begin\u2014until one of her stylists recommends a dealership in Weehawken, New Jersey, at which point Smulders says she\u2019ll \u201cget on that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old is no stranger to long road trips. Early in her acting career, she made an annual pilgrimage from her home in Vancouver to Los Angeles to try her luck during TV pilot season (which runs from November to March). She and her Canuck cohorts referred to the trip as the \u201cCanadian migration.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d work in restaurants all year long to make money, and then blow it for three months in L.A. while we were trying to get jobs,\u201d Smulders told the Observer during an interview at the Musket Room, a barn stable turned high-end restaurant in lower Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSmulders participated in theater clubs throughout elementary and high school, and she also briefly moved to New York to pursue her craft\u2014that\u2019s where she saw Rent and first dreamed of being on Broadway.\u000a\u000aBut it was those trips to L.A. that bore the most fruit. Indeed, during Smulders\u2019 third pilot season she landed her breakout role as TV reporter Robin Scherbatsky on How I Met Your Mother. The CBS sitcom debuted in 2005 and ran for nine seasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was one of those magical things that just kept going,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aAmong the most magical parts of it (at least for Smulders) was that her character had a pop star alter ego named Robin Sparkles, whose hits included \u201cLet\u2019s Go to the Mall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of the major complaints for long-running shows is that they become mundane,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cI never felt that way because of stuff like Robin Sparkles.\u201d\u000a\u000aOutside this fantasy world, Robin was the on-again, off-again love interest of both Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Indeed, in the series finale, after the titular mother dies, Ted\u2019s kids convince him to give his relationship with Robin another shot (she and Barney have married and divorced by this point).\u000a\u000aMany fans were disappointed in the way the series wrapped up, and while Smulders disagrees she\u2019s glad that people had strong opinions about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople were really emotionally invested in this show,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful way to end the time we spent together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmulders\u2019 fan base expanded from comedy fans to comic book fanboys when she was cast as badass S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (and Samuel L. Jackson sidekick) Maria Hill in the Avengers franchise. She met Joss Whedon (director of the first two films) through her Mother co-star Alyson Hannigan.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe humans aren\u2019t as interesting to watch in a battle, but Joss is kind and makes sure every actor has a moment,\u201d said Smulders, who will appear in next summer\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War.\u000a\u000aShe also made waves earlier this year after a mysterious cameo on the Netflix show Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2014the series cut away from the main action several times to show Smulders and Will Arnett handcuffed in the back of a van and exploring Peru, among other adventures. The couple\u2019s entire storyline turned out to be a red herring.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy character didn\u2019t die, so I have no idea what they\u2019re gonna do next season,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs such, Smulders is refocusing on comedy while she stars in Present Laughter, which opens April 5 at the St. James Theatre. And it\u2019s clear her comedic instincts are still strong from her sitcom days\u2014at one point during the photo shoot for this article, she started nibbling on a chili pepper that was sitting on the bar, a sight to make even the most hardened cynic chuckle.\u000a\u000aWhile this is Smulders\u2019 first time on Broadway, she\u2019s been a fan of Coward since the beginning of her career\u2014she performed scenes from his classic Private Lives in acting classes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love the way he uses comedy as a weapon,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aThe main sharpshooter in Present Laughter is Garry Essendine (played by Oscar and Tony winner Kevin Kline), a celebrated, self-absorbed actor with a voracious libido who\u2019s going through a midlife crisis. Throughout the play he negotiates comic conflicts with his wife, producer, director, secretary and servants, among others.\u000a\u000aSmulders plays Joanna Lyppiatt, who\u2019s married to Garry\u2019s producer but is also infatuated with Garry himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all feel like we can help him in some way or save him in some way or make his life better in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all want to be with him, and we think we know him, so it\u2019s a bit of a game trying to get into the inner circle of this world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaying the game with a formidable opponent like Kline keeps Smulders on her toes\u2014she described him as an \u201cidiot savant\u201d who takes comedy seriously.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe keeps changing and keeping things interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s like water: so fluid, going from one thing to the next. He\u2019s a true artist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same traits apply to Smulders herself, according to Present Laughter director Moritz von Stuelpnagel (a Tony nominee for helming Hand to God).\u000a\u000a\u201cCobie was built for the theater,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cShe\u2019s thoughtful about storytelling and precise in her comedy. It\u2019s been a real joy to watch her take a character that might otherwise descend into a flat archetype and have her flesh the role out with dynamic humanity.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Coward\u2019s fast-paced writing style is similar to the patter on sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother, Smulders said sustaining that rhythm for almost three hours presented a new challenge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing in a 15 minute scene is unlike anything you have to do on film or TV,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Broadway grind of rehearsals and performances has also had an impact on Smulders\u2019 home life, especially since her spouse is in the same boat\u2014Killam is playing King George III in Hamilton through April 13.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously there\u2019s a little bit of a \u2018Who\u2019s getting up first to take care of the kids\u2019 type of situation,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cBut aside from the lack of sleep, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019re together in ways that we haven\u2019t been before.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe and Killam meet for dinner together on two show days. Smulders admitted she takes advantage of the fact that her future RV partner is in Broadway\u2019s biggest hit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s a part of it, and by association I feel like I\u2019m a part of it, but maybe that\u2019s just me being greedy,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGreed aside, Smulders said that her time in New York had been \u201ca dream\u201d thus far.\u000a\u000a\u201cI keep fooling people into giving me jobs, and now I\u2019m on Broadway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always something I\u2019ve wanted to be a part of, and I can\u2019t believe that this is the experience I\u2019m having.\u201d

aVAtop the stack of great books on my summer reading nightstand is Chris Whipple\u2019s The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency. It was a great read the first time around, and, given all that\u2019s transpired in the last couple weeks, I\u2019m reading it again.\u000a\u000aWhipple takes his readers inside the second most important job in the White House, showing how chiefs of staff are often the difference between success and disaster.\u000a\u000aIn his introduction, Whipple chronicles a December 2008 meeting in the West Wing, when all but two of the living chiefs of staff gathered in an unprecedented meeting to offer incoming Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel some advice.\u000a\u000aTheir words are especially compelling right now.\u000a\u000aKen Duberstein, who was Ronald Reagan\u2019s last chief of staff, reminded the incoming chief, \u201cAlways remember that when you open your mouth, it is not you but the president who is speaking.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlways tell him (POTUS) what he may not want to hear \u2013 because frankly, a lot of people in the White House will always tell the president what he wants to hear,\u201d advised Leon Panetta.\u000a\u000aJohn Podesta told him to \u201cslow down and listen.\u201d Finally Donald Rumsfeld delivered the clincher. \u201cYou are NOT indispensable.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn fact, the chief of staff has historically been a revolving-door-type position. The average tenure has only been about 18 months. However, all lasted longer than Reince Priebus who left just six months into the new administration.\u000a\u000aHis successor, retired Marine General and former Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, arrives at a critical time. The White House has been mired in internal squabbling and a stalled legislative agenda. His opportunity to restore discipline, maintain order and move the agenda will be an additional test of his leadership, a test he\u2019s consistently passed with flying colors.\u000a\u000aThe advice of one of the two men who couldn\u2019t attend that historic meeting in December 2008 may be the key. \u201cYou can focus on the \u2018Chief,\u2019 or you can focus on the \u2018of Staff,\u201d counseled James H. Baker, the only man to serve twice as chief of staff to two different presidents. \u201cThose who have focused on the \u2018of Staff\u2019 have done pretty well.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no question that John Kelly is an exemplary leader. You don\u2019t become a four-star general in the United States Marine Corps without demonstrating exceptional leadership ability every day.\u000a\u000aHis willingness to embrace Jim Baker\u2019s model of servant leadership and \u201cother-oriented\u201d management is already evident. It began with his obvious recognition that experience and expertise really do matter. He clearly believes that staffing the most powerful office of the world is an awesome responsibility to the nation and the leadership of the free world.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of Kelly taking his post, Anthony Scaramucci, whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director was highlighted by a vulgarity-ridden interview he believed was \u201coff the record,\u201d was gone.\u000a\u000aKelly had won his first battle. There are many more to come.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a goddamn difficult job in the best of circumstances,\u201d Jim Baker reminds us.\u000a\u000aThe principal challenges for Kelly will be restoring discipline, stemming the tide of leaks, developing a consistent and cohesive message, and making the Trump agenda a reality.\u000a\u000aRestoring a sense of teamwork and professionalism, essential to any organization, will flow from the servant-leadership model advocated by Jim Baker. When the focus is on the mission, rather than any individual, success is the far more likely result. Such focus curbs leaking, most of which is motivated by self-interest. It also allows for controlled access, as all understand that the chief of staff must be a true gatekeeper, controlling who sees the president and what goes into the Oval Office and flows from the White House.\u000a\u000aKelly made a vital first step in insisting that all White House staff report through him. Scaramucci was one of a couple of \u201cdirect reports\u201d to the president.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Kelly\u2019s ability to do his job depends on the man at whose pleasure he serves. If he\u2019s given full reign, General Kelly can aggressively move the president\u2019s agenda, even in the face of staunch external opposition.\u000a\u000aTed Sorensen, one of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s most trusted and closest advisors, once summed up the critical role of the chief of staff, \u201cAll of our presidents select for various positions cronies or political hangers-on or whatever. But every president knows when he\u2019s picking his chief of staff, by God, he\u2019d better get the right man in that job or he\u2019ll be ruined.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u200b\u000a\u000aIf John Kelly\u2019s first week on the job is any indication, Donald J. Trump certainly got the right man.\u000a\u000aCharlie Gerow is the CEO of Quantum Communications and Vice Chairman of the American Conservative Union.

aVFacebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg is inciting speculation that he is planning to run for president in 2020. Part of this speculation has stemmed from the political establishment\u2019s obsession with finding a \u201cnice\u201d billionaire to counter Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aIn December 2016, Zuckerberg renounced his atheism saying, \u201cReligion is very important.\u201d His tour around the country resembles a political campaign rife with awkward public relations stunts to try to convey that Zuckerberg can relate to average people. President Barack Obama\u2019s former photographer is traveling with him on the tour to take photos of him in action.\u000a\u000aI spent the afternoon with the Gant family on their farm in Blanchardville, Wisconsin.

Thanks to the Gants for being such gracious hosts. A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) on Apr 30, 2017 at 3:08pm PDT\u000a\u000aHe recently hired former Hillary Clinton adviser Joel Benenson, which incited further speculation that he is gearing up for a presidential bid. Though Benenson is reportedly working on Zuckerberg\u2019s philanthropic endeavors, bringing him on as an adviser distances progressives from Zuckerberg. Benenson claimed during the primaries that Sen. Bernie Sanders ran the \u201cmost negative\u201d primary campaign in history\u2014even though Sanders didn\u2019t run a single attack ad\u2014and said that Sanders needed to change his tone if Clinton was going to agree to more debates. Benenson ran one of the worst marketing campaigns in history for Olestra, a fat substitute with a variety of dangerous side effects.

A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) on Jun 23, 2017 at 5:01pm PDT\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Facebook announced that Zuckerberg could still run the company while serving in government. Though Zuckerberg has denied that he plans to run for president, his actions over the past few months have said otherwise.\u000a\u000aThe increasing power he yields through Facebook is alarming, making his political ambitions even more so. With an estimated net worth of $70.5 billion, Zuckerberg is the fifth richest person in the world. His wealth has grown as Facebook\u2019s imprint on the world has increased. The company has received a free pass when it comes to anti-trust laws, such as when it purchased WhatsApp without regulators blinking an eye. In the wake of the fake news controversy of the 2016 election, Facebook is becoming an arbiter of censorship of published content and information based on nothing but its own judgment.\u000a\u000aAt a time of gross wealth inequality, the last thing the world needs is another billionaire as president. However, establishment forces are hoping to cure voters apathy to politics by finding a more palatable billionaire to run the country.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg has made headlines for negative press. Earlier this year, three companies he owns filed a lawsuit against more than 300 Native Hawaiians with ancestral rights to land surrounding his Hawaii home so that he can make his home more secluded by kicking out the natives who live nearby. Facebook\u2019s cafeteria workers have recently begun advocating for higher wages because their low pay is not enough to afford living in Silicon Valley. The Guardian recently interviewed and profiled a couple who work in Facebook\u2019s cafeteria and live in a two-door car garage while struggling to make ends meet. In 2016, the government of Uganda ordered 63 private schools funded by Zuckerberg and Bill Gates to be shut down for falling below standards. Like Gates, Zuckerberg has pushed a pro-charter school agenda and funded the privatization of schools in line with Trump\u2019s Secretary of Education Betsy Devos\u2019 philosophy on education.\u000a\u000aFacebook has immense power over the daily lives of Americans. It remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg\u2019s public relations efforts are geared toward a political run or solely meant to boost Facebook\u2019s brand. Either way, it is wrong to believe that the correct antidote to Trump is an even more powerful billionaire.

aVSugar Sammy is a comedian, actor, writer and producer from Montreal. He tours internationally, in English, French, Punjabi and Hindi. He mainly performs stand-up comedy but boasts a large body of work, including three one-man shows, an original TV series on Canada\u2019s French V network and an HBO Canada special (the first of it\u2019s kind). He\u2019s performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal seven years in a row and in his four fluent languages. The Observer sat down with Sammy to discuss his impressive body of work and the unique style he\u2019s developed by performing in such diverse cultural landscapes. Sammy will be headlining Caroline\u2019s Comedy Club in New York City July 13, 14 and 15.\u000a\u000aYou were just in Austin, which leads me to my first question: I know you\u2019re on sort of a U.S. run right now, how\u2019s it been treating you?\u000a\u000aGreat, it\u2019s been fun to discover how different the U.S. is from state to state, from city to city, how different their points of view are, their politics, their demographics, religious beliefs, it changes depending on what area of the country you\u2019re in. You know, one of the things they say about America right now is that it\u2019s so divided. I mean, America is also so diverse in terms of its composition, but the diversity doesn\u2019t melt together. It\u2019s diversity by region, it\u2019s weird.\u000a\u000aYeah, it\u2019s kind of atomized in a weird way, especially right now, but it makes sense that you would notice that as someone who speaks four different languages, tours internationally and things like that. How do you find yourself adjusting your material when you travel?\u000a\u000aThe material is the same, what changes is the reactions. But a lot of times I\u2019m surprised, I was just in Naples, Florida, which is one of the highest populations of Trump voters. I was bringing my material there, coming from a Canadian perspective, and I was really surprised because these people were losing their minds laughing at this material where I was nervous going in there, I was like, \u201cI know it\u2019ll work in Seattle, I know it\u2019ll work in San Jose, I know it\u2019ll work in different places, but I was completely surprised by how well it worked there.\u000a\u000aDid you book Naples for that reason?\u000a\u000aI booked Naples because they wanted to book me. A lot of snowbirds\u2014a lot of Canadians\u2014go there for the winter, so they\u2019ve been bugging the comedy clubs to book me there. I was also insisting on doing it because I wanted to test the material democratically everywhere.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s one thing about road comics\u2014you don\u2019t get into bubbles a lot of the time. You\u2019re not just talking to your own people. Did a lot of Canadians come see you?\u000a\u000aA lot, but also social media gets a lot of people in. Also I used to tour the states, I used to headline the states a lot from around 2009 to 2011, whereas currently I\u2019m spending a lot of time in Canada and Europe, so I have a lot of fans here that it\u2019s been good to get back to, to say I\u2019m back.\u000a\u000aTell me about that. When you perform in France, and you perform in other languages, do you find that comedy works differently in other languages\u2014or is it more of a cultural thing?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s more of a cultural thing, that\u2019s so interesting, you\u2019re the first person that\u2019s asked that question. It\u2019s not a linguistic thing. Linguistically, you have to adjust a little bit in that you have to make sure you get to the punchline as quickly as possible, but the material stays the same and the structure stays the same, you just gotta find that bridge between the language and the way it works because it was constructed in English, but it works in other languages. I\u2019ve done it French, Hindi and Punjabi, and you just gotta find the cultural material that connects to that audience. Linguistically, if I had a French or Indian audience in New York, I\u2019d do the same material I do about the states, but I\u2019d do it in French, and it still works.\u000a\u000aA lot of people will say that with something like, let\u2019s say, hip-hop, that it only works in English style rhyme scheming or something.\u000a\u000aHip-hop is more beautiful in French! You gotta check out this rapper, he\u2019s a legend in France, he\u2019s called MC Solaar, in French his stuff flows better. And similarly France is now starting to have the stand up tradition. I think the difference was for years they\u2019d have these one-man shows where they\u2019d be doing characters and their mom and their uncle and stuff like that, like what you guys would call an Off-Broadway show or whatever, but in the last five years we\u2019ve seen these stand ups come out. And it\u2019s the art form that becomes the norm. Five years ago when they were doing these one man shows they\u2019d ask me, \u201cWould your material work there?\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople who\u2019ve done Edinburgh say it\u2019s like that a lot of the time. They\u2019d do these tight New York one-liners, and people just didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u000a\u000aYeah, but you just gotta do what you do best. You can break through with them a lot; that\u2019s the art form\u2014it\u2019s more conversational. And even if it\u2019s a cultural shock for a second, you can get through to them. It doesn\u2019t feel like this guy\u2019s just doing this schtick up there where he doesn\u2019t acknowledge us and he\u2019s just doing the same stuff every night. There\u2019s all these improvisational elements going on. It\u2019s a lot like jazz in that they\u2019d do five or six shows a weekend and record all of them and then pick the one they liked the best, because it\u2019s not gonna be the same show, it changes depending on the audience. And there\u2019s that dance with the audience that\u2019s the important part, they\u2019re listening to us as much as we\u2019re listening to them.\u000a\u000aYour material is very crowd-work heavy and that makes a lot of sense. Somebody once told me the audience is like an instrument and when you\u2019re doing crowd work you\u2019re like jamming, you know?\u000a\u000aYeah! That\u2019s so true.\u000a\u000aSo where\u2019d that style come from? I\u2019ve noticed with crowd work and people that are really good at it, they work in clubs a lot, like proper comedy clubs where the audience is people that are on dates as opposed to audiences in bars or what have you. You came up in Canada right?\u000a\u000aI came up in Canada but I toured everywhere, but I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of our headliners in Canada and England are really good at crowd work because we value the emcee role a lot, so what happens is, a lot of headliners, when they have a weekend off, they host. And it\u2019s valued and paid the same as headlining because it\u2019s treated like the most important role in that show, Whereas here it\u2019s different, the hierarchy and pay is different. In England it\u2019s always been a five-man show where there\u2019s four headliners doing 20 minutes apiece and an emcee, and everyone gets paid evenly, and you\u2019ll see headliners emcee very easily.\u000a\u000aSo did you do a lot of that?\u000a\u000aI did a lot of that, and so you develop that skill very easily, and I just find it becomes a very fun part of the show. I\u2019ll have my material but I like going and using the crowd and talking to them, who knows, something might happen, or I\u2019ll bounce ideas for a new bit off of them. And also, I\u2019ll tape every show and the best crowd work, I\u2019ll use that as promotional material, because you don\u2019t want to burn your actual material you know? It\u2019s not like music where they want to hear the same joke over and over. So it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving them a part of the show without burning any of the show.\u000a\u000aDo you find that when you travel, are you trying to bring what you do to those new places or are you adjusting to how they respond?\u000a\u000aI think a bit of both, I bring what I do, but I make it about them. Like you said about being an anthropologist, like when I go to France I notice these little tiny things that are commonplace for them and then I point them out and it becomes funny because they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right it\u2019s funny, but we never talk about it,\u201d but I also talk about myself and the Canadians point of view and how we\u2019re different. And you can\u2019t be a caricature, you can\u2019t do it from afar, you gotta be immersed in it. It\u2019s happening as I\u2019m in New York right now, I\u2019m noticing these things.\u000a\u000aHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been in New York?\u000a\u000aI was here last month, at the French Comedy Festival. I hosted one gala in English. It was all French comedians doing comedy in English for the first time and a few Americans, and then I played my show in French for a half-French crowd and a half-Québécois crowd, and I like that; I like it when I have to switch languages and switch cultures because it keeps your brain sharp\u2014you\u2019re always working, you\u2019re never on autopilot.\u000a\u000aYeah, you definitely have to keep yourself in the moment so you don\u2019t become a robot.\u000a\u000aYeah, and that\u2019s the danger, that\u2019s why I like the crowd work, and that\u2019s why I like moving around. You know, I was touring Quebec for five years, and I was having a great time, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was growing as a writer, as soon as I flew into France my writer brain went crazy. I would be up all night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019d be having to write all this stuff down. I feel like you have to get out of your comfort zone, which is why I like going to other countries so much.\u000a\u000aPeople say that about writer\u2019s block, that you have to shake things up, but then the question is always, How? That seems like a really good answer. Man, this is fun. I feel like I could pick your brain all day. We could do a full Maron episode right now, but I\u2019ve got to let you go. So, to round things out, let\u2019s talk about your career. You\u2019ve accomplished quite a bit: What\u2019s next? Tell me about the future.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s always about doing more, doing something different. For me it\u2019s never been about all that other stuff, It\u2019s always been about being able to get up, write, work on stuff, be on stage every night if I can. Once I started getting really famous in Canada I left for a while because I was like, If I enjoy this too much, I\u2019ll get lazy, and then I\u2019m just thinking about not losing what I have, and if you write when you have a lot to lose, I find it\u2019s never gonna be as good as when you write when you have nothing to lose. So I\u2019ll go to a fresh new market where I have nothing to lose and push myself as far as I want, and if it doesn\u2019t work, I can always go home later, you know? The best thing is having that freedom, being able to create the work I want to create.

aVIf you\u2019ve ever been to the McKittrick Hotel, the site of Punchdrunk\u2019s immersive theater (and mandatory stop for visiting relatives) Sleep No More, you know it can get creepy at night. But even on an afternoon this summer\u2014empty of all Eyes Wide Shut masks, bellhops lip-syncing to Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d or impromptu nude dance sequence in blood baths\u2014the McKittrick still has a looming, menacing presence. Or maybe I was just nervous. After all, I was there to meet Sigourney Weaver, and a dark, semi-abandoned haunted house might have been the wrong call. Why couldn\u2019t I have picked a well-lit coffee shop to interview the star of all the Aliens and Ghostbusters?\u000a\u000aIf I was skittish, Weaver, already posing for photos when I tentatively tiptoed into an empty bar area, seemed entirely at ease. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget, they have my meat in the freezer,\u201d Weaver reminded no one in particular between poses. \u201cI really can\u2019t forget to take the meat with me when I go.\u201d Directly following our interview, Weaver would be driving back to the Adirondacks, and the possibility of leaving the meat (never clarified as to how much there was of it, or what kind) was causing her more anxiety than a Hitchcockian faux-tel. Weaver\u201468 years old and 6 feet tall without heels\u2014can make herself at home in even the most inhospitable of environments.\u000a\u000aThe notion that Sigourney Weaver is the embodiment of the \u201cDIY and take no shit\u201d authority figure for a generation of young women might sound, in retrospect, like a backhanded compliment. But for those of us who grew up as tomboys in the 80s, Weaver stood as shining beacon of some other way to be. While other girls wanted to be Princess Leia or Jasmine, there were always a few of us who wanted to be Ripley. Or later on, Katharine Parker in Working Girl, a woman so ahead of her time in office politicking that she managed to mash-up Claire Underwood from House of Cards and Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, a solid two decades before either existed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect time to be different,\u201d Weaver tells me on the topic of beauty standards, as we slide into a dark and quiet booth in the red-curtained bar room. \u201cI think it\u2019s our time.\u201d She notes her obsession with watching the Olympics. \u201cYou see the glorious range of what women look like, how strong they are. I think this is all changing on screen, as people want to see themselves reflected a little bit more. They don\u2019t want to see some little stick figure up there all the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat inspired me in the beginning was that Vanessa Redgrave was my height,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee, I guess if they want you, they must want your height.\u2019 Realistically, it protected me from being in more prosaic films, because I was never the little girlfriend. I didn\u2019t get to do a lot of love stories, which I think I would have enjoyed. Mostly I did other kinds of movies and other kinds of stories, partly because I was too tall for traditional roles. So it was really these crazy kind of directors who would look at me and say, \u2018You can do this!\u2019 Sometimes it would even be a man\u2019s role. That I didn\u2019t fit into the traditional mold, I think that\u2019s made my career much more interesting, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, that untraditional mold encompasses more than just Weaver\u2019s height and muscle tone. Born in Manhattan as Susan Alexandra Weaver (she renamed herself \u201cSigourney\u201d in 1965, basing it on a small character from The Great Gatsby) to an actress mother and a TV-producing father, Weaver spent her early years attending a series of private and prep schools before turning 18, when she promptly left for Israel and joined a Kibbutz for several months. When she came back to the states, she attended both Sarah Lawrence and Stanford University. She chalks up a lot of her success to the fact that she was an English major in her undergrad years. \u201cAt Stanford, they had a drama department, which I kind of assiduously avoided, because it did very square things. I joined this group called The Company, and we did outrageous new plays. We did commedia dell\u2019arte in a covered wagon and wandered around the Bay Area. A lot of Shakespeare.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough increasingly comfortable outside mainstream theater culture\u2014for a period of time at Stanford, Weaver dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house\u2014the actress did eventually audition for Yale\u2019s prestigious drama graduate program. She showed up to her appointment in a long sheet, tied off with a belt made out of rope, and proceeded to knit together three speeches from Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Saint Joan of the Stockyards. (One day, I would like to produce a line of dolls and accessories for children based on Sigourney Weaver. Not her in character, just Sigourney: She\u2019ll come with her own toga and tree house and well-worn copy of Threepenny Opera, but the car with a trunk carrying a month\u2019s worth of ice-packed sirloin is sold separately.)\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually had a difficult time [at Yale], because they took everything so seriously,\u201d Weaver recalls. \u201cThey gave you your own dressing room. It seemed so lonely to me. Everyone was so competitive. I thought, I really miss my friends, and having everyone do their makeup up in the same little piece of cracked mirror in the back of someone\u2019s truck.\u201d Weaver had to wait until she\u2019d graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1974 before she could recover her sense of community by performing in Off-Broadway shows.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, many of the films Weaver works on tend to have directors that cultivate a similar comrade-in-arms mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re illegitimate films,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201cBut for instance, I just worked with Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie), and we just did this crazy film in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was nothing you\u2019ve heard of. But it was really cool, like his version of a student film. It was really guerrilla filmmaking. It was two takes and move on. I just love working that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater, I will crosscheck her name with Blomkamp\u2019s to see what \u201chis version of a student film\u201d looks like. The movie turns out to be Alien 5.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s surprising to hear Sigourney Weaver talk about her legacy as a feminist movie icon. For beginners, she doesn\u2019t like to think of herself as a genre actress, even though she\u2019s associated with so many tough-as-nails sci-fi heroines.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think genres are very misleading,\u201d she says, almost reproachfully. \u201cRemember, I was an English major, so it was always about the story for me. I never cared what the role was, whether it was big or small.\u201d Same goes for movie franchises: Though she\u2019s a part of the culture, she holds herself at a distance from the Hollywood machine that churns out reboots, sequels and spinoffs with alarming frequency.\u000a\u000a\u2018All good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u2019\u2014 Sigourney Weaver\u000a\u000a\u201cSee, I\u2019m from the very old world, where setting out to make a franchise is a very bad idea,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think when you start off from the idea of a movie being part of a franchise, you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You have to start with one really good script and really good characters. Women have probably suffered, because people have tried to do the franchise thing. You have to find a role, that, whether played by a man or a woman, would be a really compelling character.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat said, Weaver is now attached to another Aliens film along with the upcoming Avatar sequels. \u201cLook, franchises have to be earned,\u201d she stresses. \u201cI know a lot of agents are telling young people nowadays to attach themselves to one. In the old days, that\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019d want, to be locked into a contract like that, for just one role. I\u2019m sure young people are just trying to be in movies. But sometimes even a little tiny movie can go around the world. And then, you see, you can have more of a say in it, should your little movie become a franchise. But first, you need to have a really great writer. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be put together by Hollywood people, adding a little this and that. I just don\u2019t think that works.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver is equally dismissive of the American film industry writ large. \u201cI never really feel like I went to Hollywood,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when I did actually go there, for a film like Ghostbusters, which was a big film by Universal, it was really our story that we were telling, and it felt like it belonged to us.\u201d On the opposite end of the spectrum from the work she\u2019s most well known for are some of her favorite roles, in underrated films like Scott Elliott\u2019s A Map of the World. Or 2006\u2019s Snow Cake, where she got to play opposite Alan Rickman. \u201cOften, when you sell a film to Harvey Weinstein and it\u2019s good,\u201d\u2014Weaver lets down her polished persona for a moment in a flash of teeth that could as easily be a puckish smile as a conspiratorial grimace\u2014\u201che just doesn\u2019t distribute it.\u201d\u000a\u000aEither way, Weaver figures, the old model of movies is on its way to extinction. \u201cThe Hollywood thing is going to be a dinosaur very soon.\u201d People are making and distributing movies on leaner budgets, and releasing them online, without the help of a major studio for distribution. \u201cIt\u2019s already happening, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver\u2019s latest role is in A Monster Calls, which is itself a pretty uncategorizable genre-blend. Ostensibly a kid\u2019s movie (though it\u2019s hard to imagine what child could walk out of the film without being traumatized) based on the \u201clow fantasy\u201d novel by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls takes the messaging of a John Green story and dresses it up in the psychedelic, phantasmagorical guise of a Heavenly Creatures or Pan\u2019s Labyrinth. Liam Neeson is the voice of a talking tree monster that is not Groot, though you could be forgiven for confusing the two. The titular tree monster is summoned to help a young boy Conor (Lewis MacDougall) deal with the impending death of his young mother. (A truly emaciated Felicity Jones, who we can at least agree is having a much better time in this holiday\u2019s other blockbuster escapist hit, Rogue One.) Weaver plays Conor\u2019s British grandmother, a woman who takes the concept of \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d a little too far. When Conor is forced to come live with her, we see that his grandmother has taken the same approach toward interior design: her living room filled with breakable knickknacks and irreplaceable family heirlooms. When Conor, in a fit of fantasy rage (portrayed in beautiful watercolor animation, to differentiate it from the \u201creal\u201d world) reduces the room to shards and splinters, he only has a moment to savor his destruction before hearing the key in the lock. Grandmother\u2019s home.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a testament to both the nuance of the character and Weaver\u2019s portrayal of her that the scene feels like it lasts a lifetime. Without saying a word, Weaver\u2019s eyes widen and waver as she daintily crunches through the wreckage until she comes to the one piece of furniture left untouched. Only then does she bare her teeth and let\u2019s us see the big bad wolf inside, howling in wordless rage and frustration as she deals out the fatal blow to the literal and metaphorical semblance of structure in her life. Then, still mute, she leaves the room, never once looking at Conor, who is screaming apologies and excuses all the while.\u000a\u000aLater, the boy will hear her sobbing in the bathroom, the door locked.\u000a\u000aDespite holding her own no less formidable opponents as ghosts, extraterrestrial slime monsters and even Jennifer Love Hewitt (Heartbreakers, anyone?), there\u2019s something so primal that Weaver tapped into when confronted by the young boy\u2019s outburst. In that moment, I didn\u2019t know if I was terrified of Weaver\u2019s grandmother or for her. The scariest possibility? Probably both.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly? I end up doing a lot of big movies, and I so wanted to do something very small and intimate and very dramatic,\u201d says Weaver on her decision to take the part, adding that she had been interested in working with director J.A. Bayona after seeing two of his films, The Orphanage and The Impossible. \u201cThe story really catches at your heart,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s not a film about cancer but about coming to terms with loss. I just knew Bayona would create something very original and so personal.\u201d\u000a\u000aSigourney Weaver is in a rush to get back upstate, so I remind her to take her frozen meat before asking her my one super-fan question: Did she ever find movies that she starred in too scary?\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, often!\u201d She laughs. \u201cWatching the Alien movies\u2026when you\u2019re on set, acting, you don\u2019t realize the sounds they are going to be adding later. It really does a number on you, when you\u2019re watching it as an audience member.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my scariest role?\u201d Weaver pauses. \u201cMy character in Copycat was completely nuts.\u201d This was her turn as an agoraphobic psychologist in Jon Amiel\u2019s 1995 psychological thriller. (Surprisingly, as I found out, not based on a Thomas Harris novel!) Sigourney Weaver, a.k.a. Ripley, a.k.a. one of the toughest women in the biz, stands up and shudders. \u201cThat woman? She just scared the hell out of me.\u201d

aVChristopher Meloni would like to say he\u2019s sorry. Not to me, per se, sitting across from him in an airy loft above NoHo\u2019s cobblestoned Bond Street, but to his 233,000 Twitter followers, mostly. Maybe a little bit to 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Snatched, in which the actor appears briefly but memorably. Possibly, in a more roundabout, elliptical sort of way, he\u2019s even saying sorry to Snatched co-stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn. \u201cI find it very difficult to stay on point with all the promotion that I should be doing,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cI want to sit here right now and say I do apologize for being distracted at times with the magnitude of the horror that is this administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the Trump Administration, by the way, as in comma Donald. As in current President of the United States / former host of The Apprentice. As in the man who fired FBI Director James Comey just 24 hours after Meloni and I met to discuss a funny little comedy in which he plays a wannabe Indiana Jones-type named Roger. But if you want your \u201ccelebrities, they\u2019re just like us!\u201d moment, understand that Chris Meloni is having that relatable issue focusing on his work, on his art, on the comedy of it all when he feels that every refresh of the Twitter page brings Mad Max: Fury Road one step closer to becoming a documentary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve found this administration, and their stance not only on institutions but facts and numbers, is an outright attack on truth. Which, with every autocrat and in any dystopian novel, that\u2019s rule number one,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cThat there are still followers, I find that very dangerous. And that the attack from people who agree with the administration is to paint it as an \u2018us vs them\u2019 situation. Especially us, the libtards, the Hollywood libtards.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom the moment Meloni noted that he \u201cwoke up in a George Orwell novel today,\u201d the actor has been an active, outspoken and occasionally shirtless voice of #resistance. \u201cThe message\u2014which I\u2019m very poor at conveying, I\u2019ll be the first to admit\u2014is that the fight is not \u2018us vs them,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe fight is not against anything. It\u2019s for truth. And you have to agree on the truth. You can have debates on it, but you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aHe trails off, gazing at his hands. After all, he is here to promote Snatched, not a revolution. Finally, he looks up. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny the science of something like climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeloni\u2019s eyes, more like two storm clouds somehow bored into a rock face, have a way of making simple phrases like \u201cyou just can\u2019t\u201d sound very much like a universally acknowledged fact taught in schools across the nation. Of course I\u2019m not going to argue. If any actor has to keep an eye (or two) on our politicians, maybe it should be Chris Meloni.\u000a\u000aActually, we should probably talk about the eyes. Have you ever had Chris Meloni squint at you? It\u2019s terrifying, it really is. It\u2019s the squint that served him so well over 12 seasons and 273 episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Elliot Stabler. It\u2019s the gaze that\u2014and this is a compliment\u2014makes his August Pullman such an effectively enigmatic bounty hunter on WGN America\u2019s slave-era drama, Underground. Hell, it\u2019s the haunted stare of Meloni\u2019s psychotic yet oddly tender Chris Keller I still remember most from HBO\u2019s groundbreaking prison piece, Oz.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had that since I was a child,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a look, a certain stare. It\u2019s not cultivated, it just is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFunny enough, it\u2019s that look, the certain stare that allows Meloni to move so fluidly, and so often between drama and comedy. Keep his simmering intensity and simply change the context, and suddenly he\u2019s Roger in Snatched, exuding the confidence of Indiana Jones while displaying the skill-set of your local Sports Authority\u2019s junior manager. Or, if you will, suddenly he\u2019s Gene in 2001\u2019s summer-camp comedy Wet Hot American Summer\u2014David Wain\u2019s veritable who\u2019s who of comedy icons, A-listers and award-winners while they were all anything but\u2014the PTSD-ridden Vietnam veteran who also just so happens to be sexually attracted to refrigerators and prone to conversations with a talking can of vegetables (voiced by Archer\u2018s H. Jon Benjamin to boot).\u000a\u000aIn person, Meloni occupies that unique space between comedy and drama near-constantly. He lives in it, probably pays rent. I wondered for a while before this interview what kind of person I\u2019d be speaking to; intense or silly? The slave-catcher or the faux-adventurer? The horror show that was his Oz character, or the freak show that was, well, his Freakshow from Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle? The simplest answer is that he\u2019s both, simultaneously. He jokes, loud and often; when a member of his team requests some tunes, the actor puts on Manchester-based pop-rock band The 1975, a suggestion from his 16-year-old daughter. And yet whenever these endearing moments of levity do come up, Meloni\u2019s smile never quite un-arches those interrogation room eyebrows. It\u2019s not a surprise, then, that the method he describes for choosing his next project is an internal one, almost a zen process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, the spirit moves you,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe soul starts to need a different way to express itself. Whether you\u2019re immersed in comedy and suddenly you want to check out a drama, or if you\u2019ve been living in drama you might need a release valve. I\u2019m led by how I feel.\u201d\u000a\u000aRecently, the spirit led Meloni into the director\u2019s chair for only the second time in his career, when he helmed the season 2 episode of Underground, \u201cAuld Acquaintances.\u201d It was a far cry from his first effort\u2014a co-directing credit on National Lampoon\u2019s Dirty Movie in 2011\u2014that required, but was not limited to, blowing up a house, working around lead actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell\u2019s real-life pregnancy, and a lengthy, half-drunk monologue from his own character. \u201cAs an actor I\u2019m just concerned about me, my point of view vis-a-vi all the other actors and the moment,\u201d he says, then leans forward as if sharing a secret. \u201cAs a director, you have to be aware of everything.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re aware of the scene that happened before, while envisioning the scene after, and where this particular moment resonates, plus where each character\u2019s journey goes from here,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen you have to negotiate that, because maybe your idea doesn\u2019t sit with their idea. You have to make decisions on everything. How big do you want the bottle to be, what\u2019s the gun size? Is there a rug or isn\u2019t there a rug? You have to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page, and the page is your vision. Where to set up the camera, when that camera moves, how that camera moves.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy the expansion into directing? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s always that thought of \u2018Once I\u2019m done with this project, I\u2019m technically unemployed.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aClassic case of actor\u2019s dilemma, yes, but Meloni is set for the near-future at least. As part of the latest of what seems like many brand reboots, the SyFy network ordered a pilot for Happy!, adapted from Grant Morrison\u2019s graphic novel. Meloni will star as ex-cop turned mafia hitman Nick Sax, who gets his life back on track with the help of a tiny, blue winged horse voiced by Saturday Night Live\u2018s Bobby Moynihan.\u000a\u000aWhich is great news for fans of a dead-eyed Chris Meloni speaking to imaginary friends. In June, the actor also reprises his Wet Hot role for Netflix\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later (set a decade after the 2001 original, and acting as a follow-up to Netflix\u2019s surprisingly ingenious First Day of Camp). \u201cIt\u2019s all set. All in the can. Ready to roll,\u201d Meloni says on the status of the Wet Hot sequel, but is genuinely tight-lipped about where we will find the appliance-loving Gene.\u000a\u000aThe actor takes a long pause, then finally tells me \u201cGene is a solitary figure leading a life of mystery. He\u2019s trying to get his act together. He\u2019s finding a purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it wasn\u2019t plot-points that brought Meloni back to Camp Firewood in the first place. 10 Years Later reunites the cast\u2014loaded with names like Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd\u2014as well as original creators David Wain and Michael Showalter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know those guys. I trust their sensibilities so much, know their work ethic,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cThey have such a command of the material that it\u2019s really a no-brainer for me. I tell people all the time, it\u2019s like going home again.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe sits up straight then, coming to a much, much more appropriate analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to camp,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get to play with all your old friends.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt that, I swear, his eyes almost soften. Almost.

aVAlison Wright makes one hell of a first impression. \u201cI\u2019m dying right now,\u201d the actress says mere moments after we meet, laughing and draping a blanket over her shoulders nearly as thick as her Sunderland accent. The situation is understandable, though. We sit down to talk in the back of a Brooklyn photography studio less than 24 hours after Wright made her Broadway debut in Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat, not to mention on the same Sunday the actress returns to TV in Feud: Bette and Joan, from reigning king of the anthology series, Ryan Murphy. It\u2019s an impressive, back-to-back series of accomplishments\u2014especially from someone introduced to American audiences just four years ago on The Americans\u2014that demands a celebration late into the night, early morning interview be damned.\u000a\u000aWell, early afternoon interview.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, though, if this is talking to Wright while she\u2019s dying, I\u2019d love to meet her living. The Lee Strasberg Institute graduate smiles easy and often; she answers questions with a stage performer\u2019s poise mingled with a charisma made for cameras. She\u2019s whip quick, too. At one point, to demonstrate her preparation for the 1961-set Feud, Wright seamlessly adopts an old-school American accent. \u201cWell, good morning, Ms. Crawford,\u201d she says, in a voice you might have heard echoing from Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre in an era when most of the handprints out front were still drying. Wright calls it \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood sound,\u201d and you recognize it immediately even without being able to describe how.\u000a\u000aIt is exactly \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood\u201d\u2014for better, but often for worse\u2014which Feud concerns itself with. The eight-episode anthology series chronicles the behind-the-scenes conflict of 1962 thriller Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which starred veritable screen legends and perennial rivals Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon). Come for the Hollywood Sign-sized drama\u2014bask in the shade, if you will\u2014but stay for a dive far deeper than the surface scratched by a cat-fight, a look at a film machine built by men, for men and the women it used, abused and spit out the moment the lens caught a wrinkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe knows the only time you pay attention to a woman is when she\u2019s in front of a camera,\u201d Wright, as assistant Pauline Jameson, tells Baby Jane director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in Feud\u2019s first episode. The \u201cshe,\u201d in this case, just happens to be one of Aldrich\u2019s many par-for-the-course affairs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intention was never just to make campy, kitschy fun,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how difficult it was for these women in the last 10, 15 years of their lives, at a time when their male counterparts were just beginning, and becoming more distinguished. Their life supply was cut off, really, for both of them, because they turned 50 years old.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Pauline, Wright has the unique task of portraying one of the few Feud roles to not exist in real life. Instead, Pauline operates as an amalgam of the show\u2019s more pressing themes. The assistants who should have been studio heads. The authoritative voices drowned out by the clacking of a secretary\u2019s typewriter. The woman who, quite literally, picked Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? from a pile of ideas and handed it off to a man.\u000a\u000a\u201cPauline is a composite of all the women who worked in the studio systems,\u201d Wright says. \u201cMy character represents a lot of these women who were very great and capable at their job, at a time everyone expected your endgame to be marriage and kids. Pauline wants to be a director. She wants a future in the business.\u201d\u000a\u000aWright\u2019s preparation went beyond adopting an accent; she adopted a mindset. \u201cWhat would it feel like if marriage and kids were not your endgame plan? Because it definitely isn\u2019t for Pauline. Back then, that made you unusual already, right there.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt always blows me away that, in this country, a woman couldn\u2019t have a credit card without her husband until 1974,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cI\u2019d just think about all these things where you would never believe that was actually the case until you actually find out that it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich is where Feud takes on an eerie undertone more akin to Murphy\u2019s other anthology series, where it becomes something of an actual American horror story, where you notice the trials and tribulations of that old Hollywood don\u2019t seem too different than those of that new Hollywood.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Wright says, eyes flashing. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. That it\u2019s not any different. Ryan is looking at, well, how far have things actually progressed in these 50, 60 years?\u201d\u000a\u000aBEGIN FLASHBACK:\u000a\u000aINT. 89TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS \u2013 EVENING\u000a\u000aActress BRIE LARSON refuses to applaud onstage as CASEY AFFLECK accepts his Best Actor win amid allegations of sexual assault. MEL GIBSON (choice dialogue: \u201cYou look like a fucking pig in heat,\u201d in reference to ex-wife Oksana Grigorieva) sits in the audience, smiling.\u000a\u000aEND FLASHBACK\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cSo I know exactly how it is to be a woman and move through the world. So this shit,\u201d referring to Feud, to Baby Jane, to Hollywood, to everything, \u201cit still applies.\u201d\u000a\u000aI ask Wright what first step needs to be taken toward a more inclusive Hollywood, and she tells me that step has already been taken\u2014by none other than Ryan Murphy himself. In early 2016, the uber-producer introduced the Half foundation to his Ryan Murphy Productions, an initiative that promised to fill at least 50 percent of his various shows\u2019 director slots with women. True to his word, Feud\u2019s eight-episode run sees two episodes helmed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton (American Horror Story, The Americans), another from Liza Johnson (Good Girls Revolt) and a penultimate chapter overseen by Oscar-winning actress turned director, Helen Hunt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are more women on Ryan\u2019s set than I have ever seen, anywhere,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cThere was a woman behind each camera. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Wright\u2014who came to the States 19 years ago and has lived and worked here ever since\u2014the shocking part of this conversation is the fact it\u2019s still a conversation at all. \u201cWomen are half of society, you know?\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the people who are making decisions, or making the content, are all just white guys in their 50s, that\u2019s the only perspective you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is, undoubtedly, a continuous uphill climb. The world did not change after it found out what happened to Baby Jane. This is the same Hollywood in which Sally Fields played Tom Hanks\u2019 mother in Forrest Gump, just six years after playing his love interest in 1988\u2019s Punchline. In which Feud\u2019s own Susan Sarandon (then 67) was old enough to play a 43-year-old Melissa McCarthy\u2019s grandmother in 2014\u2019s Tammy. In which the Hollywood-commanding, billion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe\u201415 films so far and seemingly continuing on into infinity\u2014has yet to use a single female director.\u000a\u000a\u2018Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If [women are] not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cStep one, we just need to get more women onto sets,\u201d Wright says. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is by going out of your way to demand that\u2019s what you want. The studios will bring Ryan, or whoever the director is, a selection of people to choose from. But if there\u2019s no women in that group . . .\u201d\u000a\u000aIf I absolutely had to guess, I\u2019d say the deep sigh that follows has nothing to do with last night\u2019s festivities. But after a moment, unsurprisingly, she is composed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut then, Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If we\u2019re not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u201d\u000a\u000aCase in point: The time, quite recently, a reality TV star caught on tape detailing his desire to grab a woman \u201cby the pussy\u201d was elected president of the United States. An occurrence that, as fate would have it, landed directly during the production of Feud.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course the election happened right in between shooting,\u201d Wright remembers. \u201cWe all thought it was going to be a certain way. We thought Hillary Clinton was going to be our president. We were going to have a girl in charge. And then it was like, \u2018Oh, no, no, we\u2019re still a very sexist, misogynist country. Let\u2019s not forget that we haven\u2019t traveled that far.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSomething key to note: Throughout our conversation, Wright refrains from mentioning the president by name; she says, simply, \u201ca certain man.\u201d The time before January 20 is \u201cpre-him.\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of this, she says, is to avoid \u201cgiving him his time.\u201d But mostly, it\u2019s a way to separate her work, her art, from burdening politics. Especially Nottage\u2019s Sweat, a play that, on the surface, is a clear-cut mirror of the modern political scene. Set in the industrial town of Reading, Pennsylvania, Sweat focuses on the post-war decline of the working class, of prosperity giving way to uncertainty. Wright plays Jessie, a woman hit hard by sudden unemployment, and harder by the alcohol she uses to forget it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t always get to be a part of something that\u2019s actually important in terms of society and where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d says Wright, the only new cast member added after the play\u2019s Off-Broadway transfer. \u201cBut this is timely, and it\u2019s actually an important piece of art in terms of reflecting back the state of our society at the moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sweat, which Nottage wrote after extensive interviews between 2001 and 2008 with old factory town workers, \u201cis not about the man who is president.\u201d Wright is adamant. \u201cIt\u2019s about the state of the American working class.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s interesting, though, the projects and roles Wright continues to find herself in\u2014Feud, Sweat, The Americans, this interview itself\u2014that require a deeper look than a first glance. That are far, far more than a first impression. It\u2019s the reason Wright\u2019s Martha on The Americans\u2014who began as near-comic relief and ended her run as the epitome of quiet strength\u2014reminds me of Feud\u2019s Pauline Jameson, despite the years and genres between them.\u000a\u000aWright nods at the comparison. \u201cWell, neither of them are the first two women to be underestimated.\u201d And, despite it all, she grins. \u201cOr the last.\u201d

aVIn December 2007, James Devine, a Union County political operative/newspaper publisher, was arrested for owing $20,000 in child support and alimony.\u000a\u000aIt was the latest fall from grace for Devine, a former Union County Democratic insider. Devine had been, as recently as a few years ago, a somewhat important operative in local political circles, running three weekly newspapers in Union County that depended heavily on financing from county advertisements and legal notices. But when that revenue stream abruptly ended, Devine was out of business and out of luck \u2013 a turn of events he blames on Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, a former political ally who he had a falling out with in the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aNow he\u2019s working to beat Bollwage, who is seeking re-election in the June 3 Democratic primary.\u000a\u000aBut Devine\u2019s detractors hold nothing but venom for a man they characterize as a charlatan who has mucked up the political scene in Union County for decades, and who recently had his bank account frozen for owing tens of thousands in back taxes \u2013 something Devine blames on bad legal advice and child support payments.\u000a\u000aSome public officials who are used to choosing their words carefully don\u2019t hesitate to go on the record slamming Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a sleaze ball, the worst in politics,\u201d said Democratic State Chairman Joseph Cryan, who also represents Union County in the State Assembly. \u201cIf they pay him anything, I hope he used it towards his child support.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter helping political newcomer Wilda Diaz topple eighteen-year incumbent Mayor Joseph Vas in Perth Amboy, Devine has set his sights on ousting Bollwage, who\u2019s held the office since 1993.\u000a\u000aDevine is helping run the campaigns of a slate of four candidates against Bollwage and three at-large council members: Edward Jackus, Frank Cuesta and Patricia Perkins-Auguste. The team is led by political neophyte Edward Bryant Koon, a juvenile detention officer. Running for council-at-large on Koon\u2019s slate are Board of Education President Armando Da Silva; George O\u2019Grady, the board of education\u2019s community-attendance liaison; and former councilman Samuel Rodriguez, who ran for mayor in 1988.\u000a\u000a\u201cI regret the mistakes that I made. I am sorry for them and I hope to make good,\u201d said Devine. \u201cI plan to straighten things out. I didn\u2019t file tax returns for several years. Why? Because I had no idea what my financial picture was. I don\u2019t have enough money to hire accountants to untangle the web that the courts and politicians have conspired against me with.\u201d\u000a\u000aDevine\u2019s feud with Bollwage goes back to 1991, when Devine challenged then-Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn for his Assembly seat. Bollwage, Devine said, never came through with promised support for that campaign, and a year later \u2013 after Bollwage won his first term as mayor \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t support Devine for the 5th ward council seat.\u000a\u000aThe three community newspapers that Devine later picked up \u2014 The News Record and The Patriot \u2014 had essentially been mouthpieces Democratic Establishment in Union County (he also ran the The Adams Tabloid & Citizen Gazette in Middlesex). But after running some critical stories of Bollwage, Devine said, the mayor conspired with Union County Democratic Chairwoman Charlotte DeFilippo and State Sen. Raymond Lesniak to take away the county\u2019s business.\u000a\u000aDevine admitted that the papers leaned towards favoring his clients, but said that it\u2019s typical of small community papers.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore my eyes had been open, I probably was more sympathetic towards the government in Union County,\u201d said Devine. \u201cMy papers were a lot smaller than The Star-Ledger or any other paper that might make claims of journalistic integrity and objectivity, but these were probably no different than any other weekly papers in the state. Clearly there will be a difference when there\u2019s an iron wall between people who do advertising and editorial. In weekly newspapers it\u2019s the same guy, and it\u2019s the same guy who makes corporate decisions and takes out the garbage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy 2006, Devine unloaded the papers. Broke and beaten down from a divorce and car accident, he ultimately found himself missing child support payments, which he traces back to his papers\u2019 ruin.\u000a\u000aLesniak, for his part, denies Devine\u2019s claims of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat never happened. The county was, quite frankly, looking for ways to cut taxes, and that was an extra expense that wasn\u2019t really required,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there was a dispute as to whether he was charging the correct amount for the ads. He lost the Rahway ads as a result of that if I\u2019m not mistaken. I was very resentful of that because he was overcharging for the type sizes. So it was a combination: a dispute over his fees and looking to cut costs, and he took it personally.\u201d\u000a\u000aKoon, for his part, said that Bollwage doesn\u2019t acknowledge a gang problem that plagues the city, and has made crime and property taxes the top issue of his campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that our city needs a change,\u201d said Koon. \u201cTaxes have increased , we have serious gang problem and crime going on in our community, and I believe City Hall should make an effort to deal with crime. Instead of sitting back and doing nothing I\u2018ve decided to run for mayor.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the stronger denunciations of Bollwage come from Devine. The city has lost its well-paying manufacturing jobs, replaced by low wage part-time employers who don\u2019t provide benefits, he said. Bollwage ushered in a wave of development during his four terms as mayor and ten years on the council, like the Ikea just off the Turnpike and the Jersey Gardens Mall.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no Wal-Mart in Elizabeth, but Chris Bollwage did Wal-Mart Elizabeth,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aDevine sees a similarity between Bollwage\u2019s tenure as mayor and Vas in nearby Perth Amboy. They\u2019ve both been in office since the early 1990\u2019s, both remain personally popular, but may be vulnerable to a nationwide mood for change and complaints about tax increases.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople know the mayor and like him, but nobody should be mayor for 20 years,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aLesniak disputes similarities between Bollwage and Vas. First off, unlike Vas, Bollwage never canceled a Puerto Rican Day Parade \u2013 something that put Vas at odds with his city\u2019s large Latino community. Moreover, unlike Diaz, Koon has little name recognition.\u000a\u000a\u201cMayor Vas had a credible opponent. Nobody knows Mayor Bollwage\u2019s opponent,\u201d said Lesniak.\u000a\u000aWhile some local politicos cast doubt on just how integral a role Devine played in the Perth Amboy upset, Diaz said that he did indeed help.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought that he did really well with us,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aBollwage defended his accomplishments as mayor, but refused to address anything having to do with Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on him in any way shape or form. I\u2019m not going to comment on anything he has to say or do. He\u2019s not a candidate,\u201d said Bollwage. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on why political consultants do things. I always think it\u2019s because they\u2019re getting paid.\u201d\u000a\u000aBollwage dismisses his challenge as another aspect of the historically tense relationship between the city\u2019s school board and mayor\u2019s office, which began with Mayor Dunn\u2019s opposition to an elected school board. He argued that Koon was fielded to run for mayor because of an old association with the Superintendent of schools, and that two of Koon\u2019s running mates are affiliated with the school board.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019d like to show me out and run the whole show,\u201d said Bollwage.\u000a\u000aBollwage also says he has not ignored the city\u2019s crime problem, arguing that he\u2019s presided over the institution of after-school programs, expansion of the D.A.R.E. program and is working with prosecutors to make them a frequent presence at community meetings.\u000a\u000aHe points out that he can\u2019t be blamed for the city\u2019s loss of well-paying jobs, a condition far from unique to old industrial cities. Instead, he points to an unemployment rate that was somewhere between 11 and 12% at the beginning of his term, and stood at only 6.4% as of last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting that they would blame me for bringing in jobs. I find that a novel political argument,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blue collar jobs already left the community when I became mayor, so my choices were how to put people in the city of Elizabeth to work. What we did was take advantage of our location near Newark airport and other transportation, created a service economy where people that live here will have access to work and employment.\u201d

aVVanessa Bayer created some memorable characters during her seven year stint on NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live, and while she was never a breakout star in the mold of Kate McKinnon, she proved herself to be a very funny and capable performer. Her final season efforts earned her her first-ever Emmy nomination, and fans are interested in what she does next. But before looking forward, Bayer has taken the time to reflect on the recent past.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt felt like it was time for me,\u201d Bayer said when asked by THR why she left SNL. \u201cI had seven seasons and just felt like it was time for someone else to do that job.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo how did the cast take the news?\u000a\u000a\u201cColin [Jost] wrote this goodbye sketch for the people who were leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wrote this song, and all the details he put in it were about me talking about my sketch group from college and how I bring my brother and best friend to every show. I didn\u2019t realize he knew me so well. You make such close friends there.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Bayer was featured in a ton of sketches and had the opportunity to write a lot of hilarious characters, she does remember one sketch that never made it to air.\u000a\u000a\u201cSomething that never got on [the show] was that I would try to write these backstage sketches where I would go into the host\u2019s dressing room and be really scary and aggressive to them because that\u2019s not my personality. I\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, don\u2019t step on my lines.\u2019 I thought it would be funny that onscreen I\u2019m really smiley, but behind the scenes everyone is really scared of me. It never got on because I think even me pretending to be scary is sweet and silly.\u201d\u000a\u000aHonestly, we\u2019d love to see that. We\u2019re going to miss Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy and Bayer\u2019s dead-on impression of Rachel from Friends. But, fans won\u2019t have to wait too long to see Bayer perform again as she\u2019s set to co-star in the romance comedy Ibiza due out in 2018.

aVIf you are standing right now, I suggest you sit down, because we\u2019re going to begin with some truly shocking news: Aubrey Plaza is not a 50-year-old man.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, this should be clear to anyone who has followed Plaza on her rise to stardom over the years\u2014the seven seasons portraying the human embodiment of an eye-roll, April Ludgate, on NBC\u2019s Parks & Recreation, her quieter standout roles in indies like Safety Not Guaranteed and Ned Rifle, or more recent big-screen endeavors like Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Certainly, it\u2019s clear to me, sitting across from the actress at a Los Feliz noodle bar, a month before she\u2019s set to co-star in Legion, FX\u2019s Marvel-universe mind-bender from Fargo creator Noah Hawley.\u000a\u000aBut is it clear to Hawley? Harder to say. In the original pilot script for Legion, Hawley wrote the character of Lenny Busker as a male, middle-aged former drug-addict, the resident, older sage of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, providing both optimism and advice to our mutant main character David Haller (Dan Stevens). The question becomes, What made the writer-director, after a single meeting with Plaza, decide the 32-year-old actress would be a perfect fit for the part?\u000a\u000a\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she says and laughs, before changing tact. \u201cI mean, no, I get it. I think that maybe that\u2019s my real, underneath persona, and at heart, I\u2019m like a 50-year-old drug addict living in a mental hospital. And Noah saw that\u2019s who I am, really, underneath it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a typical answer from Plaza. You often don\u2019t realize she\u2019s joking until halfway through a sentence, and by then it turns into a game of catch-up with an Upright Citizens Brigade veteran. But it\u2019s not a cold-shoulder thing, either, not a heightened social awkwardness. Despite what every interview with the actress written between 2009 and 2015 would have you believe, she\u2019s not actually April Ludgate. The first order of business she suggests after sitting down is that we take a C-Shot together. Despite having no idea what a C-Shot is, I agree. \u201cGreat, let\u2019s just go crazy,\u201d she replies, stone-faced.\u000a\u000a\u201cCrazy,\u201d as it turns out, is an apropos way to begin any conversation over Legion. Any viewer expecting the formulaic blueprint of your typical Marvel blockbuster\u2014the family tragedy, the unwilling hero, the British thespian hamming it up as the villain, etcetera, etcetera\u2014is likely to come away disappointed or, at least, plenty confused.\u000a\u000aThe character of David Haller has been around in paper-and-ink form since 1985 when writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz brought him to life in New Mutants #25. The son of chrome-domed psychic Charles Xavier (a spoiler for the comics but not, as far as I know, the show), Haller is the human equivalent of an overbooked hotel; his mutant ability is essentially a heightened form of dissociative identity disorder, formerly known by its cruder term \u201csplit personality,\u201d with each unique persona adding to a deafening cacophony of separate abilities.\u000a\u000aWith Legion, Hawley has taken this idea\u2014what if you were several \u201cyous\u201d somehow simultaneously\u2014and translated it to the small screen in a way that is not only immersive and exciting but, at times, overwhelmingly confusing. Characters jump timelines and swap bodies. Reality often shifts, without warning, or gives way completely to another layer underneath, and on at least one occasion, that layer is a synchronized dance number. To wit, Legion is weird\u2014and unlike anything Marvel has done before.\u000a\u000aAnd through it all\u2014the confusion, complexity and chaos\u2014the one constant remains Plaza\u2019s blood-shot Lenny Busker. \u201cMy goal was for Lenny to be the happy place for David, at all times,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaving that to focus on, with all that other bad stuff lingering in the background for me, was a good combination. It helped me play the character as someone fighting against the bad stuff and allowed it to be more than just, \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m so crazy. I\u2019m like, totally tweaking out.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat border, between comic-book storytelling and the reality of mental illness, is where Legion walks its finest line. After all, the series\u2019 main thesis, spouted from inside a psychiatric hospital, is that occasionally the illness is your strength, and more dangerously, the voices in your head might be telling some form of truth. In a scene from the pilot, David, Lenny and newcomer Syd (Rachel Keller) sit in support group, while a doctor grills them on their respective problems. \u201cWhat if your problems are in your head?\u201d Syd asks. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not even problems?\u201d\u000a\u000aLenny, who until then is too busy grooving to oversized headphones to participate, leans forward. \u201cI like you,\u201d she says, eyes wide. \u201cYou got what the kids these days call \u2018moxie.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI liked the idea, and I think Noah really likes the idea, of having Lenny be this optimist despite the challenges she\u2019s facing,\u201d Plaza tells me. \u201cYou have this character in a mental hospital. She\u2019s a drug addict. She pretty much has everything possible going wrong for her. But she\u2019s the one making jokes, to cheer David up, to be the bright light in it all. That was interesting to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith that, our C-Shots arrived, a mixture of cayenne pepper and lemon that, very much like Legion, is simultaneously refreshing and hard to swallow. We drink. I cough. She does not.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s entirely plausible that the reason Hawley saw Lenny Busker as fluid is Plaza herself, as a character actress, is nearly impossible to typecast down. Every move post-Parks, even across from Robert De Niro in the critically maligned yet financially successful Dirty Grandpa, has looked like a move away from an April Ludgate-shaped trap, marked with that dreaded qualifier, \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This, Plaza tells me, is deliberate. \u201cThere was definitely a time where people couldn\u2019t see beyond April Ludgate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in playing all different types of parts, and getting those parts are hard when people put you in a box.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwo Plaza-starring features debuted at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, as different as they were successful. The first, Ingrid Goes West, is part social media satire, part twisted road-trip film. Plaza, who also served as producer, plays Ingrid, an Instagram-obsessive who moves across the country to befriend social-celebrity Ingrid Sloane (played by Marvel peer Elizabeth Olsen, of Avengers fame). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a social media commentary, but it\u2019s not really about that,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about human relationships, and human connections, and how some people have a really hard time making them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA phenomenon, to prove there is no limit to art imitating life, that Plaza knows all too well. A few days prior to our conversation, the actress deleted her Twitter account (@EvilHag, of course), an act nearly blasphemous in the age of instant information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a long time coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like it made sense to do it right before the new year started, some kind of lame way of saying, \u2018Fuck it, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019 I realized that it was adding nothing positive to my life. It was unhealthy. It just bummed me out, honestly.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza\u2019s second Sundance offering is, well, a little harder to explain, 140 characters or not, even for the actress herself. The Little Hours, Plaza\u2019s third collaboration with writer-director Jeff Baena, has so many conflicting personalities it could star in Legion. At once a faithful adaptation of 14th-Century novella collection The Decameron and a raunchy comedy, the film sees Plaza playing a nun but not really, she warns, without further explanation. But yes, a nun (kind of), forced to live in a convent in the age of the Bubonic Plague. \u201cIt\u2019s almost academic. I think colleges would show it to explain that time period,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIf, you know, it wasn\u2019t so fucked up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with starring beside the likes of John C. Reilly, Alison Brie and Dave Franco, Plaza was put on prayer duty; that is to say, Baena asked the Catholic born-and-raised actress to ensure The Little Hours\u2019 dialogue, in between the countless \u201cfucks,\u201d was as Biblically accurate as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was kind of funny because I was working on Legion, which is a very different thing, a very dark thing,\u201d Plaza remembers, \u201cand I kept switching from that to literally reading the Bible at night. I, like, stole the Bible from my hotel room.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd as she reads, she remembers: memories, she tells me, of a childhood in a Catholic home, of leading mass as cantor, of Bible study and even of her very first paying job working the front desk of a convent attached to her all-girls high school. \u201cI just sat there and answered phone calls, mainly from the shoe cobbler who would have the nuns\u2019 shoes nice and cobbled.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing really crazy happened. I wish I had a scandalous nun story for you,\u201d she continues. I point out the cosmic irony of, decades later, playing a nun herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Plaza smiles. A few weeks later, reviews pour out of Sundance for The Little Hours, focusing primarily on sacramental wine chugging, chastity-vow breaking and a particular scene in which Plaza pelts a man with radishes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make them all so proud.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza began her 2017 with a dance. As the clock struck midnight on December 31, the actress, her Twitter deleted, Legion set to debut in two months, had a single resolution. \u201cMy goal was to start a legit dance party,\u201d she tells me.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had a massive New Year\u2019s Eve party at my house, about 200 people,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe packed it in. There was one point, right before midnight, there were so many people there you couldn\u2019t move. It was a fire hazard. And I wanted to get everyone to a dance floor.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza keeps herself busy with work\u2014\u201cI only act,\u201d she tells me, a statement that remains true well into 2017\u2014and doesn\u2019t really do New Year\u2019s Resolutions, or, at least, can think of none off the top of her head. Which makes this single objective, in the middle of a packed house, a unique one.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were playing all of the songs you want to hear\u2014Bowie, Prince, George Michael\u2014we were trying to do a whole, \u2018Can you fucking believe what happened in 2016?\u2019 playlist. But then I just was like, We gotta get some Chance the Rapper and start getting down and dirty with it. I felt there was kind of an energy to that party where everyone was just like, \u2018Ugh, I want to dance off 2016, get it out and start over.\u2019 That\u2019s all I wanted, and it happened, right after midnight.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was,\u201d she continues, \u201cwhat the kids these days call \u2018a rager.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aListening back over the interview audio later, things clicked into place right there, mostly, I imagine, because Plaza borrowed a phrase from her own character, Lenny Busker, the aforementioned \u201cwhat the kids these days call\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aNot to presume I understand Noah Hawley\u2014there are still parts of Legion I couldn\u2019t describe, even on a good day\u2014but on one particular point, I could attempt a guess. What did he see in Plaza, in one meeting, that made her the perfect fit for Lenny Busker? Let her tell you a story over one interview, over one meeting, and the matter of gender and age fall away; instead, you see there is no difference, really, between the woman who looked at a year of darkness, death and uncertainty and thought first of a dance-floor, and Lenny Busker, the eternal optimist in oversized headphones, lighting the way through the mental asylum.

aVFans of quality cinema have to be impressed with how Amazon Studios has handled itself in Hollywood. Notable recent projects have included The Big Sick, a genre redefining rom-com co-distributed with Lionsgate, and the Academy Award-nominated Manchester By The Sea, co-distributed with Roadside Attractions. With those building blocks in place earning a ton of good will, Amazon has taken the next logical step of distributing their own titles. Last week, they nabbed Woody Allen\u2018s Wonder Wheel and now TheWrap is reporting that they have acquired Aaron Sorkin\u2018s Lucille Ball biopic, rumored to have Cate Blanchett attached to star.\u000a\u000aNow THAT is how you hit the ground running in your first few years as a real studio. Lure top tier talent with promises of creative freedom and solid financial backing and let them do their thing. Trust the creatives to, you know, be creative.\u000a\u000aAccording to TheWrap, the biopic will follow Ball\u2019s 20-year marriage to Desi Arnaz and their work together on the Hall of Fame sitcom I Love Lucy.\u000a\u000aFor any of you that don\u2019t know, Ball was a Daenerys Targaryen-esque figure in the entertainment industry. The Breaker of Glass Ceilings, the Creator of Conglomerates, the Funniest Woman in all the Realm. She was the first female to run a major television studio and pioneered several production methods still used today such as the use of a live studio audience during filming and multi-cam sitcoms. More ground-breaking was the deal she struck to ensure that the rights to her production company\u2019s projects would remain with her, an unprecedented move at the time. This was one shrewd business leader, ladies and gentlemen.\u000a\u000aBlanchett is no stranger to biopics; she won her first Oscar for playing Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Aviator. She can next be seen in Thor: Ragnarok and Ocean\u2019s Eight. Sorkin, meanwhile, is the writer and director of Jessica Chastain\u2019s Molly\u2019s Game.\u000a\u000aThis should be considered a big win for Amazon, which has done a great job of finding adult-skewing critically acclaimed films that are also solid performers at the box office. In a Hollywood playing field dominated by franchises, Amazon is cleverly putting together a lineup of smaller counter-programming offerings.

aV\u201cThe amazing thing about La Perla is we do lingerie, nightwear and sleepwear, so we can encompass your entire life. From the time you wake up in your pajamas, go to the office wearing our suits, to evening wear and then back to your nighty, we encompass it all,\u201d La Perla\u2019s creative director Julia Haart explained, while curled up in a round leather booth in the Lamb\u2019s Club. The designer was wearing a red zip-up hoodie and an insanely high pair of heeled boots of her own design.\u000a\u000aIt was a chilly February morning, directly following the designer\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 runway extravaganza, where Naomi Campbell donned a silky nighty, Lindsey Wixson walked in a bright purple bralette, Sasha Pivovarova rocked a plaid skirt suit, and Kendall Jenner closed the show in a nearly see-through gown. The models lounged on the couches, chairs and balconies, in a number of different rooms of the \u201cLa Perla Manor\u201d set, before descending a grand staircase and strutting the runway. Taking place on the first day of New York Fashion Week, this grand gesture was an impressive way to start off the season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked the casting agent Piergiorgio [Del Moro] for diversity. I do not want to see 40 white girls, that\u2019s not the world we live in and that\u2019s not the people I want to sell to. I want to dress every woman. I also wanted women with personality. Don\u2019t just give me beautiful women; give me sexy, fun, confident, strong women!\u201d she explained.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Vogue said it best in their runway review. \u201cShe is presumably catering to those women that might tune into the Victoria\u2019s Secret show (as it happens, a number of her Fall cast are also Angels) but would never actually buy Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014all La Perla, all the way,\u201d they wrote. Surely, the Victoria\u2019s Secret formula is there: world-class models, an over-the-top set and plenty of lacy lingerie. But there was more.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very honored, it\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Haart replied, when asked about the comparison. \u201cThe only thing is that Victoria\u2019s Secret is a lingerie show, mine was a ready-to-wear show, so that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges. We may have come from a lingerie background but we have taken it to the next level.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s true. La Perla is a go-to for sexy lace bras and barely there underwear with luxury price tags, but they also offer slinky evening gowns and blazers with wireless bra cups built in. Not only do you factor in your clothing size with a La Perla ready-to-wear purchase, but your bra size is considered, too. Have you ever bought a jacket in a size 38 cup AB? Or a shirt in a 44 cup CD?\u000a\u000aHowever, the starring roles belong to the fabrics used by the company, these firm foundations are truly something to marvel over. Haart has incorporated stretch into nearly every material, offering a silk dress with 10 percent Elastane that is wrinkle-resistant. She has also developed a fine stretch-lace that actually moves with the body. Haart wants women to feel as comfortable in their clothing as they feel in their lingerie. She doesn\u2019t believe that women should have to choose between looking good and feeling comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of my materials have stretch, so you can literally kickbox in everything,\u201d she semi-joked. \u201cNot that you\u2019re necessarily going to want to kickbox in an evening gown, but if the mood instructs you\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAppointed to the creative director role in August 2016, it is clear that the buxom but petite Haart knows a thing or two about finding flattering clothing to fit her frame. She had actually worked with the brand before this past summer; advising the team on two accessories collaborations, starting with the Fall/Winter 2016 season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had my own shoe line, so I first started making shoes for La Perla, as a collaboration. Then it was \u2018Julia can you design handbags?\u2019 And \u2018Julia can you design men\u2019s shoes?\u2019 Eventually, \u2018Can you help with the collection?\u2019 And here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince being installed in this top creative role, Haart has cemented her status as a power player. In December, she co-hosted a celebration for a Goop pop-up in Santa Monica. Gwyneth Paltrow showed up to the dinner in a black corset suit and leggings from La Perla (Ms. P also made a rare front row appearance at the brand\u2019s February fashion show).\u000a\u000aLa Perla also co-sponsored Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2018s Los Angeles celebration of the 150 Most Fashionable Women in January 2017, where Haart appeared on the red carpet sandwiched between Kendall Jenner and Liu Wen (who, if you recall, both walked in recent fashion shows for Victoria\u2019s Secret and La Perla). These two models also starred in the latest La Perla ad campaign, donning suits in celestial prints, dresses decorated with sultry lace and corset details; they shared the campaign with Isabeli Fontana. Shot by Steven Klein and artistically directed by Fabien Baron, this was Haart\u2019s inaugural campaign for the brand. The theme behind the shoot? \u201cThe liberation of every woman from the need to suffer for beauty,\u201d of course. Despite the clothing, the ads still offer a little something for the lingerie fans faithful to the brand since its inception in 1954.\u000a\u000aAlso promoting the ready-to-wear range was the brand\u2019s new Milan flagship, which opened this past fashion week. Located on via Montenapoleone, the new marble-clad store doubled in size, spanning 2,583 square feet over two floors. Haart admitted that the moving to a bigger store was necessary for accommodating her expanded clothing collections. This is understandable when you realize her Fall/Winter 2017 collection contained a whopping 225 pieces.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone keeps asking me \u2018Who is the La Perla woman?\u2019 And I hate that question so much. Who am I to determine what a woman should look like?\u201d Haart expressed in exasperation, back in New York. She went on to explain that she is not precious about how say, a stylist might dress an actress in her designs, many of which are simple tailored staples. She is unconcerned if her looks are paired with other brands, she just wants the La Perla pieces to look good. Haart has set out to dress every woman, to help them embrace their curves and the make them feel comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to make women feel more confident with themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to look in the mirror and say damn I look fine. That\u2019s my only job.

aVThe LA Power 25\u000a\u000aHow do you even define power in a place as decentralized and diffuse as Los Angeles? While culling this subjective list, we defined power as: for whom do you drop everything the moment their name flashes on your phone? Yes, I can see you\u2019re in labor, but Casey Wasserman just called!\u000a\u000aBut it is also more than that. These are the kings and kingmakers\u2014and during the campaign fundraising season, the president-electors\u2014who call Los Angeles home. (At least, primarily.)\u000a\u000aThese are the people who shape what it is we watch and listen to, what we stream and tweet about, as well as what we wear, where we want to go, and what we talk about when we get there.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve got art benefactors, politicians, sports and real estate moguls, fundraisers and technological visionaries.\u000a\u000aTheir selfies can alter a stock\u2019s future.

aV\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s drizzling rain outside when I meet Ashley Eckstein, the actress who voices the fan favorite animated Star Wars character Ahsoka Tano and founder of the rapidly growing geek girl fashion line Her Universe. But inside Alice\u2019s Tea Cup\u2014her suggestion for tea, scones and restorative afternoon treats\u2014we\u2019ve found a cozy sanctum. Up a colorful rickety staircase, and beneath a glowing chandelier, I\u2019m greeted by Eckstein, who is donning one of Her Universe\u2019s newest designs: a fitted jean jacket embroidered with the Star Wars credo across the back, \u201cMay the Force Be With You.\u201d While Eckstein is only in New York briefly before heading West to check out the new Her Universe offices in Los Angeles now that the company has been acquired by retail giant Hot Topic, and then flying back East to her home in Florida, she happens to be a devoted Alice in Wonderland fan, and so there\u2019s always time for a tea party.\u000a\u000aHaving trouble finding a women\u2019s Star Trek t-shirt, or perhaps a Doctor Who hoodie that is not pink? Her Universe has you covered. The company began as a small t-shirt business in 2010 and has since evolved into an online fashion destination for affordable, diverse and refreshingly chic fan gear for women. Eckstein started Her Universe shortly after she began her voice work as Ahsoka Tano, when a personal search for Star Wars clothing to celebrate her new role left her with unsettlingly few options.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt really started honestly from a selfish place: What would I want? What would I wear?\u201d she tells me, as our tea arrives at the table. Early on, she set out to be different, and established a few rules that have become the core of what makes Her Universe appeal to fangirls. \u201cI love the color pink, but in the beginning [I decided] there would be nothing in our line with the color pink. Female fans, they\u2019d kind of been treated like an afterthought. They would make 20 shirts for guys and one shirt for girls, and it would be in pink and it would say \u2018I Heart Star Wars.\u2019 We\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it, which was at the time unheard of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it.\u201d \u2014 Her Universe founder Ashley Eckstein\u000a\u000aAnd so, Eckstein embarked on an ambitious venture: to create an apparel market for female fans where there was none. She found a manufacturer to partner with, and sought out her first license with Star Wars from Lucasfilm. \u201cI think we started out with 9 t-shirts, and that was it,\u201d she says. As the company grew, it acquired licenses from the Syfy channel, Disney, Marvel, BBC and Studio Ghibli, and expanded its offerings to include sweaters, jackets, dresses, leggings and an accessories line. Browse the Her Universe website and you\u2019ll just as soon find retro-style shirts with Thor, Spider-Man and Loki as you will a black skirt decorated with rainbow lightsaber design and a red, yellow and blue Captain Marvel Jacket. The company\u2019s line is stocked with graphic tees, dresses inspired by characters like Boba Fett and Agent Carter, as well as plus size options and clothes for kids.\u000a\u000aTaking the leap from t-shirts to fashion, meant finding a bigger partner. In 2016, Her Universe became a subsidiary of Hot Topic, though Eckstein still retains full control of the company. The move, she says, has just allowed the company to do more. Today, Her Universe hosts an annual fashion show at San Diego Comic Con, has retail partnerships with brands such as Kohl\u2019s to create a line of activewear, and a publishing imprint. In just a few short years, Eckstein has helped make geek girl gear into an industry.\u000a\u000aFandom has been a part of Eckstein\u2019s life for as long as she can remember, she tells me. Growing up, her father worked for Disney, and her love of Star Wars has always been a constant. She moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and worked in film and television before landing what she calls her \u201cdream come true\u201d role voicing Ahsoka, the first female Jedi to lead a series in the Star Wars franchise, and who has helped pave the way for a new generation of strong female characters like Rey and Jynn Erso. But while women today are more visible in the sci-fi and fantasy world than ever (roughly half of Comic Con attendees are women, and a 2013 survey by Wired found that similar numbers applied to fans of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.) However, in 2008 when Eckstein began her work with the franchise, she found that female fans faced more discrimination and bullying than acceptance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought, this is no way to live your life. Being a sci-fi fan is literally a part of your DNA, it\u2019s a part of who you are. Like I said, to me, I love tea parties, I love Alice in Wonderland, I love cupcakes and I love Star Wars. It\u2019s just a descriptor of who I literally say I am\u2014it\u2019s not a trend.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo while Her Universe is primarily known for its apparel line, it\u2019s also become a tight knit community for fangirls, both online and at comic con conventions and fan events. Eckstein travels constantly, bouncing between her work as Ahsoka and being the public face of her company. Critical to her success has been staying active on social media. Today, Her Universe\u2019s Twitter account has 54,000+ followers, on Instagram 67,000 and the brand reaches across Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr and Snapchat.\u000a\u000a\u201cA big part of our strategy was to go grassroots\u2026to interact with the fans directly,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the girls think they\u2019re talking to me it\u2019s because they are, and it has been from Day 1. It\u2019s just me asking the fans, What do you want?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what they want, it seems, are options. \u201cWe need [designs] for different aspects of our lifestyle. When you go to work you\u2019re not just going to wear a big logo T. Maybe you\u2019re going to wear a blazer where it\u2019s just a black blazer on the outside, but the lining is lined with Delta shields.\u201d Her Universe now offers exactly that: Behold the open-front Trek Blazer, which is part of the new collection for ThinkGeek.\u000a\u000aWhile Her Universe designs offer wide appeal to the most casual and devoted fans (who doesn\u2019t love R2D2?), creating designs that will appeal to both isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cI did discover there\u2019s a difference between super inside designs that may speak to the hardcore fans, and then you have to offer a design that even casual fans will like to. If you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000aHer Universe may have opened the market for geek girl fashion, but it\u2019s no longer the only player in the game. Major companies such as M.A.C. cosmetics and Columbia sportswear have created Star Wars-inspired collections, and Rodarte hit the run way with a line of couture gowns. But Eckstein isn\u2019t intimidated by the competition\u2014far from it, she embraces it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for it because everyone always wants to strive for what they see on the runway, but not everyone can afford that $4,000 dress. So, then they come to companies like ours. We\u2019re known for being affordable fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more mainstream it becomes in fashion, it makes it more acceptable for girls to walk in to work and wear a Star Wars blazer, and for it to be acceptable. And that\u2019s what I want. [For] fans to celebrate their fandom.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow that geek girl has gone mainstream, what\u2019s next? Eckstein has some predictions: \u201cThe Superhero lifestyle and look is on trend. But also\u2014last year we saw it at the Met Gala and we saw it at the Her Universe fashion show\u2014is wearable technology.\u201d The winner of the 2016 Her Universe fashion show used thermochromatic pigment and heating tape to make the Marauder\u2019s Map from Harry Potter appear and disappear on a dress in the time it took to walk the length of the runway.\u000a\u000a\u201cYears ago that would have appeared very geeky in the fashion world\u2026now it\u2019s becoming couture,\u201d she quips. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m excited about that, I think that trend is just starting. We\u2019re seeing it on the runways, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that comes into everyday fashion.\u201d\u000a\u000aEckstein admits that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead before the pop culture world becomes an equal space for female fans and entrepreneurs. But in fashion, the geek girl revolution is well on its way.

aVIn 2016, boosted by Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 performance in the Democratic primaries, Law Professor Tim Canova managed to receive 43 percent of the vote in a closed Democratic primary against former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who received support from President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton. Canova was Wasserman Schultz\u2019s strongest primary opponent since she was first elected to Congress in 2004. Since winning reelection, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s popularity has continued to dwindle, and Canova announced he is challenging her in the primaries again in 2018.\u000a\u000aThat isn\u2019t the end of her worries: A prominent Florida Republican Attorney, Carlos J. Reyes, announced he will challenge her in the general election, making 2018 the first time she has faced a credible Republican opponent. In 2016, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Republican opponent received over 40 percent of the vote, her closest general election race yet. Reyes was appointed to the Memorial Healthcare System Board by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in 1999 and has the ability to fundraise at least $1 million in his bid against Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz has been engulfed in scandal throughout her tenure in Congress. Most recently, she has faced scrutiny over the arrest of her former IT staffer, Imran Awan, who was detained for bank fraud before trying to leave the country while under an investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, and U.S. Capitol Police for equipment and data theft. Despite Awan and four other IT staffers being denied access to congressional servers in February 2017, Wasserman Schultz continued to employ Awan up until his recent arrest. A variety of issues have risen from the investigation, including alleged smashed hard drives from Awan\u2019s apartment confiscated by the FBI. Wasserman Schultz claimed a laptop Awan hid in a crevice of a congressional building was \u201cmisplaced.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Politico reported that many Democrats wanted to remove Wasserman Schultz from DNC chair: \u201cThe perception of critics is that Wasserman Schultz spends more energy tending to her own political ambitions than helping Democrats win. This includes using meetings with DNC donors to solicit contributions for her own PAC and campaign committee, traveling to uncompetitive districts to court House colleagues for her potential leadership bid and having DNC-paid staff focus on her personal political agenda,\u201d the report stated. \u201cShe\u2019s become a liability to the DNC, and even to her own prospects, critics say.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the Democratic primaries in 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2018 supporters criticized Wasserman Schultz for organizing the primary debates to benefit Clinton. Throughout her four-year tenure as DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz oversaw drastic losses across the board for Democrats, and her poor leadership contributed to a rift within the party that still remains today. Some Sanders supporters blame Wasserman Schultz for Donald Trump\u2019s election.\u000a\u000aDespite her long record of being poison for Democrats, the Clinton campaign rewarded Wasserman Schultz with an honorary chair position on its 50 State Program. Since Clinton\u2019s loss, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s ally, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, has elevated her as a Democratic Party spokesperson. Whether or not Wasserman Schultz will prevail in her upcoming re-election challenges remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a liability Democrats would be better off without.

aVOf the cancers that afflict both men and women, one that has a far higher occurrence in males is bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in the United States and is also considered one of the 10 deadliest. As with all types of cancer, early detection could be vital for survival. Here are the basics of bladder cancer and the signs and symptoms you should be on the lookout for.\u000a\u000aWhat is the bladder?\u000a\u000aA hollow organ in the pelvis, the bladder is a holding reservoir with a primary function to store the liquid that drains from the kidney through tube-like structures called the ureters. As this urine trickles from the kidneys into the bladder, the bladder will gradually stretch and expand to hold the urine until it\u2019s ready to be expelled from the body. The bladder can hold up to about two cups of urine.\u000a\u000aWho is at risk?\u000a\u000aMen are about three to four times more at risk of developing bladder cancer than women, and the average age of diagnosis is at 73 years of age. According to the American Cancer Society, the disease is uncommon before age 60, as nine out of ten people with cancer of the bladder are over the age of 55. It steadily increases as a person gets older. Additionally, Caucasian men seem to be at an even greater risk, being two times more likely to develop the disease than African American men.\u000a\u000aWhat are the risk factors?\u000a\u000aPinpointing the exact cause of any cancer is difficult, as cancers are caused by varying combinations of genetic and environmental factors. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes that increase the risk of bladder cancer. It appears to be influenced by oncogenes stimulating malignant transformation of cells and then tumor suppressor genes mutating and losing the ability to claim their role of fighting off cancer cell growth. Some of the possible environmental risk factors include:\u000a\u000aCigarette smoking. Smokers inhale toxins absorbed into the bloodstream and then excreted by the kidneys into the urine.

aVThe anti-diversity memo from Google software engineer James Damore has set off shockwaves in Silicon Valley over the past week. Damore\u2019s treatise on \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber\u201d accused the company of creating \u201ca politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.\u201d It also claimed that \u201cmen and women biologically differ in many ways\u201d and \u201cwomen generally (have) a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up and leading.\u201d\u000a\u000aWomen in tech have heard all this before\u2014as we\u2019ve reported numerous times, females in Silicon Valley have to deal with sexism, harassment and lower pay than their male counterparts.\u000a\u000aBut this time, Google had enough\u2014Damore was fired yesterday.\u000a\u000a\u201cPortions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. \u201cOur job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile this move was widely cheered, many conservatives on social media felt differently\u2014they said Google was squashing \u201cdiversity of opinion.\u201d Julian Assange even offered Damore a job at Wikileaks.\u000a\u000aOthers tried to use the site\u2019s search results as proof that it \u201chates whites,\u201d noting that a Google image search of the phrase \u201cwhite women with children\u201d brought up images of interracial families. As such, they dubbed the search engine \u201cGoolag.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot content solely to lob insults at Mountain View, however, the social media hordes then began targeting individual Google executives. The replies to Pichai\u2019s most recent tweet, from July 28. are filled with people calling him \u201cthe authoritarian iron fist behind a rainbow glove.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut that was mild compared to the hate lobbed at Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s vice president of diversity, integrity and governance. Brown just started at the company in June, but she was thrust into the public eye as a result of Damore\u2019s memo.\u000a\u000a\u201cChanging a culture is hard, and it\u2019s often uncomfortable,\u201d Brown wrote in an internal email. \u201cBut I firmly believe Google is doing the right thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome people on social media thought Brown didn\u2019t go far enough in her comments. Any legitimate criticism was overshadowed by social media hate, however\u2014trolls claimed Brown was \u201ca thought police Nazi\u201d with a \u201cJew nose.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut of course, no one went further than Jack Posobiec. The alt-right activist, who gained infamy in June after he disrupted a Trump-inspired performance of Julius Caesar in Central Park, accused Brown of following only \u201chardcore liberals and RINOs like McCain\u201d on Twitter (RINOs, or \u201cRepublicans in Name Only,\u201d are people the far right considers insufficiently conservative).\u000a\u000aPosobiec also said Brown attempted to hide her work for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign\u2014never mind that Brown mentions phone banking for the Arizona Democrats in multiple tweets.\u000a\u000aMost absurdly of all, however, Posobiec said Brown showed her liberal bias by following Alt-POTUS 45, a satirical account which imagines what Hillary Clinton would tweet as president. Posobiec referred to the account as \u201cprofane\u2026alternative facts.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot surprisingly Brown had enough at this point, so she set her account to \u201cprotected\u201d mode so users had to send a request before following her. Many Twitter users (high profile and not) have this protection in place, but Posobiec still took a victory lap, believing that he was the cause.\u000a\u000aPichai and Brown still have not publicly responded to the trolls.

aVSunday night\u2019s Game of Thrones was particularly explosive, but now that it\u2019s over it\u2019s time to once again look forward. So take this as your warning: possible spoilers ahead.\u000a\u000aAudiences haven\u2019t seen Gendry, the last living bastard of King Robert Baratheon and popular fan-fic future mate of Arya Stark\u2019s, since the season three finale. In that episode, Ser Davos saved his life and put him in a row boat headed to King\u2019s Landing. Legend has it he\u2019s still rowing to this day\u2026\u000a\u000aAfter four seasons, it\u2019s looking like Gendry will be making his long-awaited return to Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, the only reason we know that is because IMDB listed it on the page for next week\u2019s episode. So, yeah, not much of a surprise anymore, but what are you going to do?\u000a\u000aActor Joe Dempsie is listed as a cast member for the season seven, episode five installment \u201cEastwatch.\u201d Normally, HBO is a lockdown defender of all things spoilers. But they\u2019ve been focused on bigger issues lately, and clearly this bit of casting news fell through the cracks.\u000a\u000aGendry was a talented blacksmith in his King\u2019s Landing days, so some have theorized that perhaps he could stumble on the long-lost recipe for Valyrian steel. More realistic, though, is that he helps Jon Snow and company forge dragonglass weapons. Either way, his return should carry some significance with it other than, \u201cOh look, there\u2019s Gendry.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll find out on Sunday night.

aVBack in 2006, I used to work for a non-profit in Philadelphia that leased mini-vans to drive groups of people in the city out to jobs on big corporate campuses in the suburbs. They called it \u201cCommuter Options.\u201d A lot of the best employers had abandoned the city and set up shop in places that really couldn\u2019t be reached by the regional transit agency\u2019s trains, which meant that workers without cars in the urban core couldn\u2019t take jobs they qualified for because the commute was impossible.\u000a\u000aThe staff who ran the program (I had nothing to do with it directly) didn\u2019t have fancy algorithms or datasets to work with. They just made a lot of phone calls to companies to find workers who needed carpools, and they ran a lot of events to help unemployed city residents apply to suburban jobs. It was slow going, but eventually minivans full of workers were setting out from different neighborhoods every day to remote office parks.\u000a\u000aEight years later, Chariot launched a tech-infused version of a very similar program in San Francisco: find workers in urban transit deserts and get them to the places where the jobs are, thereby saving them a lot of time and probably money, too. Ford liked the idea, so it bought Chariot in 2016. Today it announced its third market, New York City.\u000a\u000aIn May, we reported on Chariot workers in the Bay Area joining the Teamsters union.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want to connect people more easily to where they want to go\u2014whether they need help making it to a transit hub or live in an area underserved by public transportation,\u201d CEO Ali Vahabzadeh said in a press release. It will begin in August with two pre-planned service areas in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at a flat cost of $4 per ride.\u000a\u000aAt a press event today in Manhattan, Vahabzadeh emphasized that its program has been approved by the relevant agencies so that workers can pay for rides out of pre-tax earnings, just like many do for their monthly subway passes.\u000a\u000aThat daily price runs a lot higher than even paying full price for the subway, but there are tens of thousands of New Yorkers who drive to work for one reason or another, and $160 per month is a lot less than most people\u2019s car payment, never mind insurance, parking and gas. The CEO said that KPMG has estimated every Chariot van takes 10 cars off the road.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to really re-envision what a commute should be like,\u201d Vahabzadeh said at the event. Now that it\u2019s part of Ford, it can experiment with how its Ford Transit minibus is set up. Do they want to rearrange the seats? Let them move? Add new entertainment features? Vahabzadeh calls this \u201cCX\u201d for \u201cCabin Experience.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe company has a lot more CX flexibility now. That said, it\u2019s probably going to hew closely to what Vahabzadeh told the San Francisco Business Times in 2015: \u201cAt the end of the day, a commuter wants to get to work quickly, reliably and affordably. Everything else is a distraction.\u201d\u000a\u000aRight now, Chariot really wants New Yorkers to download its app and start playing around. It hopes to crowdsource data about new routes to launch. It wants 60 Transit minibuses running through the city by the end of the year.\u000a\u000aIn ridesharing, it hasn\u2019t been riders that have made the news so much as workers, however. Drivers are not considered employees by the big ridesharing companies, and then when Juno launched in New York, promising a better deal, it reneged shortly thereafter, leaving many drivers feeling used. A lawsuit is underway now.\u000a\u000a\u201cChariot actually employs its drivers,\u201d Vahabzadeh emphasized at the event. He cited a 91 percent retention rate month over month. While acknowledging that many drivers in the tech economy have been frustrated, \u201cour employees say and act differently,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aDriving can be a weird job. Those doing it for Silicon Valley bus companies serving campuses like Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s find themselves navigating very weird split shifts, where they are stuck far from home between their morning and evening runs. Chariot workers do split shifts as well, Vahabzadeh confirmed, but if they are staying within New York City, it shouldn\u2019t be quite so disruptive to their lives.\u000a\u000aTech\u2019s stabs at transit have already changed cities.\u000a\u000aPhiladelphia bus riders\u2014served by the same transit agency that failed city residents with jobs in the suburbs when I was there\u2014have started making the occasional switch to Uber, Philly.com reported this week. These problems are very complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take everything\u201d to get the roads unstuck, Ford\u2019s Jessica Robinson told the Observer at today\u2019s event.\u000a\u000aFord has committed to untying the Gordian knot of urban traffic, as we\u2019ve previously reported. Robinson said Ford really looks at Chariot\u2019s vehicles as a platform. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other innovation that will come to the Chariot platform first,\u201d she told us. That could be new sensors, connectivity or amenities.\u000a\u000aIn particular, she looks forward to a more demand-responsive platform. Imagine if Chariot had enough users and vans that the routes changed a bit every day, depending on who was going to work and when? And if it could deliver similar service to big events, like sporting events and concerts? Not only would that deliver a really flexible commute for riders, but it would also take a ton of pressure off the city\u2019s clogged roadways.\u000a\u000aThat is, until robots start delivering toilet paper and pizzas and clog everything back up again.

aVWoodland Park Mayor Keith Kazmark is the latest Democrat to jump into the fray and attempt to unseat Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-11), the 22-year incumbent whose mainly Morris County district has become a priority for Democrats heading into the 2018 midterm election.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Kazmark announced an exploratory committee and said that he would likely make a final decision whether or not to enter the congressional race around Thanksgiving of this year. If he does enter the 2018 congressional race, Kazmark will face already-announced candidates former federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill and Freeholder John Bartlett in the primary. Assemblyman John McKeon announced on Tuesday that he would not be pursuing a run for congress despite initial interest in the position.\u000a\u000a\u201cOver the past couple of years I have come to realize and feel that we are not properly represented by our current congressman,\u201d Kazmark said of Frelinghuysen. \u201cAs we consider this run, I think we can provide that.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne reason for the uptick in focus on the 11th congressional district is a 2011 redistricting that brought parts of liberal Essex County\u2014 including Sherrill\u2019s hometown of Montclair\u2014 into the district. Prior to the redistricting, Woodland Park was part of the 9th congressional district, a Democratic-stronghold that includes left-leaning Paterson and is currently represented by Rep. Bill Pascrell, one of the strongest Democrats in the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore redistricting, we were represented by Congressman Pascrell and it is just a much different level of engagement and representation,\u201d Kazmark said. \u201cThe congressman\u2019s failure to hold town halls or engage with residents, his staff\u2019s lack of constituent services\u2014 a lot of that has just led me to be disappointed.\u201d\u000a\u000aKazmark, 39, lives in Woodland Park with his wife Lauren and their two children. Prior to his election as mayor, he served on the town council for nine years. He is also the municipal clerk and borough administrator in Elmwood Park, a nearby Bergen County town where Republican Mayor Richard Mola served for 45 years until his death in October. Kazmark says that the experience working closely across the aisle and as a mayor gives him strength moving into 2018. This November, Kazmark is running to reclaim his mayoral seat in Woodland Park, a position he has held for six years.\u000a\u000aAny Democratic challenger to Frelinghuysen is going to face an uphill fundraising battle in a challenge to Frelinghuysen, the privately-wealthy heir to the Procter and Gamble fortune and the chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. In the past, Frelinghuysen has not faced a significant challenge but this year activist groups in the district are mobilized. A group called NJ 11th for Change has been regularly holding protests outside of Frelinghuysen\u2019s office, calling on him to hold town halls and blasting him for his yes vote on the unpopular House Republican Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think any candidate that has been mentioned this far will be a viable alternative,\u201d Kazmark said. \u201cBut as a small-town mayor, I genuinely believe there is no other position to better prepare you for office. You are held accountable every day, you are required to be responsive. If you\u2019re not, the voters are going to show you the door. Our congressman has been removed from the district to the point where he has fallen of the radar.\u201d

aVIf you ask Alison Brie, pro wrestling\u2014that confounding mix of live theater, improv, athletics and body oil\u2014can be summed up in three words. \u201cTuck your chin,\u201d she says, in the infectiously high-spirited voice that spawned a voiceover career to rival the Community and Mad Men star\u2019s live-action resume. \u201cTuck your chin, always. Or else you slam the back of your head. In more complicated moves, you can break your neck. So tuck your chin. It\u2019s the key to everything we learned.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow, exactly, did straight-A Annie Edison come to be an expert in safely slamming onto a canvas? The answer is GLOW, a new Netflix original from Liz Flahive and Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan that chronicles the rise in the 1980s of the real-life upstart organization known as the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (if you don\u2019t have time for Brett Whitcomb\u2019s stellar documentary, settle for this 15-minute montage of every G.L.O.W. wrestler\u2019s signature rap intro and remember to thank me later). Brie stars as Ruth, a struggling, out-of-work actress who finds purpose, and a steady gig, inside the squared circle.\u000a\u000aLike wrestling itself, GLOW is a lot of things at once. An ensemble comedy dressed up in spandex. A meditation on the strength of the female body. A look at what\u2019s changed about racism and sexism since the 1980s and, more importantly, what has remained exactly the same.\u000a\u000aHonestly, define GLOW how you\u2019d like. Just don\u2019t use the word \u201cfake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018Fake.\u2019 That is the biggest misconception about pro wrestling,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cSo many people have asked me \u2018but the ring is basically a trampoline, right?\u2019 No. No! It\u2019s planks of wood that have a little give with metal in between. I have such a deep respect for it now. For the athleticism, for the showmanship. I certainly get very defensive when people use \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018pro wrestling\u2019 in the same sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer voice drops, becoming far more Macho Man Randy Savage than Vincent Adultman. \u201cI\u2019m immediately like, \u2018I will take you down!\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat deep respect came courtesy of a four-week crash course prior to production that saw the entire cast\u2014including American Gods MVP Betty Gilpin and resident Mr. Robot hacker Sunita Mani\u2014learning lockups and back bumps from Chavo Guerrero Jr. of the generation-spanning Guerrero wrestling dynasty. It was, Brie says, as grueling as it was emotional; by the time production began, GLOW\u2019s cast was bonded by a shared desire not to drop a co-star on her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of wrestling is about working together, and nurturing your partner. Their life is in your hands as much as yours is in theirs. And there\u2019s a big leap between learning and \u2018now you just sort of have to do the moves,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cYou can only really talk through this stuff for so long until it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., flip over and land on your back.\u2019 There\u2019s really not a halfway version of that.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s another key thing,\u201d she continues, practically a seasoned ring veteran speaking to a rookie. \u201cCommitment in the ring. When you go halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the course our conversation it became clear that professional wrestling\u2014\u201creal\u201d or not\u2014has more in common with Hollywood than you would imagine. The bruises, the boiling down to barest stereotypes, even the occasional spandex requirement. If you go to become an actor halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u000a\u000aTo nab the role of Ruth in GLOW, Brie went anything but halfway.\u000a\u000aWhen Community concluded after six seasons (but no movie), the actress took a full year to read a pile of network pilots but finding nothing to pique her interest. \u201cA lot of the characters I was getting sent for network TV seemed very similar to parts I\u2019ve played before,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted different. \u2018Unique\u2019 was the main word I kept stressing to people.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe parallels to GLOW\u2019s Ruth\u2014an actress searching not just for work but also an identity change, saved by the sudden appearance of a wrestling show\u2014are uncanny, right down to the fact that the studio and producers wanted nothing to do with her. \u201cOf course, the show I\u2019d found and really wanted to do, they didn\u2019t want me for, at all,\u201d Brie says and laughs. \u201cIn fact, I think they were against it. Not only were they not certain, they were adamantly against me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they thought I was edgy enough,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve played these real apple pie characters. I look a certain way. I was looking to change the dialogue about the work I was doing, but they were not privy to that information. So they looked at my résumé and went, \u2018That is not what we\u2019re picturing.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aBrie disagreed. While GLOW\u2019s creative department saw Mad Men\u2019s Trudy Campbell and heard Unikitty from The Lego Movie, the actress herself had a different picture in her head, a fighter with big hair and bigger biceps similar to Sigourney Weaver in Alien (once Brie was cast, she actually did bring a photo of Ripley to hair department head Theraesa Rivers). And she fought. First, to simply get into the audition room, then across several follow-ups with producers Kohan and Flahive, a sojourn to Toronto to get on tape with Gilpin and a return trip Los Angeles for yet another round of auditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was like \u2018pre-read? Yeah! I\u2019ll be there. Anything. I\u2019ll record myself on tape. Whatever,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cI think at every point they could feel my desperation growing.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs luck would have it, desperation is a staple of Ruth\u2019s personality\u2014of every character on GLOW, in her own way. \u201cRuth is a person who was just tired of feeling invisible,\u201d Brie says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more like Ruth than while I was auditioning for the show. And they saw it. I\u2019ve heard [Liz Flahive] and [executive-producer Carly Mensch] say it: \u2018We were watching you transform into the character as you were fighting for the show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAs it turns out, the Ruth we get through GLOW\u2019s debut season could only be played by Brie, and the show would tell a different story without her. The actress remembers something Flahivi told her, before they had even met in person. \u201cShe said, \u2018this is a show about women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 \u201d Which is true; GLOW\u2019s cast runs the gamut\u2014color, size, shape\u2014of what a woman can look like. To position Brie, smallest of them all, at the center says a good deal about the relationship between a person\u2019s size and their capacity to stay strong.\u000a\u000aWhich didn\u2019t make the bumps feel better. But it helped.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wrestling really became all about fearlessness,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hesitate. You had to just make a decision and do it, do things that were very scary for all of us. But being forced to overcome those fears in an instant, essentially in front of a group of strangers, really empowered all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aSound advice, for anyone looking to leap into the rigorous trials of Hollywood or simply dive off the top turnbuckle. It\u2019s about fearlessness.\u000a\u000aJust remember to tuck your chin.

aVYou don\u2019t have to be 15 years old to know that memes are a dominant form of online culture right now, with the power to make or break politicians, to acquire millions of followers and introduce new words and themes into the lexicon. For a long time, memes have been either hobbies or the sort of accidental, anonymous creations of online communities. But today there is increasingly the breed of meme artist and influencer\u2014the type who can consistently produce ephemeral content that somehow becomes more than just ephemeral. One of the first people who has realized\u2014and seized\u2014the potential of the medium is Ka5sh, \u201ca professional meme-maker,\u201d as NBC News has called hm. Ka5sh has developed a fingertip feel of internet culture and has become one of the most influential, if not one of the better known, meme accounts. His memes have gone viral (with some exceeding 35,000 likes on his account alone), as well as videos approaching 200,000 views. Those might not seem like huge numbers, but he seems to be an influencer of the influencers, with many celebrity followers and influence over many other popular and more mainstream accounts.\u000a\u000aAs part of these series of interviewing the media manipulators and shapers of our online culture, I reached out to ask him more about what it means to be paid to create memes, what is the process behind creating them, his personal favorites, other meme accounts he likes, the unspoken rules of the meme world and much more. Enjoy.\u000a\u000aSo the news is out that you\u2019re \u201ca professional meme maker.\u201d Tell us how you got into this and about the moment when you thought, \u201cOh wow, I can actually get paid for this?\u201d\u000a\u000aHaha, yeah, it\u2019s sick I think!\u000a\u000aMemes are just micro content. I learned about making memes through my friend Alfred English, who was really popular as a meme maker on Facebook in 2014. He was making memes as micro content to promote his music, and I realized that I wasn\u2019t getting traffic to my page just promoting music, but if I posted memes, people would come to my page and then be more likely to listen to my music.\u000a\u000aI first got asked to make some content for a brand for their Instagram earlier this year, and I made like 3 memes for them and got paid. That was when I knew I never wanted to work a regular 9-5 again.\u000a\u000aFor people who have never seen your work before, are there a few favorites that you\u2019d show them? Are there any that they\u2019ve probably seen and wouldn\u2019t know were from you?\u000a\u000aHmmm, there\u2019s a bunch I\u2019ve made people have probably seen and don\u2019t know it\u2019s me because after awhile I stopped watermarking my memes. People would remake them and post them without my watermark and it would frustrate me so much\u2026especially when I\u2019d complain and people would say \u201cit\u2019s just memes\u201d, so I just stopped one day and it feels better to not care haha.\u000a\u000aI guess my favorite would be the whole \u201cI fuck with the vision let\u2019s link I\u2019m tryna build\u201d meme I did!\u000a\u000aEX:\u000a\u000aI'm starting a new format.

I\u2019m curious how that compares to the rush of making and releasing music.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s wild! It\u2019s so cool to hear a catchphrase you made or see a joke you made like all over the internet. I remember Pete Wentz was asking for a I Fuck With The Vision windbreaker. When a meme picks up like that, it can feel larger than life, but the internet moves so fast, that by the time a meme is peaking, I\u2019m already looking for new ideas.\u000a\u000aAnd in regards to rap it\u2019s not as fast. Memes are able to be shared at lighting speed because it requires no effort to share a meme. Music is a little different\u2014it takes time for it to go viral. The music\u2019s gotta make its way around all the different subcultures of the internet to reach as many people as a meme can with a few clicks.\u000a\u000aDo you have a sense for how these things spread? You have a lot of followers so I\u2019m sure that helps, but is there a particularly secret for getting your stuff going?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s all about knowing the trends\u2014knowing what\u2019s funny and what everyone collectively feels about certain things. Once you\u2019re on the internet for as long as I have been you start picking up on people\u2019s internet behavior and you\u2019re able to make jokes based on that, and see what trends are about to blow up\u2026.Or in my case I just make stuff I think is funny and just drill it into you until you think it\u2019s funny too.\u000a\u000aIs there a relationship between hip hop\u2014which is all about mashing things together, creating new words, new trends, and always evolving\u2014and this new world of memes and meme creation?\u000a\u000aThe relationship between hip hop\u2019s mashing things together and memes\u2019 mashing things together is definitely very similar\u2014especially with pop culture memes. Black people are making the jokes and formats of pop culture memes, just like in hip hop\u2014we\u2019re making all the cool dances and slang and songs.\u000a\u000aTalk to us about ownership and control and all that in meme creation because a few accounts like the Fat Jew have gotten in trouble obviously. My own dog has been featured on multiple well-known Instagram accounts for some reason. Are there general ethics you try to operate by? Are there unwritten rules?\u000a\u000aHahhah, woah, I\u2019ve seen your dog before! Sick!\u000a\u000aThere are definitely some unwritten rules \u2014 I\u2019ve been trying to get better with using actual people in memes. I used to go lurking in random people\u2019s Facebooks for reaction pictures because normal people are funny to me but I forget that these are still people and their lives are affected by these memes. I\u2019ve gone back to accounts of people I used in memes and seen them get cyber bullied to hell because of me using their picture for my joke, and that\u2019s not something I want to be a part of.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s also the unspoken rule in the meme world that you always credit if you can. Like, if you find a meme and it\u2019s got a watermark, just tag the original creator in it. And if someone asks to be tagged, just do it if it\u2019s their original content. Don\u2019t be like the Fat Jew just stealing everyone\u2019s shit. It\u2019s lame.\u000a\u000aIn this column, I talk to people who are extremely good at getting attention for themselves in today\u2019s media environment. For instance, you get hired by companies to create buzz around their clients. What have you learned that you think creators and agencies and companies are still way behind the ball on?\u000a\u000aI think all companies whose audiences are centered around teens and young adults should be hiring weird fringe internet kids to run their socials. Stop hiring some dumb post-grad who doesn\u2019t know anything about internet culture, and having them make corny cringe worthy content. Hire the people that are actually living their internet personas, and are innovating youth culture.\u000a\u000aAside from your own Instagram account, who are some meme creators who you\u2019d recommend and who inspire you?\u000a\u000aOooo this is always a hard one because if I leave someone out they will be pissed but if I forgot you, I\u2019m sorry ily.\u000a\u000aTWITTER:\u000a\u000aINSTAGRAM:\u000a\u000aYou recently had an art show. What is next for you? What projects are you excited about?\u000a\u000aI think I\u2019m gonna do more art shows. The last two have done pretty well \u2013 the first show, By Any Memes Necessary, was the first meme-focused art show ever, bringing internet memes into a tangible gallery format, and the second show, Peaches: A Black Internet Experience allowed me and my co curators, Brute Fact, to give a platform to 19 different Black artists and digital content creators, with the support of a Black Owned Business as a sponsor. Art shows have been allowing me to put on other people whose ideas and art I think deserves attention. It\u2019s been a way to create a real-life community around my ideas.\u000a\u000aI have more music coming out too. I\u2019m getting ready to drop a few pairs of singles over the rest of 2017.\u000a\u000aI also started hosting a party called Swipe Right. It\u2019s a monthly singles dance party I\u2019m doing with comedian Alison Stevenson. The idea is that it\u2019s a party to meet up with your Tinder date at, to make Tinder less weird, and less scary. (Tinder, if you\u2019re reading this, sponsor our party). I\u2019m also exploring opportunities acting, on reality TV (I have a TV show with VICELAND coming out this fall called Hollywood Love Story), and creating content both with, and for youth oriented brands.\u000a\u000aRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of Trust Me, I\u2019m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator.

aVRick Tyler, who appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show as a guest Tuesday morning, said that President Donald Trump should be on suicide watch after the release of recent poll numbers.\u000a\u000aThe on-air panel was discussing a new CNN poll that revealed a six-point drop in Trump\u2019s approval rating since April, a 38 percent overall approval rating (the lowest of any president after 200 days in office) and a 56 percent disapproval ratings. The poll also found that just 24 percent of Americans said they trusted the information coming from the White House.\u000a\u000aYou can hear what Tyler, a former Ted Cruz campaign spokesperson, had to say in the video below.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I were a political consultant looking at a candidate who had these kind of numbers, I\u2019d have him on 24-hour suicide watch,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThese numbers are not good. They don\u2019t look recoverable and by the way, the administration and the vice president can complain about The New York Times story, but we wouldn\u2019t have this story if the president\u2019s polls numbers were in the mid-50s, high 50s, or low 60s. Instead they\u2019re in the 30s.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio\u2026\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aTyler and the panel refuted Trump\u2019s recent claims that his support structure and base foundation is sound by noting the poll\u2019s results that 63 percent of the population say they were not proud to have the former reality TV star as president. According to the poll, 59 percent of Republicans said they strongly approved of Trump\u2019s performance, down 14 points since February.\u000a\u000aCo-host Joe Scarborough said that the \u201cbase is eroding\u201d and highlighted Trump\u2019s recent comments about crucial primary state New Hampshire. A separate poll carried out by the American Research Group indicated that if the New Hampshire primary were held today, Ohio Gov. John Kasich would be victorious over Trump, 52 percent to 40 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of these numbers look pretty tough,\u201d Scarborough said.

aV\u201cLook there\u2019s Anna Faris. She\u2019s always here!\u201d My friend Kelly nodded over to the dairy section of the Trader Joe\u2019s off Sunset in West Hollywood. Stars! They really are just like us. It was December in Los Angeles. Faris was inconspicuously shopping in a T-shirt and shorts, sans hubby Chris Pratt and their child. She was buying yogurt. No, I do not remember what kind, but I wanted to know. I wanted her celebrity diet secrets. What kind of milk does she drink? Is she buying dairy, almond or soy? So many questions. I would not be that person in the grocery store who would barrage a celebrity for diet secrets. So that was that, and there is my run-in with Anna Faris. Far from exciting, but humanizing to see her shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s. This was a woman who had good taste in food, and cared about saving money on groceries.\u000a\u000aI envy celebrity couples. Particularly the female counterparts of many of these matches, with their svelte figures and botoxed faces that look forever young in a natural, non-plastic way. I\u2019d love to be part of a power couple. I admire the actresses who have dared to get behind the camera, as Faris has. I\u2019ve always had a thing for Anna. She\u2019s underrated and has been for years. With producing credits for What\u2019s Your Number and The House Bunny, she\u2019s more than just an on-screen presence. More recently, with her podcast Unqualified and a forthcoming book of the same name, she\u2019s shown she\u2019s not just a pretty face. It was less than a year ago that she was live-tweeting Chris Pratt\u2019s day of preparation for the Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2 premiere. I wanted to vomit at the cuteness of it\u2014chronicling their seemingly normal, day-in-the-life routine for a red carpet night. With that adorable, archived moment stored online for the world to forever see, who could imagine that they\u2019d both be announcing the end of their relationship in coinciding social media posts just months later?\u000a\u000aPeople always seem to be in shock when a celebrity relationship doesn\u2019t work out. Most humans are in shock when their neighbors break up. This is mainly because everything seems so perfectly happy on social media.\u000a\u000aBut when I witness any breakups online, civilian or celeb, I\u2019m not surprised at all. No matter what their feed has ever led me to believe. I\u2019ve been there myself.\u000a\u000aOnly a few days before I left my ex, we had a witty exchange on Facebook. He posted something cute on my wall, I obligingly responded. I was on autopilot, and corresponding as I would to anyone.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to appear happy on the internet. It takes only a few seconds to \u201clike\u201d or post an affectionate photo. What\u2019s not easy is couples therapy, or dealing with the issues that can take months to work out.\u000a\u000aHave you ever seen a status update that has said: \u201cWeek eight: another day of therapy with George\u2026this may not work out.\u201d What about an Instagram post of an angry couple, post-fight? It\u2019s doubtful.\u000a\u000aIf anything, they\u2019ll share moments from happier times to overcompensate for what\u2019s lacking in real life. That is, right up until everything breaks, when people quite often go silent. In my flailing marriage, a little while before we ended things, I noticed my husband\u2019s more frequent habit of tagging me in photos from our happier times together, as if that would somehow magically solve our problems. The situation was sad. A happy emoji or picture couldn\u2019t make up for the emotions that were laking in our real lives. And it added to the appearance that things were fine, when they weren\u2019t.\u000a\u000aSocial media can become a tabloid about your friends\u2019 personal lives. Sure, we half fill it with political and celebrity dirt, but the most exciting kind of gossip comes from the people we know. One would sooner get-off on a Facebook post from a cousin announcing a breakdown than another installment in the saga of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian. Why? Because the cousin is far more relatable\u2014existing in our real lives. You can actually reach out and ask what happened, or your can get the dirt from your family if that\u2019s the kind of thing you thrive off of. Many do. But it can also be a way of knowing when to reach out, when to provide a caring ear for a friend going through something hard.\u000a\u000aSo I learned the hard way, by going through a breakup, how authentic to be with my online persona. I\u2019d say I\u2019m more transparent now, but also more careful about how much I share.\u000a\u000aBased on my past mistakes, I\u2019m hesitant to post anything on social media regarding any new romantic relationships I enter, at least for now. I know it\u2019s just fodder for gossip\u2014I\u2019d rather share that information in person. And now I also realize, things must be going well if I\u2019m not really concerned about posting at all. That means I\u2019m focussed on reality, rather than crafting some kind of story for the world to see.\u000a\u000aOne of the hardest things about modern day romance is how it all sticks around. You can\u2019t simply rip up the newspaper containing your wedding announcement like you used to after going through a divorce. We all leave internet footprints that many times cannot be erased. Post-divorce, as I was chatting with the man who wrote about my wedding ceremony for The New York Times, he brought up an outstanding point.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people ask for those wedding announcements to be taken offline when things go wrong, but that\u2019s what you deal with now. The marriage may not last forever, but the evidence of it will linger online.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese days, the information is there whether you like it or not. Last month Chris Pratt was tweeting about aloha shirts, and now he and his ex are tweeting about the end of their marriage. But their honesty seems like the right approach. Getting the truth out about the reality of what\u2019s happening can feel as if a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders. You no longer have to pretend. It\u2019s a relief when you can finally breathe and let the truth out, no matter how much you fear disappointing people or being the subject of gossip. Some will just talk, but for us non-famous folk, friends for whom this is news might also reach out to let you know you have support. Celebrities or not, breakups are not fun to go through, especially alone.

aVFormer DNC Chair Howard Dean has embraced his role of helping run Hillary Clinton\u2019s Super PAC, Onward Together, by punching left and insulting progressives.\u000a\u000aOn MSNBC\u2019s AM Joy, Dean said, \u201cThere has always been a section of the left, which I call the whiny party\u2014the party that doesn\u2019t really want to win. They just want to be pure, and if they go down swinging purely, then that\u2019s fine.\u201d Dean\u2019s childish insult is reminiscent of Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d and \u201cbasement-dwelling millennials\u201d comments during the 2016 election. What Dean perceives as \u201cpurity tests\u201d are simply progressives advocating for different issues than what Dean, an establishment puppet, deems important. The insult also deflects from the fact that Democrats have suffered drastic losses while operating on the establishment\u2019s brand of politics.\u000a\u000aDean personifies the Democratic establishment recycling their failures to preserve the party\u2019s power structure. Dean embarrassed the Democrats in 2004 during his infamous \u201cpyahhh\u201d meltdown that tanked his 2004 presidential campaign. Afterward, he was given the opportunity to rebrand his image as DNC chair and then subsequently left politics to serve as a senior adviser to a law firm\u2019s lobbying team.\u000a\u000aNow Dean is involved in setting up Hillary Clinton\u2019s new Super PAC, Onward Together.\u000a\u000aThe Super PAC, a hypocrisy since Clinton railed against the 2011 Citizens United ruling and big money in politics during her campaign, was set up as a 501c3, which allows it to shield its potential list of wealthy donors from having to be publicly disclosed.\u000a\u000aWhen she announced the Super PAC, Clinton cited five groups it would donate to and said that former DNC chair Howard Dean would help her run it. Progressives mocked the Super PAC\u2019s name, which is a rebrand of Clinton\u2019s unpopular campaign slogan, Stronger Together, which, according to the book Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign, Clinton didn\u2019t care much for either. Progressives began referring to the Super PAC as Owned Together, a play on words accusing that donors have purchased the Trump resistance movement by establishing a Super PAC predicated on leading it. The phrase stemmed from Jacobin editor Alex Press joking that she initially read the Super PAC as \u201cowned together,\u201d a more fitting name since the Super PAC\u2019s mission is to get voters to fall in line behind the party with unbridled loyalty.\u000a\u000aWhen Clinton unveiled the Super PAC, she claimed it would \u201csupport this wave of grassroots organizing,\u201d but nothing suppresses grassroots movements more than the involvement of corporations. Hillary Clinton and Howard Dean are not activists. To the contrary, they have established records of suppressing activism.\u000a\u000aAs the student body president of Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton stayed up all night on one occasion to discourage other students from protesting the Vietnam War. Hillary and Bill Clinton yelled at and scolded protesters who interrupted her at campaign events throughout the 2016 election. Instead of interacting with voters, Hillary preferred to host lavish closed door fundraisers.\u000a\u000aSince Donald Trump took office, Clinton hasn\u2019t organized or joined protests. Instead, she has reserved her public appearances to awards shows, private events hosted by billionaires and exclusive events with celebrities. She has announced lucrative book deals and returned to the highly paid speech market. When she has chimed in on social media, she has exploited Democrats\u2019 victories that she played no role in. Worse yet, her new Super PAC ensures that she will remain in the spotlight, undermining the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts in the process. All the while, Howard Dean chastises progressives for advocating to reform a flailing party.

aVFirst dates are a little weird for everybody, but the Superb Bird-of-Paradise may have the craziest first date in the animal kingdoms. This avian actually warps its whole body and dances so that it appears to be a giant, two-dimensional and slightly terrifying black and blue smiley face.\u000a\u000aIf the bird had only been recently discovered, it definitely would have been named the Emoji Bird, because when it transforms it looks like a bizarre emoji come to life.\u000a\u000aIn the video above from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, you can see a Superb spot a lady and gather up his feathers. He even has to use his beak to make it all work. By spreading out his jet black feathers in just the right way, all depth disappears from his body as light vanishes into them, as if he were a tiny, tiny black hole. Then, to keep the effect going, he hops right and left to make sure that the lady bird can\u2019t see him from any angle from straight on.\u000a\u000aEven better, scientists realized recently that a bird that they had thought was the same species is actually a second species. They could tell once they finally got recordings of the second bird\u2019s courtship dance. The birds only make these shapes when they are wooing ladies, so it can be tough to observe in the wild.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor centuries, people thought the Superb Bird-of-Paradise in the mountains of the Bird\u2019s Head region was a little different from the other populations throughout the rest of New Guinea, but no one had ever documented its display in the 200 plus years this bird has been known to occur there,\u201d Ed Scholes, a Cornell scientist, says in a post on the lab\u2019s website. Subsequent genetic studies confirmed the scientist\u2019s intuition.\u000a\u000aThe first bird scientists observed in New Guinea looks like a giant oval with a weird smile, while the newly discovered species from Indonesia looks much more stern\u2014at least, when he\u2019s getting his charm on. It doesn\u2019t always work.\u000a\u000aIn evolutionary terms, this is an example of sexual selection. When people talk about evolution, they usually focus on natural selection, the adaptations that allow creatures to survive and thrive. In truth, sexual selection\u2014traits that make a mate more attractive\u2014is also an extremely powerful force driving the shapes of species.\u000a\u000aStudents of evolutionary biology know that it\u2019s not at all unusual for species to exhibit sexual favor for traits that have no survival advantage\u2014for example, excessively large antlers on deer or widowbirds with such heavy feathers that it\u2019s hard to fly. Still, it beats being a male Anglerfish; males aren\u2019t even really distinct organisms in that especially depressing species.\u000a\u000aEvery bird-of-paradise has a unique shape it takes on during its mating ritual, which can be seen in video at the Birds-of-Paradise Project. They are all worth checking out, but the video above is the craziest.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s got to be a tough facade to keep up. Imagine how the man-bird feels when years later his bird-wife reminds him, \u201cHoney, I love you just the way you are, but I get super nostalgic whenever I think of that first time you warped your body into a giant two-dimensional smiley face.\u201d

aVThere\u2019s nothing quite like sleep away camp in the summertime\u2014just think about the bug juice, s\u2019mores and camaraderie. It looks like socialites, athletes and celebrities got to experience said companionship for themselves, only without the marshmallows. Celebrities and CEOs flocked to Google Camp last week, and according to Page Six, it was far more exclusive than even the most high end summer camp experience.\u000a\u000aSnapchat\u2019s CEO tech bro Evan Spiegel attended (without his wife, it seems, although it would have made for quite the honeymoon), alongside music business bigwig David Geffen, Prince Harry and Emma Watson (unclear if her entrepreneurial boyfriend, Princeton grad William Mack Knight, joined in). Sean Penn, Kevin Durant, Michael Hess and Dasha Zhukova were also spotted on the vacation.\u000a\u000aYes. I am standing. Kevin Durant. Google Camp, Sicily A post shared by David Geffen (@davidgeffen) on Aug 2, 2017 at 6:05am PDT\u000a\u000aGeffen posted a few Instagram photos offering hints of the other exclusive guests, which was strictly verboten. In fact, guests were encouraged to keep the trip private, especially on social media.\u000a\u000aEven though we now know who quite a few of the attendees were, the camp itself is super secret, but we can assume they\u2019re not singing \u201cKumbaya\u201d around the campfire. The retreat is hosted by Google at the ultra-luxe Verdura Resort, which definitely doesn\u2019t have any cabins. The all-stars spent three days talking about everything from public policy to the internet (okay, that part sounds like nights at camp, only minus the bunk beds). But it\u2019s not all about work; the actors, royals, athletes and tech royalty also attend wine tastings and undergo spa treatments. Guess they don\u2019t have much time for crafting friendship bracelets, but one can hope Prince Harry and Hermione found a connection.\u000a\u000aAnd on the last night, there\u2019s a concert at the Valley of the Temple. This year, Lenny Kravitz and Elton John performed, making for the ultimate social. Hopefully tube tops, straightening irons and glitter abounded.

aVMillennials have neglected The Catcher in the Rye for seventeen years, and it\u2019s time for a rebellion in the form of new interest and readership.\u000a\u000aFans of The Catcher in the Rye have cause to celebrate: Rebel in the Rye debuts this fall\u2014a biographical drama exploring events that influenced Salinger before he wrote the iconic novel. What makes the film exciting is that it\u2019s all about The Catcher in the Rye\u2014a book that has seen better days in terms of readership and cultural presence. The film, starring Nicholas Hoult as Holden Caulfield, has received early attention online. The buzz depicts high school English teachers as ecstatic.\u000a\u000aBut the greatest significance of Rebel in the Rye might be that it has broken a long near-silence regarding the novel\u2014in terms of positive comment, that is.\u000a\u000aMillennials famously dislike \u201cCatcher.\u201d They are the first generation to dislike Holden since the book\u2019s publication. They find him \u201cweird,\u201d whiny\u201d and \u201cimmature.\u201d (\u201cGet a Life, Holden Caulfield,\u201d The New York Times, 2009.)\u000a\u000aIn the 2016 Times Article \u201cWhy There\u2019s no \u2018Millennial\u2019 Novel,\u201d Millennial author Tony Tulathutte answers the question this way: \u201cThe \u2018voice of a generation\u2019 novel never existed to begin with. For starters, why did we ever pretend novels by straight white guys about straight white guys spoke for entire generations?\u201d\u000a\u000aTulathutte dismisses several books on the grounds of racial elitism, including The Sun Also Rises, This Side of Paradise, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and The Catcher in the Rye.\u000a\u000aAs a college instructor I have heard such logic countless times. A lot of Millennials challenge the legitimacy of the Western tradition, and therefore relieve themselves of the need to read anything at all, outside of their classes. Their ability to dismiss many thousands of books and art objects is one of the methods by which they remain innocent of art, literature, and history. And it\u2019s no use to tell them Gabrielle Garcia Marques, James Baldwin, Louise Erdrich, Jorge Luis Borges\u2014and many other great non-white authors\u2014were steeped in this tradition by their own choice and passion. The Millennial will look at you as if you were insane.\u000a\u000aAll exceptions granted! Of course, some Millennials I have met think independently and read by their own lights. These bright ones seem to dislike the relentless, unstudied judgments of their generation. Many are fans of Holden Caulfield, who likewise felt alienated by his moment.\u000a\u000aHolden is the best sort of rebel, to my mind\u2014a quiet individualist. Though angst-ridden and critical of the culture, he\u2019s intelligent, good-natured, and kind. He seeks out kindreds who see the world according to a singular vision, despite the influences of parents and teachers forever driving home the accepted program.\u000a\u000aIn his speech class, the students are taught to shout \u201cDigression!\u201d whenever a boy, in front of class, strays from the expected pattern.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut there was this one boy, Richard Kinsella,\u201d he tells Mr. Antolini, whose apartment he goes to when he\u2019s run down and needs help. \u201cHe didn\u2019t stick to the point too much\u2026They kept yelling \u2018Digression\u2019 at him the whole time he was making it, and this teacher, Mr. Vinson, gave him an F on it because he hadn\u2019t told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all. What he did was, Richard Kinsella, he\u2019d start telling you all about that stuff\u2014then all of a sudden he\u2019d start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle, and how his uncle got polio and all\u2026It didn\u2019t have much to do with the farm\u2014I admit it\u2014but it was nice.\u201d\u000a\u000aHolden burns to hear anything but the same cookie-cutter ideas that young people hear at school and elsewhere. He enjoys finding unusual people\u2014and children of all kinds. He loves his creative little sister, Phoebe, and a girl who asks him for help with her skate key, and a little boy who chooses to walk in the gutter instead of on the sidewalk where his family walks.\u000a\u000aWhat keeps his ample expression of fondness from the sentimental is the many remarks he makes elsewhere that are edgy and sometimes dark.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are always ruining things for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGrand. There\u2019s a word I really hate. It\u2019s a phony. I could puke every time I hear it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho wants flowers when you\u2019re dead? Nobody.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere we see Holden\u2019s whininess\u2014or \u201cnegativity\u201d\u2014so unpleasant to Millennials. It must have also shocked conservative young people of the 1950s, who were allowed to speak negatively only about communism and lazy people and so on. Similarly, Millennials can get angry about race and gender issues and the like, but a \u201cweird\u201d person speaking as an individual about what bothers him\u2014that\u2019s off limits.\u000a\u000aIn fact, Holden\u2019s criticism earns all the more trust because it\u2019s deeply personal. Though he\u2019s a child of a corporate lawyer, he never speaks in unison with his class. He has every privilege\u2014and insists on wearing ties and fitting in\u2014but risks his position by his behaviors, and certainly wants to avoid spending his life going up and down in elevators to some fancy job. Nor does he seize upon the ready truisms of a subculture. He\u2019s no beatnik or bohemian, though he\u2019s met with those and has neglected to emulate them. He articulates his own ideas, unafraid to stand alone\u2014an exemplar to millions throughout the world.\u000a\u000aThe rebellion of young people is essential to an open society that allows individual speech and difference. I predict the children of Millennials, even if they are few, will rebel like few other generations have. They will love The Catcher in the Rye.\u000a\u000aFor now we look forward to Rebel in the Rye hitting the theaters, and hope more \u201cCatcher\u201d interest is forthcoming\u2014more turning of those pages for the first time, more like-minded souls waking up in a sleepy cultural moment, and seeking in themselves what they believe, instead of doing as told.\u000a\u000aRyan Blacketter is the author of Down in the River.

aVIt\u2019s hard work making it to the top of your industry, but it\u2019s even harder work to stay there. So even after four studio albums, four mixtapes and 99 singles, Drake isn\u2019t slowing down.\u000a\u000aPerforming at his OVO music festival in his hometown of Toronto, Canada on Monday night, the hip-hop artist announced that he\u2019s hard at work on a new album, MSN News reports. His most recent album, Views, was a massive success with more than 1.6 million records sold in the U.S. alone, according to Billboard. Following that up will be a challenge, but Drake didn\u2019t appear to be phased by the pressure.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m going to go back to making this new album in Toronto, just for you,\u201d he told the audience.\u000a\u000aThe announcement comes after Drake released his new track \u201cSigns\u201d in June for fashion brand Louis Vuitton at the Spring/Summer 2018 catwalk show in Paris, per the outlet. No word yet on when fans can expect the new album to drop.\u000a\u000aFollowing Views, Drake helped fans get their fix with the mixtape More Life. Within 24 hours of its release, it had generated a staggering 89.9 million streams around the world on Apple Music, a new record, according to MSN. On Spotify, More Life broke Ed Sheeran\u2019s record with 61.3 million global streams in its first day.\u000a\u000aDrake, 30, has been steadily producing hits since his professional debut in 2006. All four of his studio albums have sold at least 1 million records domestically. Will this new album continue that streak? Stay tuned.

aVThe internet has found a way to put a price on dreams, and the market is strong.\u000a\u000aEntrepreneurs have been making an end run around the traditional path to financing startups by raising money with initial coin offerings (ICOs) aggressively. In April, The Economist counted $250 million raised for projects from mining to betting prior to April. Since then, Bancor raised about $147 million for digital financial instruments. Tezos raised $232 million for an Ethereum alternative.\u000a\u000aWe have written about a few ICOs here (and folks have tried to convince us to write about at least eight more so far this month). Brave dropped the Basic Attention Token to fix online advertising. BitBounce will spam the world with Credo. Blockstack will probably release some kind of coin to work within its browser. And Filecoin, the cryptocurrency for cloud storage, will launch its ICO on July 27 [UPDATE: Now August 7]. None of these endeavors have been undertaken by proven companies, though.\u000a\u000aThe first mainstream venture with some miles under its feet to sell a cryptocurrency will probably be Kik, Canada\u2019s unicorn messaging app. Before long, it will release a cryptocurrency called Kin, which it hopes will allow it to turn part of its billion-dollar valuation into spendable cash-money-dollars. If it works, Kik will have shown a way to let people \u201cinvest\u201d without diluting any of the prior investors\u2019 ownership stake.\u000a\u000aWhich is pretty weird.\u000a\u000aKik\u2019s Kin provides us with a chance to explain and explore the evolving world that bitcoin and its derivatives has wrought. It\u2019s going to get pretty abstract, because money itself is an abstraction, but one with very real world effects.\u000a\u000aWhat is Kik and why does it matter?\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re not a cool teen, you can be forgiven for not knowing about Kik. Kik started as a messenger, launching in 2010. In a conversation with Techcrunch\u2019s Jon Russell in China, Kik founder Ted Livingston took credit for basically everything about chat apps that has made them dominant forces on mobile. Americans virtually live on Facebook Messenger and in China, WeChat nearly equivalent with the internet itself. But Livingston says it was Kik that was first to see chat as a platform, layering on bots, communal events and branded pages.\u000a\u000a(The only big innovation that Kik may not be able to claim a piece of is Stories, which is Snapchat\u2019s, and Kik might be the only messaging platform that hasn\u2019t ripped off the popular feature.)\u000a\u000aDespite its innovations, \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to monetize in the Western world,\u201d Livingston tells Russell, because web giants like Facebook and WeChat owner Tencent \u201cgo ahead and give everything away for free\u201d because they can monetize with spying and ads.\u000a\u000aBut Livingston believes Kik can create an economy on (and maybe off) its app, one that rewards developers and users for contributing value to the community. It\u2019s building a system that will watch contributions made to the Kik platform and pay their makers out of its new pool of cryptocurrency for the good stuff they build based on how much activity it generates. Where will that cryptocurrency come from? Well, the Kik team will just make it out of thin air. That\u2019s the beauty of this day and age.\u000a\u000aOr maybe the better word to use is \u201cmoment?\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, what is money anyway?\u000a\u000aFirst of all, we\u2019ll set aside any boring legal issues here. Honestly, if digital money proves to be as valuable as some expect, the law will move to catch up. So forget the law. It\u2019s boring anyway.\u000a\u000aBut can you really just make money out of thin air?\u000a\u000aHonestly, it\u2019s kind of the only way that humans have done it for a long time. First we traded actual stuff (eggs for leather, etc). Then we traded stuff that everyone wanted and was easy to trade (silver, gold, etc). Then we traded tokens that represented commodities like silver or gold (until the 70s, 35 U.S. dollars were exchangeable for an ounce of gold ). Then we just traded the tokens backed by little more than the faith and good will of governments, with names like euros, francs, pesos and dollars.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a bit fuzzier than that. For example, the US Congress requires dollars to be backed by some sort of asset, but that\u2019s mostly just notes on government debt (US Treasuries). At the end of the day, any currency\u2019s value mostly comes down to faith in the nation that originated it.\u000a\u000aThis faith-based cash is \u201cfiat money,\u201d and it\u2019s often referred to derisively among cryptocurrency types. \u201cFiat\u201d is a Latin word for \u201clet it be,\u201d because fiat money is just willed into existence by a nation-state, which also decides how much of that money there is in the world at a given time. Cryptocurrency really isn\u2019t any different, except all it takes is a developer and some server power to make a new one.\u000a\u000aMoney works kind of, sort of like stock in a country\u2019s economy. If you want to visit Baltimore or invest in Ford or buy New Balance sneakers in bulk, you need US dollars to do it. So if people around the world want that stuff, they trade their own currency for dollars, and that increases the price of the dollar versus the yen or the euro or the ruble, none of which have the state of Maryland, the US auto industry or worker-friendly kicks.\u000a\u000aSo in that way, it is like a stock, in that its value changes as the winds of fate blow across the nation that originated the currency, but it\u2019s not like a stock (or \u201cequity\u201d) in that a nation\u2019s currency doesn\u2019t inherently entitle its bearer to, say, input in its legislature, a chunk of land or even an actual vote in an election.\u000a\u000aICOs as investments\u000a\u000aAnd here\u2019s where we get into how an ICO is so different from traditional forms of fundraising. Normally, when a company wants to raise money, it sells a piece of itself (in the form or equity). So if you hear that a company raised $100,000 at a million-dollar valuation, that means it just sold 10 percent of the company to some investor. It\u2019s pretty simple.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not how an ICO necessarily works. Most ICOs these days have created money to be used on some platform. Just as the US government has said that business in our borders has to be conducted in dollars, Kik has the power to say that people who want to trade on its platform need to use Kin to do it. So Kin will work for Kik much like the dollar does for the U.S.\u000a\u000aJust as the dollar reflects how much people want to do business here, Kin will reflect how much people want to do business on Kik. Similarly, just as people who believe the US economy will grow buy and hold dollars to reflect that confidence, people can also invest in Kik by buying Kin, out of a belief that Livingston\u2019s gambit will work.\u000a\u000aBuying Kin does not mean, however, that the currency\u2019s owners hold any rights to Kik. That\u2019s why we put scare-quotes around the word \u201cinvest\u201d when we first mentioned the currency.\u000a\u000aKik is setting aside 30 percent of all Kin for itself (but only letting itself get access to it in chunks over about three years). The idea is that if all this works then the value of that pool will increase. People with a stake in Kik who get Kin out of that pool can hold it or sell it as they see fit. If the Kik economy really takes off, then Kik\u2019s owners should be able to get a nice payday.\u000a\u000aRussell asks Livingston: And then what? If Kin has a hard cap, then how will the company monetize its big expensive platform after their Kin is gone?\u000a\u000aLivingston dodges the question.\u000a\u000aSo where does this all end up?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not as if private entities haven\u2019t made up their own money before. Usually it happens when the existing form of money doesn\u2019t work well in some piece of the economy. Dollars and yen create a lot of friction online for the applications founders are inventing today.\u000a\u000aWant to buy a cool sticker from someone for about a penny? Forget it. You can\u2019t.\u000a\u000aWant to let people buy tickets to a group chat with a celebrity in a way that they can do it on an impulse? It doesn\u2019t work right now.\u000a\u000aBut fiat money could catch up. If governments issued cryptocurrencies, it would become tough to justify more ICOs. So that\u2019s one possibility.\u000a\u000aBut even if that doesn\u2019t happen, there is also a chance that so many new coins get created that it drives the price of all cryptocurrency down to zero. At the end of the day, all crypto is the same thing: a weird piece of nothingness that only one person can hold at a time. It works as a medium for trade. So even the Useless Ethereum Token has a use. It can be used to buy other cryptocurrencies.\u000a\u000aThe Harvard of startup accelerators, Y Combinator, recently brought in Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO of cryptocurrency investor Polychain Capital, to talk about investing in these new coins. YC staff ask Carlson-Wee why these new startups create new currencies for platforms, such as Brave\u2019s for ads or Filecoin\u2019s for cloud storage.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think there is no strong reason from a technology standpoint,\u201d Carlson-Wee says. \u201cIt\u2019s really more a game theoretic reason.\u201d\u000a\u000aBesides bringing in cash, luring in a bunch of speculators has a way of turning them into users. Online products tend to be better when more people use them. So by drawing in the avaricious, firms can use ICOs to hack their way ahead on scale.\u000a\u000aKik could run just as well on Ethereum proper as on an Ethereum-devised cryptocurrency, with one very important difference: Kik\u2019s vision is to pay independent developers to build new stuff for Kik, but it doesn\u2019t actually have enough cash to pay them (which it would need if it were to pay in Ethereum\u2019s money). Instead, it plans to pay them in a made-up money and hope that money\u2019s value grows enough to make developing for Kik and getting paid in Kin worthwhile.\u000a\u000aBut outside of Kik, Kin will be just another token, inherently no better or worse than bitcoin or BAT or Filecoin. Beyond whatever platform that created it, it\u2019s all just digital money. Right now, the differences between them seem very important, but the more mainstream this stuff becomes, the less important those differences will be, just as the differences between basketball shoes are a big deal to sneakerheads and just shoes to everyone else.\u000a\u000aIf entrepreneurs just keep making new supplies of digital money, the global market could start treating it all as if it\u2019s all basically the same, driving the price of all of it down together.\u000a\u000aIn the worst case scenario, digital cash could become so plentiful that the only thing stopping a kid with some coding skill from creating a new token will be the fact that it isn\u2019t worth his time; however, any time the market calms enough that the economic growth restores some value to existing tokens, it could just be arbitraged out by someone who sees it and creates a new one.\u000a\u000aTrue, the supply for any one digital token can be constrained, but the supply of all digital tokens is infinite and that reality could become a real problem for companies offering coins to power what could be really useful systems.\u000a\u000aWe asked several investors known for backing this space if their teams had discussed this scenario, but we were met with silence.\u000a\u000aSo is this whole sector doomed?\u000a\u000aThat is unlikely.\u000a\u000aThe top seven cryptocurrencies in the world right now have a combined value of $80 billion. That\u2019s a long, long way from zero and it buys the sector a ton of time (especially because it will probably go up much more before it goes down). The analysis in the section above is based on an assumption that nothing else changes. Of course things will change, but we have no idea how.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re headed into Web 3.0, a new era of the internet characterized by mobile connections that will make today\u2019s wired connections look slow, three-dimensional websites, connected devices with super-brains, browsers loaded up with money and UN Secretary General Jeff Bezos.\u000a\u000aNo one in 1993 would have heard a description of Snapchat and believed it could be a $17 billion company one day, but here we are. People are going to come up with some crazy new applications for how that future works, and there\u2019s a decent chance the internet will find some technical consensus that constrains the issuance of digital money in a way that preserves its usefulness (that is, tokens\u2019 value).\u000a\u000aAnd the solution will probably be weird and nearly impossible to anticipate, and that\u2019s why people will keep proclaiming that \u201cbitcoin is dead\u201d over and over until that solution is found.\u000a\u000aAnd entrepreneurs will look back longingly on this era as an online belle époque, when money could be spun up on a server and used to buy real Lamborghinis (or at least rent a Ferrari) not long after. Kik will be one of the first established companies to create its own digital money. If history is any guide, Kik will then be copied. It might not happen many times, though, before the guests enjoying this particular online party find themselves at last call.\u000a\u000aCorrection: A previous version of the story described the US dollar as freely floating, without collateral.

aVThe Fox News Specialists just won\u2019t seem the same now that manly man Eric Bolling has been suspended amid allegations that he emailed penis pictures to women he worked with at Fox News Channel and Fox Business Channel.\u000a\u000aThe Specialists\u2014in case you\u2019ve missed its innocuous three-month run\u2014is a vacuous right-wing talk show at 5 p.m. on weekdays, anchored by Bolling and two women, Katherine Timpf and Eboni Williams.\u000a\u000aBolling, the most special among them, burps up hairballs like \u201cFake News!\u201d and charges like \u201cThe Washington Post and the New York Times, you should be ashamed of your reporting!\u201d\u000a\u000aShame, indeed. Three years ago, discussing how a female pilot led an air strike against ISIS, Bolling quipped about \u201cboobs on the ground,\u201d which might have been clever in a sexist way except that she flew an airplane and was, therefore, not on the ground, not even her boots.\u000a\u000aUntil now, he\u2019s been the hip dude on the Fox boob tube. A former commodities broker, Bolling likes to affect a hunky, rugged look on air, rarely wearing a necktie, his collar unbuttoned, his air dismissive, above it all, too cool for school.\u000a\u000aHis show got thrown together in a sudden schedule shift in April after Fox superstar Bill O\u2019Reilly resigned due to sexual harassment allegations.\u000a\u000aO\u2019Reilly was no longer protected by Fox Emperor Roger Ailes, who resigned due to sexual harassment allegations months before and recently died. And who to protect poor Charles Payne, another Fox anchor, currently suspended amid allegations of sexual harassment?\u000a\u000aBolling, it has been reported, was being considered for a post in the administration of amateur President Donald Trump. He has also threatened to run for U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000aBolling would be perfectly qualified for Trump because he talks rough and tough about liberals and Democrats, just the way Trump likes it on Fox, just like Sean Hannity, Fox\u2019s leading Trump fluffer, who dines with Trump in the White House and whispers in his ear.\u000a\u000aRemember way back when Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s career as White House communications director ended after less than two weeks? That was because Scaramucci went crazy over a leak about a White House dinner involving Trump, Hannity, Scaramucci and Bill Shine, who used to help Ailes run Fox News.\u000a\u000aAmong other things, in his quest to discover the leaker, Scaramucci told The New Yorker that Trump senior advisor Steve Bannon fellates himself. (What other photographs might Bolling have for the gals at work?)\u000a\u000aAnyway, Shine was the guy who resigned this spring because he was right in the middle of the hound-dog pack of Ailes, O\u2019Reilly, Payne and Bolling and didn\u2019t seem to see any problem. Perhaps Trump, who brags about grabbing women by the crotch, might find a place in his administration for Fox guys like O\u2019Reilly, Shine, Bolling or Payne.\u000a\u000aOne of them could replace Scaramucci and Sean Spicer as White House director of communications. Or that job could go to 31-year-old adviser Stephen Miller, the brightest young fellow on Earth, who pleased Trump so much last week with his TV performance in the briefing room when he berated reporters from the New York Times and CNN. For good measure, Miller also trashed the Statue of Liberty.\u000a\u000aYes, days after Sports Illustrated quoted Trump as having called the White House a \u201cdump,\u201d Miller\u2014in a figurative, verbal sense\u2014urinated on the Statue of Liberty by dismissing its poetic message of immigration for the tired, the poor, the huddled masses, and the refuse of teeming shores.\u000a\u000aInstead, Trump has announced\u2014with Miller\u2019s help\u2014that legal immigration should be cut in half and reserved for more privileged people just like Miller! (Had Trump encountered Lady Liberty, who know where he might have grabbed her).\u000a\u000aWith his cobra eyes and his toxic tongue, Miller might be the perfect television image for Trump. Miller\u2019s got a Roy Cohn mien that must stir Trump\u2019s testosterone-charged blood. A sinister red-baiter from the blacklist era, Cohn was once Trump\u2019s lawyer and mentor.\u000a\u000aIf still alive, the manipulative Cohn might be delighted by the lawsuit filed last week by a detective who accused Fox News of conspiring with the White House to concoct a fake news story about a Democratic National Committee employee being murdered for giving DNC emails to WikiLeaks.\u000a\u000aAfter this vicious story slandered a dead man and horrified his grieving family, even the Fox website took it down because it was a lie. But Hannity, ever true to Trump, kept pushing it to deflect blame from the Trump ring and its dealings with Russian agents.\u000a\u000aEspecially in the case of Hannity, it is increasingly hard these days to tell where the Trump White House ends and Fox News begins. Perhaps when he returns vindicated from his suspension, Eric Bolling will explain it all to us on a special edition of The Specialists.\u000a\u000aA Fox Voice Worth Heeding\u000a\u000aCharles Krauthammer, a conservative commentator on Fox News Channel, is a psychiatrist and a first-rate political and cultural analyst who sometimes sees beyond the obvious. Such was the case with amateur President Donald Trump last week when Krauthammer diagnosed the social neurosis Trump stokes.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump\u2019s angry harangue to a loud mob in West Virginia on Thursday, Krauthammer visited Tucker Carlson Tonight to say, \u201cThis is a very important demonstration to the country, to the political elites, to the press, which he doesn\u2019t particularly like, that he has his army\u2026 This appearance\u2026 is a way of saying \u2018My numbers may be down, but I command a formidable army.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aBy \u201carmy,\u201d Krauthammer didn\u2019t mean the kind of armed forces once commanded by all those former generals who now work in Trump\u2019s administration. He didn\u2019t mean the people still in uniform (who Trump calls \u201cmy generals\u201d) who lead American troops in the field.\u000a\u000aKrauthammer was referring to Trump\u2019s chanting, cheering, booing supporters in West Virginia, like that bizarre guy behind Trump on Thursday, looking over Trump\u2019s left shoulder. He wore a red \u201cMake America Great\u201d cap, a black motorcycle tee shirt and tinted glasses.\u000a\u000aThis Trumpist clenched his fist and shook it and mouthed words as Trump spoke them, applauding exceedingly and grinning in a stagey way. It seemed almost as if somebody had placed this zealot near Trump to make a contrast that said \u201cSee, clearly, the president isn\u2019t nearly as nuts as his supporters!\u201d\u000a\u000aKrauthammer predicted that if Trump is impeached and removed from office, it may cause a backlash from the kind of people roaring for him in West Virginia. Although they may be only 33 percent of the population, this many people can make a mighty fuss.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s why I think we\u2019re really headed into very choppy and dangerous constitutional water,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cIt would be a catastrophic mistake. It would cause a rupture in the country where people would say \u2018When we, the people, the ones who have been abandoned, elect somebody we like, our guy gets taken out.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aKrauthammer put the circumstances of Trump\u2019s speech in the context of the investigation of Trump\u2019s circle and its possible involvement in the Russian espionage scandal in last year\u2019s election. He did not use the word \u201cdemagogue.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis whole speech was \u2018Russia closing in on me in Washington\u2014versus you, the people,\u2019\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he set it up. He\u2019s very good at this.\u201d\u000a\u000aObama said\u2014What?\u000a\u000aBill Maher\u2019s Real Time on HBO on Friday nights is a hit-and-miss hour. Its comic moments range from pretty witty down to what you might see scribbled on the wall of a men\u2019s room stall. His show on Friday ended with a brilliant bit featuring comedian Reggie Brown.\u000a\u000aBrown looks reasonably like former President Barack Obama and fills the character by imitating Obama\u2019s broad smile and slow, deliberate speaking cadence. For this skit, Brown\u2019s \u201cObama\u201d read words actually spoken by amateur President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aImagine, Maher said, if Obama had said them and not Trump. What, for instance, if Obama had said of Sen.John McCain, \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what if Obama had said of his military strategy, \u201cI\u2019m speaking with myself and, number one, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said a lot of things.\u201d\u000a\u000aImagine Obama saying something like, \u201cSorry, losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest and you all know it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd perhaps Obama might have been criticized if he had said, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d\u000a\u000aCriticized by right-wingers for not being a convincing Christian, Obama might have said, as Trump did, \u201cWhy do I have to repent and ask for forgiveness if I\u2019m not making mistakes?\u201d\u000a\u000aOf Holy Communion, Obama might have added, as Trump did, \u201cWhen I drink my little wine and have my little cracker, I guess that\u2019s a form of asking for forgiveness.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what if Obama\u2014not Trump\u2014had told Bill O\u2019Reilly before the Super Bowl, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?\u201d\u000a\u000aAt this point, Maher showed a gag image of Sean Hannity\u2019s head exploding. The next few lines were about Trump not knowing health care was \u201cso complicated\u201d and Trump bragging about inventing the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d and Trump thinking Frederick Douglass was still alive.\u000a\u000aIt ended, of course, with the Obama character speaking the words of Trump regarding Trump\u2019s serial sexual predation\u2026\u000a\u000a\u201cI moved on her like a bitch. I just start kissing them. I don\u2019t even wait. And, when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2018em by the pussy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2026And, of course, the size of his penis.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe referred to my hands. If they\u2019re small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there\u2019s no problem, I guarantee you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe effect is best with Brown heard and seen on the screen. It\u2019s all over the internet, Brown, as Obama, reciting Trump\u2019s words on Maher\u2019s show on HBO. And if Trump boycotts the White House Correspondents dinner again next year, they should book Brown as Obama and Alec Baldwin as Trump and put on a show for the ages.\u000a\u000aSunday Show Wrap-Up\u000a\u000aThe commentators on the pundit panel were harsh about the Trump administration. One warned that if Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller, \u201cMueller will be the lead witness in his (Trump\u2019s) impeachment hearing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe second opinion addressed Trump\u2019s feud with the intelligence agencies.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has a very dicey relationship with people who weaponize information for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still haunting him\u2026 He has to change his tone.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd the third commentator reflected on how John Kelly is trying to organize the White House as the new chief of staff.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat White House is a snake pit,\u201d the man said.\u000a\u000aWhat made the opinions so startling is that they were heard on Fox News Sunday, representing Trump\u2019s sanctuary network. The speakers were Rich Lowry of National Review, Jason Riley of the Wall Street Journal and Charles Lane of the Washington Post.\u000a\u000aAmong the other shows, not much stood out on what seemed almost like a normal, relaxed, August Sunday morning.\u000a\u000aOn ABC\u2019s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos tried to get Trump mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway to reveal which generals Trump spoke with before he impulsively tweeted out a surprise purge of transgender people in the military. She talked for 20 minutes but never answered the question.\u000a\u000aOn Media Buzz on Fox, host Howard Kurtz gave less than a minute to the Eric Bolling suspension but he had plenty of time for Trump advocate Katrina Pierson, who said, \u201cMost Americans got out there and actually voted for President Trump.\u201d Kurtz didn\u2019t correct her, so here goes: No. Actually, more Americans really voted for Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aAnd on Meet the Press on NBC, Chuck Todd welcomed Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is trying to distance himself from Trump with public interviews and a new book called Conscience of a Conservative.\u000a\u000a\u201cPopulism is a sugar high,\u201d Flake told Todd, referring to the Trump buzz. \u201cAnd, once you come off it, it\u2019s particularly troublesome for the party. I wish we had been more truthful with the electorate.\u201d\u000a\u000aFlake said Republicans \u201cshould have stood up to birtherism\u201d when Trump insisted, in 2011, that Obama was born in Africa and, therefore, not a legitimate president.\u000a\u000aAs for the \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d chants that Trump\u2019s worshippers still use for Clinton, Flake said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be the party for jailing your political opponents.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also said it might be good if Trump stops referring to top Democrats as \u201cclowns and losers.\u201d

aVNew Yorkers have always known their city is the center of the universe, so it seems only fair that New York ought to play such an unusually outsized role in this year\u2019s presidential race.\u000a\u000aSure, the city has always funded presidential campaigns and has always seen the candidates visit if only to meet with rich people from whom they would like money. But the state has rarely weighed in formally on the race with a presidential primary that was actually competitive\u2014and never has it had competitive primaries in both parties at the same time. Now, instead of meeting only with the monied class, the candidates are eating pasta in the Bronx and matzo in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aIf having the candidates campaign in New York City, with all its ethnic food and tabloid drama, wasn\u2019t enough, two of the candidates most likely to become the next president are New York residents.\u000a\u000aWith the star power of the presidential campaign in town, it seems even the city\u2019s biggest personalities\u2014its gangly mayor, its mercurial governor, its swaggering prosecutor and grinning police commissioner\u2014have taken a backseat to the action. The campaign is all anyone is talking about, including Mayor Bill de Blasio himself, who has been pining to be a go-to progressive pundit and favored surrogate of Hillary Clinton, with less-than-stellar results.\u000a\u000a(Indeed, Mr. de Blasio has been lucky that all eyes are on the primary: It has meant less attention is being paid to reported investigations of his campaign contributions and his administration\u2019s role in a controversial property sale.)\u000a\u000aThe 2016 race seems to swirl around nearly everyone, as New York Democrats jockey for favor with their old pal Ms. Clinton\u2014perhaps looking for appointments down the line\u2014and jockey for headlines bashing their hometown foe, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s power list has a decided focus, then, on the national figures who call New York City home, the local folks who help keep them in the running and the possibilities the future holds for those people\u2014and what it could all mean for everybody else in town.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Schumer, Senator\u000a\u000aMr. Schumer has been ravenously ambitious since his days as a pothole-filling assemblyman from Brooklyn. Now, as the anointed next leader of the Senate Democrats, with the Democratic Party facing favorable prospects in November, there\u2019s an excellent chance you\u2019ll be calling him Majority Leader Schumer in 2017.\u000a\u000aNew York has never had a majority leader, let alone one from the borough of Kings, and Mr. Schumer will cement his role as the Empire State\u2019s most important elected official. Our city has long struggled on the federal terrain\u2014urban issues just aren\u2019t sexy to Republican congressmen from the Ozarks\u2014but with Mr. Schumer as one of the most powerful elected officials in the country, we\u2019re bound to do a little bit better. No matter who becomes the president\u2014more on that later\u2014Mr. Schumer is one New Yorker who is assured a spot near the top of the heap in Washington.\u000a\u000aHe also arrives at a precarious time for his own party, even as Democrats gloat about the crackup of the GOP in the Year of Trump. The grassroots left, powering Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, is ascendant, and the centrist Schumer has never had a very comfortable relationship with the most liberal end of the Democratic Party. His defense of Wall Street and his ability to raise prodigious sums of money from the financial sector were once nothing but an asset. Mr. Schumer\u2019s rise to power came in part because he could raise cash as well as anyone in politics. Now, with angry progressives demanding purity from their Democrats, Mr. Schumer will have to figure out how to balance his own pragmatist instincts with a political environment that may be unfriendly to people like him. Does Mr. Schumer tack left? Or for the first time in his career, does he resist the political current?\u000a\u000a2. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State\u000a\u000aNot since Thomas Dewey challenged Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 have two New Yorkers\u2014one a mid-life arrival, the other native-born\u2014vied against each other for the White House. And while Ms. Clinton\u2019s democratic socialist primary opponent, Mr. Sanders (a son of Brooklyn himself), may have a few rounds left in him, her nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate is all but assured, assuming nothing comes of her email scandal. Voters remain lukewarm to the ex-secretary of state, but New York\u2019s political elite has scrambled to hoist the former Empire State senator onto their shoulders. The names of her top surrogates in the city dot this list, and some could easily wind up in her administration should she triumph in November. A polarizing figure, Ms. Clinton could have the good fortune of facing an opponent this fall whose unfavorability ratings outstrip even her own.\u000a\u000aAbout that opponent. Mr. Trump, too, is a New Yorker who could be the next president. But truth be told, his influence in this town seems largely relegated to being the target of ire from Democrats, who see a win-win in criticizing a candidate so deeply disliked by so many, even as he is beloved by those who show up to his rallies and to vote for him. It\u2019s unclear yet whether Mr. Trump has shattered the Republican Party or revitalized it, or whether his campaign will be little more than a passing spasm of anti-establishment outrage\u2014and as such, the extent of his true power as a player in New York City remains unclear, too.\u000a\u000aThis list will go to press just hour before some of these open questions will be answered in our state\u2019s primary. If Mr. Trump cracks 50 percent in his hometown, it\u2019ll boost him toward the convention and argue he can be competitive in the northerast in the general. An under-convincing win here will be rough for Ms. Clinton, but if she can win by 10 or more points she\u2019ll keep surging toward November.\u000a\u000a3. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney\u000a\u000aAll pols fear the probing, sardonic eye of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District. After falling heavily last year on the two most powerful legislators in the state, ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and former State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, it seemed to pass over Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2014though the prosecutor is still reportedly peering into potential sweetheart contracts for donors in Buffalo.\u000a\u000aNow Mayor Bill de Blasio and his NYPD are in the anticorruption evangelist\u2019s sights. At issue are likely illegal gifts cops seem to have received from two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top contributors in Brooklyn\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community. The investigation may also implicate one or more of the much-criticized nonprofits the mayor created to raise cash and advance his liberal agenda, which the group Citizens Union labeled a \u201cshadow government\u201d earlier this year.\u000a\u000aGiven his success exposing shady dealings in Albany, City Hall and on Wall Street, Mr. Bharara (a former aide to Mr. Schumer) could well become the attorney general for the United States under a Clinton administration\u2014or, given that Ms. Clinton set up her controversial \u201chomebrew\u201d email server on his turf, he could wind up leading the investigation that denies her the White House.\u000a\u000a4. Andrew Cuomo, Governor\u000a\u000aJust in time for the presidential season, the famously cautious and calculating governor banked left\u2014hard. He forewent his own rumored bid for the White House to instead become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s earliest endorsers and biggest boosters in New York. He also embraced two of the causes he once scoffed at: a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. Both passed in this year\u2019s budget, giving New York some of the most liberal labor laws in the country.\u000a\u000aThe governor has also abandoned his once-proud fiscal conservatism, announcing billions upon billions of dollars worth in infrastructure investments. Every decrepit and despised New York transit hub would get demolished then built anew under the governor\u2019s designs: LaGuardia Airport, Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Nobody seems to know yet where all the money will come from, but sources tell the Observer Mr. Cuomo sees these projects as his legacy in office.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Cuomo is auditioning for some role in Ms. Clinton\u2019s Cabinet (or what that role would be\u2014they\u2019re based in the same state, so vice president is pretty much off the table) or whether he just decided to spite his rival, Mr. de Blasio, by snatching away the mantle of progressivism. Either way, New York City will be a very different place by the time he departs Albany.\u000a\u000a5. Bill de Blasio, Mayor\u000a\u000aFor all his bumbling, fumbling, stumbling, bobbling, unforced errors and outright pratfalls, Mr. de Blasio managed this spring to push through what may be his most significant accomplishment in office: rezoning New York City. From now on, developers will get the benefit of loosened height and density restrictions, but they\u2019ll have to set aside 25 to 30 percent of new apartments for middle-class and lower-middle class tenants.\u000a\u000aThe mayor is still missing a new version of the 421a building tax credit\u2014the gas for his affordable housing engine\u2014but the rule changes have potential to permanently change both the city\u2019s rental market and its physical terrain. That will doubtless outlast Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure at Gracie Mansion, however long that ends up being.\u000a\u000aAfter a few flirtations with his ideological cousin Mr. Sanders, Mr. de Blasio belatedly backed Ms. Clinton, his former employer, for president. His hesitance seemed to earn him her ire, but the mayor paid his penance knocking on doors for her in Iowa, and she appears to have warmed to him again. His grandiose hopes to hold a candidate forum and shape the 2016 race have fallen through, and he seems to have accepted a humbler role in the process, shilling for her in New York, the same as nearly every other Democrat in the city.\u000a\u000aHe just better hope that Mr. Bharara\u2019s investigation goes away.\u000a\u000a6. Bill Bratton, Police Commissioner\u000a\u000aThe media-savvy police commissioner about town was at the top of this last year and with good reason: Mr. Bratton is many ways a better politician than the mayor who hired him. He is still the commissioner who seems to get the most leeway from the mayor he serves. But while Mr. Bratton dominated city headlines last year\u2014going against the mayor to call for more cops in the\u000a\u000abudget, dealing with the fallout of massive antipolice protests\u2014things are simply a bit quieter this year, as City Hall moved to focus on housing more than the issues aligned with the NYPD. And Mr. Bharara\u2019s probe into higher-ups at the NYPD accepting gifts is sure to be a headache\u2014though the mayor is doubtless glad he chose Mr. Bratton to lead the department over one of the men being investigated, former Chief of Department Philip Banks. Mr. Bratton continues to say what\u2019s on his mind, even jumping into the presidential race to take Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to task\u2014and tell him to \u201cshut up\u201d\u2014in response to his proposal to monitor Muslims to prevent terror attacks. Any police commissioner is a major presence in New York but particularly this one, with his penchant for hitting the best restaurants and the biggest social events, filling a role that the homebody mayor doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy much.\u000a\u000a7. Carl Heastie, Assembly Speaker\u000a\u000aHis first year as Assembly speaker, Mr. Heastie gained a reputation for the same detached taciturnity as his predecessor Mr. Silver. This spring, he showed for the first time that he might have some of the fallen pol\u2019s famed negotiating prowess. The Bronx lawmaker shielded the city from up to a billion dollars in cuts to the CUNY system and in Medicaid assistance from Albany that Mr. Cuomo had proposed in his budget. He also laid out a plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, to the governor\u2019s chagrin, indicating that Mr. Heastie is looking to put pressure on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s left flank.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nearly impossible to decipher the speaker\u2019s motivations, but he\u2019s the closest thing Mr. de Blasio has to a powerful friend in Albany\u2014even though he\u2019s much closer to the mayor\u2019s main rival at home, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.\u000a\u000a8. Melissa Mark-Viverito, Council Speaker\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the City Council as mainly a rubber stamp for the mayor\u2014but even if it is, its speaker is looking to make the most of her position. Ms. Mark-Viverito has tried to assert her\u000a\u000aindependence from Mr. de Blasio: making amendments to his housing plan, throwing cold water all over his crumbling effort to ban horse carriages (but only after first carrying the water for it), breaking from him on the efforts to cap Uber in the city. But she\u2019s also used her perch to be a voice on national issues, speaking out frequently on immigration and representation of Latinos in local government and becoming a favored surrogate for Hillary Clinton. In fact, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s political prowess was perhaps best on display with her endorsement of Ms. Clinton\u2014particularly considering how Mr. de Blasio bungled his. Plenty of people are whispering about whether the speaker might be offered a spot in a future Clinton administration when her term in the Council expires.\u000a\u000a9. Anthony Shorris, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aThe unsung bureaucrat who makes City Hall go around, Mr. Shorris is the man who does the day-to-day managing of the city as its first deputy mayor. He took a leading role in reassessing the city\u2019s services for the homeless after one of his fellow deputy mayors hastily left the department and the leader of the Department of Homeless Services was seemingly pushed out. His institutional knowledge of government has been key for Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a10. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO\u000a\u000aThe Goldman Sachs CEO has come a long way from the Brooklyn housing projects he grew up in\u2014financially at least. A search of Ms. Clinton\u2019s donor rolls comes up flush with his employees, providing fodder for both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. (That goes without mentioning all those speeches Goldman paid the former first lady to deliver.) He also counts Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife among his underlings, and he enjoys a fairly warm relationship with Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a11. Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator\u000a\u000aFor now, Gillibrand will be in Schumer\u2019s shadow, but New York\u2019s junior senator has been building her profile as an advocate for women and the sexually abused. Long-removed from her days as a conservative upstate lawmaker viewed skeptically by the city\u2019s Democratic establishment, she just may be future presidential candidate material.\u000a\u000a12. Steven Banks, Commissioner of Social Services\u000a\u000aMr. Banks has emerged in the last year as a major player in the mayor\u2019s administration, rising up a somewhat obscure post at the Human Resources Administration to become the face of the city\u2019s response to a growing and difficult to manage homelessness problem\u2014and its brand-new Commissioner of Social Services. Mr. Banks, who made his bones at the Legal Aid Society suing the departments he now leads, will now oversee both the HRA and the Department of Homeless Services. Even-handed and hyper-knowledgeable about his field, Mr. Banks clearly has the trust of Mr. de Blasio, who has let Mr. Banks lead several of his own City Hall press conferences.\u000a\u000a13. James Capalino, CEO of Capalino + Company\u000a\u000aThis veteran lobbyist\u2019s fortunes have steadily risen since City Hall was taken over by Mr. de Blasio\u2014making his lobbying firm the highest-earning in the city. That\u2019s raised some eyebrows, considering Mr. Capalino\u2019s close relationship with Mr. de Blasio, for whom he\u2019s raised campaign cash. That tight relationship has been attractive to clients of Mr. Capalino\u2019s, particularly the real estate powerhouses like Brookfield Properties and SL Green that employ him. But what\u2019s really put Mr. Capalino in the spotlight, and under the microscope, is his connection to a deal that has proven disastrous for the mayor: the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side property that will allow a private developer to turn what was once an nursing home for AIDS patients into luxury condos\u2014and which helped the building\u2019s owner make a $72 million profit selling it.\u000a\u000a14. Hakeem Jeffries, Congressman\u000a\u000aPossibly Brooklyn\u2019s brightest rising star, the congressman has become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s top lieutenants in the black community. A relatively new member of the New York delegation and a Democrat in the Republican House, Mr. Jeffries has long reportedly eyed other pols\u2019 jobs\u2014including Mr. de Blasio\u2019s and Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s. Perhaps a job in the White House would be a suitable outlet for his ambitions.\u000a\u000a15. Vicki Been and Carl Weisbrod, Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner and Planning Chairman\u000a\u000aThe dynamic duo at the forefront of the mayor\u2019s plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in a decade, Ms. Been and Mr. Weisbrod played major roles in cajoling the planning commission and city council to pass the mayor\u2019s massive rezoning plan. But even after that victory, there\u2019s still plenty to be done in terms of neighborhood-specific efforts, like the combative one underway in East New York.\u000a\u000a16. Thomas Prendergast, MTA Chairman\u000a\u000aMr. Prendergast not only runs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2014and therefore oversees a vital part of nearly every New Yorker\u2019s day\u2014he also serves as a major New York City surrogate for Gov. Cuomo. Often, that means going toe-to-toe with the mayor, arguing over things like the city\u2019s share of the bill for the MTA.\u000a\u000a17. Michael Bloomberg, Former Mayor\u000a\u000aMr. Bloomberg couldn\u2019t stay away from politics forever. When it looked like the nation might face a Sanders/Trump race for the presidency, the billionaire media mogul publicly weighed injecting another New Yorker into the mix\u2014himself. He ultimately realized an independent doesn\u2019t have a prayer in America\u2019s two-party system, but he bitterly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive and demagogic\u201d style upon withdrawing from contention. Look for him to endorse Ms. Clinton after the convention, possibly with his wallet.\u000a\u000a18. Emma Wolfe, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs\u000a\u000aA veteran member of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inner circle, Ms. Wolfe is the mayor\u2019s political fixer and his liaison to the groups outside City Hall with which he must work\u2014the governor\u2019s office, unions, the City Council and just about everyone in Albany. Behind her aw-shucks demeanor is a tough and experienced political operative and one of the mayor\u2019s closest and sharpest advisers.\u000a\u000a19. Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation\u000a\u000aDismiss Mr. Murdoch\u2019s New York Post at your peril. The venerable tabloid is forever a pain for any mayor but especially this one\u2014who just last week saw himself on the wood (that\u2019s the cover, for those who don\u2019t know tab-speak) three days in a row, accused of scandal. For readers who like their criticism of Mr. de Blasio a little classier, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s got The Wall Street Journal\u2014which also offers influential reporting on just about everything else. And then, there\u2019s that little cable powerhouse Fox News. In a town where the media is a major force, Mr. Murdoch is the force behind plenty of it.\u000a\u000a20. Dean Fuleihan, Budget Director\u000a\u000aThe city\u2019s moneyman, Mr. Fuleihan oversees New York\u2019s mammoth budget\u2014proposed to be $82.1 billion this year. It\u2019s a less stressful job than in years past, now that the city has inked contracts with most of the municipal workforce and with a budget the mayor himself has admitted isn\u2019t exactly as exciting as his previous ones. But when it comes to budgets, as City Hall has also noted, boring can be good. Perhaps the biggest challenge is working with Albany\u2014something Mr. Fuleihan, a former aide to disgraced ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, knows plenty about.\u000a\u000a21. Alicia Glen, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most headline-grabbing challenge of Ms. Glen\u2019s deputy mayorship, shepherding through the mayor\u2019s affordable housing plan, is done now that the plan has been approved. But there will be plenty of work to do make that plan a reality\u2014particularly in the absence of the 421a tax credit that induces so many developers to build. And Ms. Glen will remain a bridge to the real estate types and private companies that play a major role in economic development in the city.\u000a\u000a22. James Malatras, Director of State Operations\u000a\u000aMr. Malatras is Gov. Cuomo\u2019s go-to-guy on policy, and lately it seems like lots of the policies that Mr. Cuomo rolls out focus on New York City. Mr. Malatras is tasked with putting out fires like the one Mr. Cuomo set when he proposed shifting nearly half a billion dollars of costs for CUNY to the city.\u000a\u000a23. George Gresham, 1199SEIU President\u000a\u000aGresham, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, is the unique figure who manages to be on good terms with both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo. As the head of the largest union in the state, he\u2019s been at the forefront of the fight for $15 push and remains maybe the most important New York labor leader out there.\u000a\u000a24. Dean Baquet, Executive Editor of The New York Times\u000a\u000aIf the screaming headlines of the Post or the woodcuts of the Journal aren\u2019t your speed, how about Mr. Baquet\u2019s Grey Lady? As the editor of the Times, Mr. Baquet determines all the news fit to print on politics ranging from City Hall to Albany to the campaign trail. Plenty of reporters have been plucked from local politics beats to chase the presidential candidates\u2014but at the same time, the paper is beefing up its presence in City Hall.\u000a\u000a25. Phil Walzak, Senior Advisor to the Mayor\u000a\u000aAfter a rocky stint as press secretary\u2014a gig that wasn\u2019t quite what he wanted in the first place\u2014Mr. Walzak has settled in as \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the mayor. He still spends a decent amount of his time crafting Mr. de Blasio\u2019s message, at least when he and the mayor aren\u2019t heading off on road trips to watch ballgames.\u000a\u000a26. Jonathan Rosen, Co-Founder ofBerlinRosen\u000a\u000aMr. Rosen, of the PR firm BerlinRosen, is perhaps Mr. de Blasio\u2019s best-known outside consultant\u2014but the mayor\u2019s relationship with Mr. Rosen and others has been gaining greater scrutiny. Mr. Rosen is not a lobbyist and as such does not have to disclose his meetings with the mayor, but his firm represents a slew of boldfaced names that have major business at City Hall. BerlinRosen also handles the mayor\u2019s nongovernmental press, putting out his message as Mr. de Blasio continually tries to influence national politics and spinning on issues like his campaign contributions.\u000a\u000a27. Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of Teachers\u000a\u000aWhile the UFT originally backed former comptroller Bill Thompson, Mr. Mulgrew came around pretty quickly to Mr. de Blasio: The union was the first to ink a new contract with City Hall, and from there Mr. Mulgrew hasn\u2019t looked back. He\u2019s been a frequent visitor to City Hall and a loud defender of the mayor. That must be a welcome change for Mr. Mulgrew after 12 years of being frozen out by Mr. Bloomberg.\u000a\u000a28. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u000a\u000aMr. Dimon is the head of one of those big banks Bernie Sanders is always talking about breaking up, so unsurprisingly he doesn\u2019t think doing so is a great idea. He remains a powerful representative of Wall Street\u2014which is something of an industry non grata in this election cycle but has long held sway over New York\u2019s elected officials, especially Mr. Schumer, to whom Mr. Dimon has donated plenty.\u000a\u000a29. Scott Stringer, Comptroller\u000a\u000aMr. Stringer was among the first city Democratic pols to start going after Mr. de Blasio, and as others have joined in, he\u2019s remained a loud voice thanks to his ability to turn out audits and run investigations. Is it all part of a lead-up to challenging Mr. de Blasio in 2017? It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Stringer is willing to take that risk, but he\u2019s clearly intending to set himself up as a critical voice and perhaps an alternative.\u000a\u000a30. Bill Lipton and Dan Cantor, Co-Founders of the Working Families Party\u000a\u000aAfter backing Mr. Cuomo in 2014 and pissing off its base, the progressive party is getting a redo by going all-in on Bernie Sanders, even as the New York Democratic establishment (and many WFP allies) unite around Ms. Clinton. Were Mr. Sanders to exceed expectations on April 19, expect plenty of accolades for the two men, who have made the labor-backed party a force in New York.\u000a\u000a31. Letitia James, Public Advocate\u000a\u000aThe public advocate has sought to bring her legal experience to the role, filing a slew of lawsuits against various city agencies. Several of them have been tossed out, but that hasn\u2019t slowed down Ms. James\u2019 brand of agitating against the city while also being careful not to do much damage to her friend, Mr. de Blasio. Ms. James has also made a habit of traveling all across the city for events like town halls\u2014a move that might help boost her numbers when she runs for re-election (or perhaps for a higher office).\u000a\u000a32. Shola Olatoye, NYCHA Chairwoman\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of tough jobs in city government, but leading the city\u2019s aging public housing system has got to be one of the very toughest. Ms. Olatoye is tasked with trying to find a way to make the New York City Housing Authority solvent again, and she\u2019ll seek to do so through the Next Generation NYCHA proposal, a controversial plan to lease green space on NYCHA property to private developers.\u000a\u000a33. Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ SEIU\u000a\u000aMr. Figueroa was another player in the major effort to increase the minimum wage in the state, first for fast food workers and then for everyone. He\u2019s also an outspoken advocate of immigration reform and gatekeeper of a union of largely Latino membership that helps sway local elections and endorsed Ms. Clinton for president.\u000a\u000a34. Julissa Ferreras, City Councilwoman\u000a\u000aThe chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s finance committee keeps a relatively low profile, but the Queens lawmaker is quietly one of the most influential council members and a candidate to replace Melissa Mark-Viverito as speaker. Were she to take the reins in 2018, she\u2019d be an automatic mayoral contender.

aVNEWARK \u2013 World leaders gathered on Tuesday in Johannesburg, South Africa to honor Nelson Mandela, a man who dedicated his life to fighting, and defeating, apartheid, a system of racial segregation embedded in his country\u2019s laws and enforced by its police. When remembering Mandela, New Jersey\u2019s leaders have mentioned a disturbing truth \u2013 the Garden State, in many ways, suffers de facto segregation that leaves its citizens separate but unequal.\u000a\u000aIt was Gov. Jim Florio who first coined the term \u201cthe two New Jerseys\u201d in his 1990 inaugural address, the same year Mandela was freed from prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor New Jersey to be truly a commonwealth, we simply cannot have two New Jerseys,\u201d Florio said. \u201cOne where youngsters go off on a road to college, and another where youngsters go off on a road to despair. One where towns flourish with the rewards of prosperity, and another with decaying cities, littered with abandoned cars and abandoned hopes.\u201d\u000a\u000aNearly 25 years later, the hope of closing this gap is a dream deferred.\u000a\u000aOne example of the continuing divide between rich and poor New Jersey was underscored by recent studies released jointly by Rutgers-Newark and UCLA in October. Stark numbers presented in the reports indicate that in the 2010-11 school year, almost half of black and Hispanic students attended schools where fewer than 10 percent of the students were white, and many attended schools where there were essentially no white students. The Rutgers report from the university\u2019s Institute on Education Law and Policy went so far as to call 191 of 1,597 schools statewide \u201capartheid schools,\u201d defined as schools where 1 percent or less of the student population is white and where at least 79 percent of students are low-income, a \u201cdouble segregation\u201d marked by race and poverty.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Dr. M. William Howard, Jr., pastor of Newark\u2019s Bethany Baptist Church and the former chairman of Rutgers\u2019 Board of Governors, met Mandela personally as a result of his decades-long anti-apartheid activism.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew Jersey is arguably one of the most racially segregated states in the nation,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe question for me is not only race, but economics. Black people came to places like Newark, Paterson and Camden from the South to find work. That work has now disappeared, but those residents remained. The absence of capital, combined with a smidgen of racism, has produced the separation of families, decline in housing, increase in crime, and decline in the public schools in the cities. You will find black people living in some of the wealthiest suburbs in the state, provided they can afford the housing, and therefore have access to the suburban public schools.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we face today in our urban centers in our state is what Mandela still faced at the time of his death in South Africa,\u201d Howard added. \u201cIf we were to go together now to South Africa, we would find millions of black people living in the same squalid conditions that they knew before Mandela was released from prison. And we would find certain highly educated, economically advantaged black people now living in opulent, suburban areas. I\u2019m sure than Mandela recognized this, was not happy with this, and saw it as the long-term work of the South African government and society to correct this imbalance. New Jersey\u2019s cities are largely populated by people who are unlikely to be able to access the modern economy. You cannot explain the horrific situation of segregation in the state of New Jersey only in terms of race. To continue to chip away at public schools by the introduction of charter schools to the point that they are almost tipping the balance in places like Newark is a big mistake. Education is not only the key to reviving our central cities \u2013 it\u2019s the key to keeping our competitive edge in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoland Anglin, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers, noted that the man seen as the father of South Africa would take a similar guiding hand to the Garden State\u2019s problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would first say that we need to look at the things that created segregation in New Jersey, just the way he looked at the things that created segregation in South Africa,\u201d Anglin said. \u201cI think he would say that the thing South Africa did with their struggle, that we perhaps need to do, is to have a clear and decisive forum for reconciliation and move forward on the things that are still problematic. In Newark, for example, we\u2019ve never come to a real reconciliation about the disturbances of the 1960s, and how society needed to do more to make sure that those who have been left behind have an adequate opportunity to progress so that balanced communities can be formed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have the suburbanization of people of color in New Jersey, but they are being re-concentrated in pockets,\u201d Anglin added. \u201cResidential patterns are not happening in a way that promotes upward mobility. Change involves some level of enforcing fair-housing laws that challenges landlords who won\u2019t rent to certain racial minorities coming out of urban areas. It also involves some level of incentives and social engineering. We don\u2019t have that appetite as a society, much less as a state. Nelson Mandela would say that we need to cement the public will on all sides to make change, not just people in urban areas \u2013 that\u2019s a doomed strategy. It is no one\u2019s interest to have a poor, under-fed class of people who don\u2019t have access to opportunity. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that they participate in the public life and economic life of this state and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor her part, Assemblywoman Grace Spencer (D-29) recalled protesting against apartheid during her college years. Many commentators have observed that there were two distinct periods in Nelson Mandela\u2019s career: a confrontational period where he advocated armed struggle against apartheid, the other a more conciliatory period after his release from prison that smoothed the way to majority rule in South Africa. Regarding what kind of public leadership is needed to end de facto segregation in New Jersey, Spencer suggested the adoption of a hybrid tone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe person who is rambunctious and defiant begins to call attention to de facto segregation in New Jersey,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut you also need the person who is more conciliatory who can bring people together and mend the wounds of the problem. I don\u2019t think apartheid would have ended if it wasn\u2019t for the rambunctious Mandela, and I don\u2019t think there would have been such a good transition without the conciliatory Mandela. You need both.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the man who encapsulated the concept of two New Jerseys, what must be done to end de facto desegregation in the state is clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would feel a need to speak out and point out the deficiencies that exist. We still do have two New Jerseys. Things have changed a bit, but only for the worse,\u201d Gov. Florio told PolitickerNJ.com. \u201cThe middle class is now feeling threatened by economic problems as well. It\u2019s going to take policy changes to make us a much more egalitarian society. Mr. Mandela would be out in the forefront trying to get those changes made.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need leadership that is willing to tell people things that they don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Florio added. \u201cAt this point, there are no good options. It\u2019s the difference between losing a finger and being decapitated. During the gubernatorial campaign we just went through, neither of the candidates, nor the press, talked about the overwhelming fiscal problems we\u2019re going to have in New Jersey in the coming years. That\u2019s because if you talk about it, someone is going to ask you what you\u2019re going to do about it. We all know poverty exists. But somebody\u2019s got to start talking about it. Somebody\u2019s got to be out front. Nelson Mandela is a good example of someone who was willing to take on things that were much more burdensome than things that we experienced. If he was willing to do that, then we have to have people who will at least raise issues for debate.\u201d

aVIn Julian Schnabel: A Private Portrait, Schnabel is either talking or people close to him are talking about him. On a larger screen than his own large canvases, the artist paints, revisits his journey from Texas to New York, recalls the 1980s, dives off a high platform into the Mediterranean and paints some more.\u000a\u000aThe film is a cinematic portrait that features archival footage and is directed by Pappi Corsicato, a filmmaker whose work spans profiles of Richard Serra and investigations into the ruined city of Pompeii. Schnabel, who is credited as an executive producer, says there\u2019s no special reason why the film premiered last week at the Tribeca Film Festival and will open Friday at the Quad in Manhattan.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe the reason why it\u2019s coming out now is because it\u2019s finished now,\u201d said Schnabel, 65, sitting at a table with Corsicato in the skyscraper office of Cohen Media, a film distribution company founded by the real estate tycoon Charles Cohen, owner and renovator of the Quad.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to make a movie about me. What was important was that the work was shown. It\u2019s not trying to show something that\u2019s spectacular, but at least you can get a sense of the scale of the work,\u201d said Schnabel, who wore a warm-up jacket with a reproduction of one of his paintings on the back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI sort of feel like I\u2019m a broken vase, and that he picked up the pieces and put the vase together as best he could,\u201d he said, speaking about Corsicato. That\u2019s high praise from a man who has broken his share of plates.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a biography,\u201d said Schnabel, who told me he never intended to make a self-portrait on film. \u201cBut my father said to me, when I made a film about Jean-Michel Basquiat, that I should have made it about myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked Schnabel what he said to his father after that suggestion.\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018It\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u2019 \u201d he remembered saying.\u000a\u000aSchnabel also noted that he originally hadn\u2019t intended to make the film about Basquiat either. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a movie director,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when Jean-Michel died, a Polish movie director came to interview me about Jean-Michel. His name was Lech Majewski, and he had a pretty encyclopedic knowledge of film. But he was a tourist, and I knew Jean-Michel so well and I knew what the world was. I think one of the problems with movie-making is that people don\u2019t know their topic.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorsicato, a Neapolitan who knew Schnabel before he spent two years making the documentary, set his sights high when it came to making a documentary about the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s my vision of Julian\u2019s life. It\u2019s my personal point of view. It\u2019s like a story that you see in a movie. It\u2019s like a classic movie. In the beginning I was inspired by Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane, the little kid who becomes grand\u2014but from an artistic point of view. It\u2019s really like an American dream,\u201d he said in heavily accented English.\u000a\u000aI asked whether Corsicato saw Schnabel as Orson Welles or Charles Foster Kane.\u000a\u000aSchnabel spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe it\u2019s even more of a Fitzcarraldo kind of character, in the sense of what makes you do something that is ultimately illogical, like going to Sevilla and filling an abandoned monastery with paintings,\u201d Schnabel said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I do know is that history is a lie,\u201d Schnabel declared. \u201cEverybody has their version of history.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were there and they were there, and it\u2019s amazing how different their perception is of an event that occurred, but that\u2019s their truth,\u201d Schnabel said, looking at Corsicato. \u201cSomebody else would make a very different film. When he says that this is a private portrait, I would say that it\u2019s private to him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThroughout the film, family and friends recall Schnabel breaking rules and being true to his own creative spirit. Not a critical word is spoken, yet some recollections may come as a surprise. Jeff Koons, a contemporary, discusses how Schnabel helped him sell his first work of art.\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess it was nice that he said that. That\u2019s true, and I also got him his first exhibition,\u201d said Schnabel. \u201cWhen I first came to New York, nobody really helped me. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought it was good to help other people. It was pretty tough. Nobody really liked young artists in the \u201970s. I supported other artists, and I still do.\u201d\u000a\u000aTough times indeed. Shadowman, another documentary that revisits the 1980s art scene, made its world premiere at Tribeca and was runner-up for the festival\u2019s audience award. The subject is Richard Hambleton, whose graffiti daubs of threatening figures on the corners of buildings got him more attention than Keith Haring or Basquiat in the early 1980s. Hambleton, who attended his premiere in a wheelchair with a mask covering his cancer-ravaged face, struggled with drug addiction, then and now, and would disappear from public view for years at a time. In the film, Hambleton laments that, \u201cat least Basquiat died. I was alive when I died, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Hambleton story brought Schnabel back to the theme of success in the art market. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about apples and oranges. It depends on what you make,\u201d Schnabel noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many different lives,\u201d said Schnabel, who has made two films in his career about artists who died young: Basquiat and the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (Before Night Falls). \u201cLook, Vito Acconci died last night. Was Vito Acconci a successful artist? I would say he was. Was he a household name? Plenty of people who you talk to won\u2019t know who he was. But I can tell you how important he was,\u201d said Schnabel.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can look at an [Anselm] Kiefer painting which is very large, and people can understand why you might buy one of those and hang it in your house. But what about a Fat Chair by Joseph Beuys, which generated what Kiefer does?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same kind of marketability, because it\u2019s a peculiar object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeuys was a seminal influence for many artists\u2014Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Binky Palermo\u2014who were all his students. Yet when he died, his obituary might have said, \u2018the greatest artist on the north side of the street in Dusseldorf,\u2019 \u201d Schnabel added.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo many people around us have died\u2014Lou [Reed], David Bowie, and now Jonathan Demme. It\u2019s a death sentence being born. But what do you make out of it?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cSo if someone says that Keith [Haring], died and Jean-Michel died\u2014and it\u2019s certainly why his paintings got so expensive\u2014I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the answer to say, \u2018I\u2019d rather die before I get old,\u2019 like in the punk rock song.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked if he would be making another film of his own. The artist responded with the name of yet another artist who died young. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something about Vincent van Gogh. I\u2019m working with Jean-Claude Carriere,\u201d he said. Carriere, the veteran screenwriter, is one of many friends interviewed in Corsicato\u2019s documentary.\u000a\u000aVan Gogh\u2019s myth is securely in place, but I mentioned to Schnabel that Before Night Falls, his portrait of a martyr to Castro and to AIDS, is responsible for making Reinaldo Arenas and his poetry known to a far greater public than if the film had never been made.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping to do,\u201d he said, looking across the table at Corsicato, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s what this film will do for me.\u201d

aVPolitico reported on August 7 that former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid called Sen. Bernie Sanders in a panic when he discovered the Nevada chapter of Our Revolution endorsed single-payer health care advocate Jesse Sbaih over establishment-backed candidate Rep. Jacky Rosen to run for Senate in 2018 against Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller. Sanders agreed to prevent Our Revolution\u2019s national organization from endorsing Sbaih over Rosen, but Reid\u2019s panic reveals that establishment Democrats are increasingly worried about progressives pushing for single-payer health care.\u000a\u000aOne-hundred-and-sixteen Democrats in the House have signed onto Congressman John Conyers Medicare for all bill, the highest number since Conyers began introducing the bill in 2003. He has introduced it every congressional session ever since.\u000a\u000a\u201cA single-payer system is inevitable. That\u2019s the first thing. This is inevitable. But just because something is inevitable doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen without an effort and that it will happen in time to help the mass of American people who are looking for better options than they have now,\u201d former Congressman Dennis Kucinich said in an interview with the Observer. Kucinich served eight terms in Congress from 1997 to 2013 and often introduced a single-payer Medicare for all health care bill with Conyers while in office. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sitting around worrying about what might happen. We have to make things happen. And if I\u2019ve learned anything about Congress, it\u2019s that there is a paradox of people who are in some of the most powerful positions in our society but feel powerless to deal with these big questions. And yet each member of Congress does have real impact on the long-term health of the country. One of the complicating factors is the amount of money that comes from various interests who are promoting the current system, and they try to use that to hold members hostage. But when one considers the broader claims of our constituents, this current system cannot meet the diverse health needs of America.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest obstacles single-payer health care faces is the amount of donations the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries pour into both parties. Both industries are against single-payer because it would negatively affect the industries\u2019 profits. In the 2016 election cycle, 30 House Democrats and nine Senate Democrats received campaign donations from Blue Cross/Blue Shield\u2019s Super PAC, one of the largest health insurers in the country. Out of those House members, only nine House Democrats have signed on to co-sponsor the Medicare for all bill. Sens. Charles Schumer, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who have all received donations from the PAC, have offered half-hearted support for the bill. The pressure from progressives to support single-payer continues to mount for establishment Democrats.\u000a\u000aHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 2018 Democratic primary challenger, Stephen Jaffe, is running on a single-payer health care platform.\u000a\u000aDavid Hildebrand is challenging Sen. Diane Feinstein in the primaries in support of single-payer.\u000a\u000aTim Canova is challenging former DNC Chair Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida. Single-payer health care is a divisive issue between the two candidates, as Wasserman Schultz has yet to support the policy.\u000a\u000aActivist Paula Jean Swearengin is primarying Sen. Joe Manchin in 2018 with the help of Brand New Congress, an organization founded by former Bernie Sanders staffers. The primary puts pressure on Manchin, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, to support the policy.\u000a\u000aIn Nevada, Congressman Ruben Kihuen, a freshman representative who won his seat with the help of former Sen. Harry Reid, is facing a grieving mother, Amy Vilela, in the Democratic primary. Vilela lost her 22-year-old daughter after an emergency room refused to conduct the necessary screenings to diagnose deep vein thrombosis, which she suffered from. Kihuen refused to co-sponsor the bill after Vilela explained her experience to him at a town hall in May 2017. In her campaign announcement, Vilela said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait around for career politicians, their donors or special interests to do the right thing. We need bold action now. We need representatives in Washington that understand the stakes of this fight and who will never stop advocating for the people.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur Revolution President Nina Turner echoed her sentiment in an interview with Politico: \u201cAny Democrat worth their salt that doesn\u2019t unequivocally say Medicare for all is the way to go? To me, there\u2019s something wrong with them. We\u2019re not going to accept no more hemming and hawing. No more game playing. Make your stand.\u201d

aVCould Ruth Negga pull an upset on Sunday night at the Academy Awards? The Ethiopian-Irish actress doesn\u2019t have her knickers in a twist over it \u2013 the stunningLoving lead, 35, is on a collision course with stardom and, win or lose, doors are swinging open in Hollywood. The petite actress removed her Prada heels and dug in with the Observer to discuss her extraordinarily ordinary heroine. Mildred Loving, a modest Black woman who married a white man in 1958 and courageously battled the Virginia anti-miscegenation laws for love, equity and the fundamental right for a man and a woman to have a family in the United States.\u000a\u000aWould you call yourself brave?\u000a\u000aRuth Negga: Definitely not. I\u2019m the scaredy-est cat I know. I would hope I\u2019d be brave and that in certain situations, when it would call for it, that I would stand up. But am I tough? I can be quite tough \u2013 but it\u2019s not angry small women\u2019s syndrome.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not?\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not. When you\u2019re small and people address you in that patronizing way, and you think please don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t think being brave and being tough are necessarily mutually exclusive, but you can be either or in certain situations. No one is any one trait 24/7. In order to be brave you need to understand what it is to be fearful. Isn\u2019t that what they say?\u000a\u000aDo you consider Mildred Loving brave?\u000a\u000aAbsolutely! I think she\u2019s brave, but I don\u2019t know if Mildred thought that she was brave. And I can only access that. I had to leave my thoughts out, because I was playing her. For Mildred, she was just pursuing her right to justice. I don\u2019t think she thought it would take nine years. Can you imagine? Every step of the way, she was just doing, and I think sometimes just getting on with things and doing are extraordinary acts of bravery.\u000a\u000aCan you elaborate?\u000a\u000aAnyone who\u2019s had to confront a situation where they feel like they had to fight a little harder, or overcome obstacles, it becomes second nature. Nothing\u2019s going to be handed to you, so in a weird way, you develop this amazing not even a work ethic, but you\u2019re like a Duracell battery. You\u2019ll outlast everyone. You have the ability \u2013you just need the opportunity. The opportunities have to be there. That\u2019s all that people need.\u000a\u000aWhen did opportunity first knock in your own career?\u000a\u000aI was very lucky to get a job right out of college in Dublin [Trinity College\u2019s The Samuel Beckett Centre]. Just before I graduated, Annie Ryan cast me as the title character in a stage version of Nabokov\u2019s Lolita. It\u2019s one of my favorite books. It\u2019s amazing and horrifying \u2014 and this was amazing and horrifying.\u000a\u000aDo you see the lover and the monster in the lecherous character Humbert Humbert, who would now likely be on the sex offender registry?\u000a\u000aIt scares us because we see that those things can live side by side within certain people. It\u2019s scary because we don\u2019t want to know that we can be capable of grotesque acts. I think we\u2019re desperate, aren\u2019t we, to iron out nuances and complexities in life because we think it makes life more palatable. But, in fact, it\u2019s just making it more difficult because it\u2019s luring us down the primrose path, which is wrong. It means that we understand each other less and less and ourselves less and less, because if we forgo the nuance, then we\u2019re just not going to make any progress.\u000a\u000aYou definitely explore the dark side in your violent, volatile comic-book anti-heroine Tulip O\u2019Hare in the AMC TV series Preacher.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s something grotesque about Tulip. I wanted her face to even be grotesque sometimes. But still be peculiarly magnetic and sexy and, like, everything that women are rarely allowed to be on our screens \u2014 because we are in real life. Like me and my girls, like we were all of those things. I I thought I\u2019d like to contribute to that broadening of female roles. Tulip\u2019s fun and she\u2019s feisty. And then she\u2019s not so fun and she\u2019s not so feisty. I embrace the complexity and nuances \u2014 and that she\u2019s funny. I find her funny.\u000a\u000aOne of your signature qualities is large expressive eyes out of proportion to your frame.\u000a\u000aI have a real sticky face. I have no poker face. It\u2019s actually handy being an actress, though. I\u2019ll take the lack of poker face.\u000a\u000aWhat did you take away from living in Mildred\u2019s shoes?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think I can sum it up in a sentence, really. I think that anyone who worked on this film surrounded by those two people, Mildred and Richard Loving, can\u2019t help but find their goodness infectious, and aspirational. I think I\u2019ve internalized it for my heart. Mildred\u2019s still there. Some characters stay with you for a while; others, I find their scent gets less strong. Some people are forever etched into you.\u000a\u000aLike Mildred Loving?\u000a\u000aVery much so.

aVThe NJ Sharing Network Foundation is welcoming Yvonne Payne of Teaneck to its Board of Trustees \u2013 two years after she received a life-saving heart transplant.\u000a\u000aPayne eagerly looks for opportunities to honor the memory of child actress Sammi Kane Kraft, whose tragic death in a 2012 California car crash meant a new heart and a new chance at life for Payne.\u000a\u000aPayne lead a team at NJ Sharing Network\u2019s 5K Walk and USATF-Certified Race on June 8, raising thousands of dollars for the life-saving mission.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am touched by the entire NJ Sharing Network organization,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI definitely want to help out and ensure as many people as possible know the importance of registering for organ donation, especially in the Black and Latino communities. I want to share my story with others and hope they can support this beautiful organization.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayne \u2013 wife of Fox Business Network contributor Charles Payne \u2013 is inspired by her heart donor, Sammi Kane Kraft. Kraft, whose real-life baseball skills landed her the starring role as a spunky pitching ace in the 2005 remake of \u201cBad News Bears,\u201d died Oct. 9, 2012, at the age of 20.\u000a\u000aFour days later, Payne underwent heart transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Today, the lively 56-year-old Teaneck woman is determined to give back something tangible to other people in need \u2013 including her service to the Foundation.\u000a\u000aPayne recalls an \u201cactive and athletic childhood,\u201d but rheumatic fever at age 13 left her with a weak heart and prone to fatigue due to arrhythmia. \u201cI learned to cope and tried to be as active as possible as a teenager and young adult,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy heart always seemed so noisy in my chest,\u201d she recalled. In her mid-30s Payne was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening rapid heartbeat that ultimately required her to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctors told me I would eventually need a heart transplant. That was a frightening idea, so I kept telling myself and everyone else that I\u2019d be just fine,\u201d Payne said. By 2011, her condition worsened and her bouts of exhaustion became more frequent.\u000a\u000aPhysicians at New York Presbyterian implanted a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in July 2012 to provide temporary relief. \u201cAn LVAD is a bridge-to-a-transplant until a heart is available,\u201d said Payne, noting that her recovery and potentially long wait for a donor brought on \u201cfear and depression.\u201d\u000a\u000aA personal phone call from former Vice President Dick Cheney helped lift Payne\u2019s spirits. \u201cIt meant so much. Mr. Cheney had LVAD surgery too. He told me to have faith, stay strong and leave my depression behind,\u201d said Payne, who had met Cheney once while visiting friends in Wyoming.\u000a\u000aWhile the LVAD helped for a short while, her condition turned critical less than three months later when she developed a blood clot in the LVAD and doctors told her she needed an immediate heart transplant.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also needed a miracle,\u201d Payne said. It came in an emotional phone call from Shelly and Lulu Kane Kraft \u2013 Sammi\u2019s parents and friends of Payne\u2019s husband, Charles. \u201cThey knew about my condition, kept me in their prayers and were calling to say they wanted their daughter\u2019s passing to help me live,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWithin 48 hours, the Paynes flew to Los Angeles and Yvonne underwent transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai. \u201cThe first thing I recall when I woke up after surgery was the quiet. It was the first time my heart was really ever silent,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDirected organ donation, which Payne underwent, is not normal for emergency situations and is considered rare. Most people receive the gift of donation from an anonymous donor. For directed organ donation, blood types must be compatible between donors and intended recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Payne is devoting time and energy to offer hope to others facing heart transplants and making a similar journey through her service with the NJ Sharing Network Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cYvonne\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment is an inspiration to us all,\u201d said Elisse Glennon, executive director, NJ Sharing Network Foundation. \u201cWe are excited to be working with her. She is a dynamic person who will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goals. We are especially pleased about her commitment to outreach to minority communities and look forward to working closely with her in the coming months and years.\u201d

aVIf Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has his way, Jaime Lannister will depart Game of Thrones in a brilliant flash of dragon fire. \u201cIt has to be a dragon death,\u201d he tells me, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the dragons that get him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re on the third floor of Greenwich Steakhouse, the Village melting outside under Manhattan\u2019s first truly warm day of the year, sitting surrounded by wine racks at a table long enough for a Lannister\u2019s living room. Coster-Waldau, his Danish accent far more pronounced than it is in Westeros, his eyes a White Walker shade of piercing blue, eats a single cookie off a tiny round plate, something I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if it were not being done by the six-foot-two result of a sketch artist being asked to draw Prince Charming. This cookie should be baked with gold, and there should be hundreds more; thousands more; enough to make A Song of Ice and Fire author George RR Martin spend at least four pages describing them.\u000a\u000aCoster-Waldau is in town to promote Evan Katz\u2019s low-budget noir Small Crimes, streaming now on Netflix, but one doesn\u2019t get Jaime Lannister in a room without discussing HBO\u2019s fantasy mega-hit; and one doesn\u2019t discuss Game of Thrones, period, without eventually discussing death. Which is how we land on the actor\u2019s desire for his own character\u2014the Lannister family\u2019s stone-jawed golden boy, incestuous father of two with sister Cersei (Lena Headey), a.k.a. Kingslayer, Oathbreaker and a whole host of other unsavory epithets\u2014to wave his one-handed farewell to the consistently kill-happy series by being burnt to a crisp by Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) massive, CGI dragons.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust fried,\u201d he says, clearly relishing the idea. \u201cHe has to burn. Has to.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, whether this is speculation or spoiler is known only by an extraordinarily exclusive crew; the series, debuted in 2011 and quickly ballooned into a worldwide phenomenon, has since surpassed its A Song of Ice and Fire source material. When it returns in July for its penultimate season, we will be over The Wall and into the unknown, the plot-points existing for now only in the heads of the cast and crew, series co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and George RR Martin himself.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s something important to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: the man is a sharer, to say the least, perhaps the result of being raised in Tybjerg, a tiny village situated in the countryside of southern Zealand. Within an hour of meeting him, I knew the TV series the actor was currently hooked on (Silicon Valley, loved the premiere); I knew the poster that hung on his childhood bedroom wall (the album cover of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d); I heard the story of a young Coster-Waldau serenading his schoolmates with a Rod Stewart cover (\u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy,\u201d of course) and was filled in on some hot Tybjerg gossip from circa 1980 about the time the principal of his middle school\u2019s wife started an affair with another teacher. \u201cNo, no, it gets even better,\u201d Coster-Waldau says before I could interrupt, fully headed down memory lane at this point. (For the record, it did get better. Small-town Denmark scandal is my new favorite scandal).\u000a\u000aSo, surely, nabbing a few spoilers from the biggest show on television by conversation\u2019s end wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, would it? \u201cFor years there was the whole thing with \u2018book readers\u2019 who knew what was going to happen. But it is more intense now, because nobody knows,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cThere has been a couple times where I\u2019ve actually, by accident, said something I shouldn\u2019t have. But because nobody knows, they don\u2019t necessarily pick up on it.\u201d\u000a\u000aI get what he\u2019s saying; the anticipation for more Thrones\u2014both show and book series\u2014has reached such a fever pitch of online hypothesizing and fan theories that an actual correct guess would be lost in the noise like a musician playing the wrong note in concert.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you go online you can definitely read every plot point that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou can find the ending of Game of Thrones on the internet. It\u2019s there. But you wouldn\u2019t know. Of course, nobody really wants to know.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, I throw the journalism ethics book out the third floor Greenwich Steakhouse window to abruptly correct my interview subject; I\u2019d very much like to know, on the record, the ending of Game of Thrones. He laughs. \u201cMaybe I should try it one day. Just say, \u2018Yeah, here is exactly what happens.\u2019 You\u2019d probably just go, \u2018Pfffft, no, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s right, of course. There is no way Jaime Lannister actually dies by dragon fire, no way the actor who plays him just came out and told me because, hey, how would I even know?\u000a\u000aRight?\u000a\u000aThe look on his face at this point, so self-assuredly charming in victory, is so Lannister-esque I half expect him to pick up that cookie\u2014that one single cookie off that tiny, tiny plate\u2014with a hand made of solid gold.\u000a\u000aIn the odd-ball dark comedy Small Crimes, Coster-Waldau plays ex-police officer Joe Denton, a world-weary five o\u2019clock shadow with legs pretty much the exact diametric opposite aesthetically of Jaime Lannister\u2019s flowing hair\u2019d gallantry; where people call Jaime \u201cKingslayer,\u201d the press calls Joe \u201cSlash Cop,\u201d a nod to the knife-wielding assault charge that landed him a six-year prison sentence. We meet Joe fresh out of jail for a bloody, brutal little film that often manages to simultaneously be quite funny, in which Coster-Waldau spends a great deal of screen time getting his ass kicked with everything from a stun gun to a pair of nunchucks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love that stuff,\u201d the actor smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because he deserves it. What we tried to do, and I spoke to [writer-director Evan Katz] about this, I said \u2018we have to lean into that aspect of it, because it is such a dark story and Joe is such a scumbag.\u2019 You think it\u2019s going to be one of those movies where a guy turns his life around, and he then goes and makes every wrong decision you can possibly make. So you have to be able to laugh at him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe tried to find the humor even while he\u2019s getting beaten up. Like, when [co-star] Gary Cole tases me, it\u2019s like, you know\u2026\u201d Coster-Waldau trails off and instead convulses in his chair, tongue out and eyes bulging, in a comically over-the-top rendition of a man being tased in the stomach by well-known character actor Gary Cole.\u000a\u000aThat is another important thing to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: he\u2019s simultaneously animated and engaged, an interviewer\u2019s delight. He will answer with a specific story, a detailed childhood memory or thought-out rumination on life itself, and in lieu of an actual anecdote he\u2019ll act out an answer for you.\u000a\u000aPerfect example: When discussing his fondness for his truly immoral Small Crimes character\u2014and that fondness is delightfully palpable throughout\u2014Coster-Waldau begins by saying \u201ceven though Joe is suck a fuck-up, I still\u2026well I don\u2019t care for him but I still want to know what happens to him. I don\u2019t want to be his best buddy, but there\u2019s something about him. He\u2019s like, what\u2019s the word\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a loss, Coster-Waldau simply does a spot-on impression of a fishing lure staying afloat, bobbing relentlessly above the water\u2019s surface. \u201cJoe is like that,\u201d he goes on afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m back, I can still make it no matter what.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA running theme throughout Small Crimes is that abstract idea of \u201csecond chances\u201d; whether or not they exist, and what it then would mean to truly earn one.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do believe in second chances,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cGod knows I believe in third chances as well. But the thing is, do you believe you can actually change? Fundamentally change the person you are? I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when I press for specifics, a moment in time when the actor, be it professional or personal, was given a second chance, he draws a blank. He puts his face in his hand and thinks about it, really thinks about it because if Coster-Waldau is going to properly answer an interview question\u2014no, if he\u2019s going to offer a life lesson, he\u2019s going to find the right words. Right now, though, the only thing popping into his head is a 2014 film he starred in, quite literally titled A Second Chance.\u000a\u000aI posit, only half-jokingly, that perhaps he simply does not make mistakes.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I do. I do,\u201d he says. \u201cGod no, I have made mistakes. We all do. But I don\u2019t know about the whole idea that forgiveness is a one-off/ I\u2019ve gotten a lot of second chances. You kind of have to earn it. We have this weird belief, which is very fundamental to our culture, that forgiveness is to be given. You can just get it, you can be forgiven for anything. Which would be wonderful, because guilt is a bitch to carry around.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe brightens suddenly. \u201cI do remember one thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor launches into a story that occurred not in his career, or on the set of Game of Thrones, or even over the course of his now-19-year marriage to Greenlandic singer Nukaaka Coster-Waldau, but during his grade-school years. A classmate stole a Swedish exchange student\u2019s video game\u2014Coster-Waldau calls it \u201cone of those beep beep games,\u201d which is endlessly endearing\u2014which then ended up in his own possession.\u000a\u000a\u201cI couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of it,\u201d he remembers of harboring the contraband \u2018beep beep game.\u2019 \u201cI called another friend, and he said, \u2018You have to bring it to the principal.\u2019 It was beautiful, because it was so innocent. \u2018You have to.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe problem, Coster-Waldau tells me, is that the principal was \u201ca psychopath\u201d (one-third of the aforementioned scandalous affair, actually). But still, the young Coster-Waldau summoned his courage and returned the exchange student\u2019s console, and life in small-town Denmark moved on.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, no,\u201d Coster-Waldau laughs. \u201cThe principal actually made me feel terrible, like I was on my way to prison for probably the rest of my life. He kind of just took the game back and said \u2018you\u2019re a piece of shit, you little scumbag.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cMy point,\u201d he continues, now beaming, \u201cis that he did not give me a second chance. But just the fact that I did it actually made me feel better. It was the action, not the forgiveness. I knew that I did the right thing. Not him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich, oddly enough, brings us right back to Jaime Lannister.\u000a\u000aYou see, the incident that gave the character the title of \u201cKingslayer\u201d occurred before the events of Game of Thrones began; Jaime, still captain of the Kingsguard, drove a sword through the very king he swore to protect, Aerys II Targaryen. Which, yes, is not the best career move. What Jaime\u2019s detractors do not know is Aerys had given the order to ignite countless caches of wildfire hidden throughout the city, killing thousands of innocent people, when Jaime stepped in to stop him; a crucial fact we do not learn until a season 3 bath tub confession from Jaime to Gwendoline Christie\u2019s Brienne of Tarth.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this is true, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone? Why didn\u2019t you tell Lord Stark?\u201d asks Brienne, referring to Sean Bean\u2019s ultra-moral Eddark Stark.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?\u201d Jaime answers, one line of a performance that landed Coster-Waldau on many an Emmy Snubs list in 2013. \u201cHe judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, not to outright compare regicide with the theft of a middle-schooler\u2019s video game system, but there is a certain parallel. Jaime Lannister as a character lives a life condemned\u2014is \u201cOathbreaker\u201d really that far off from \u201clittle scumbag\u201d?\u2014because of a choice he made, that he and nearly he alone knows was right. It is, as Coster-Waldau said, the action that defines him, not anyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u000a\u000aFour seasons later, and this parallel still colors the way Coster-Waldau plays Jaime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat scene in season 3 was a very important moment,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe most important for Jaime, I think, was in that bath with Brienne. It was called \u2018Kissed by Fire,\u2019 that episode.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich is why,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI think Jaime should be killed by fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would be poetic, in its way. A perfect circle. Maybe a little\u2026too perfect? \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re watching next season. You\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, fuck.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s kidding, of course. Jaime Lannister isn\u2019t going to be burned to death in season seven of Game of Thrones. That is not, as Coster-Waldau joked before, \u201cexactly what happens.\u201d Right?\u000a\u000aPffft, no, it\u2019s not.

aVI grew up in France in the 90s, which means I was very exposed to American culture. In fact, I thought I knew it quite well when I moved here\u2014I thought I knew everything about Americans.\u000a\u000aNope.\u000a\u000aOne year after setting my bags down in California, here are a few things I\u2019ve learned about the locals. Everything that follows is, of course, completely subjective:\u000a\u000a1. Americans always believe in something\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you? What\u2019s your spirituality? What do you believe in?\u201d\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve been asked this question. And I can\u2019t express the extent to which it leaves me embarrassed and stammering (especially when the question comes up at a dinner and everyone stops talking, waiting for my response).\u000a\u000aAt first I didn\u2019t really understand. I thought they were asking me if I was religious, so I said I was the very definition of atheism. The dubious expressions this resulted in made me realize my response was not satisfactory.\u000a\u000aThe fact is, it seems that all Americans believe in something. For many, it\u2019s God, but if not, it\u2019s the almighty dollar (see point #5), past lives, reincarnation, the power of therapeutic rocks\u2026or something else.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, I don\u2019t really believe in anything other than the virtues of a glass of red wine after a hard day\u2019s work. And my only religion is making sure to cook my spaghetti \u201cal dente.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor better or worse, Americans tend to have strong convictions.\u000a\u000a2. \u201cCommunity\u201d is a sacred value\u000a\u000aIn French, the word \u201ccommunity\u201d is used primarily to indicate people of the same origin or belief system. We say, for example, the \u201cMuslim community in France\u201d or the \u201cFrench community in Los Angeles.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen I arrived in the U.S., I was surprised to hear how often people used the expression \u201cmy community\u201d (or just, \u201cmy people\u201d). This was unfamiliar to me, and it took me a while to pinpoint exactly what the word meant to Americans\u2014it was clearly more than just \u201cmy friends, colleagues, or neighbors.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver time, I came to understand that it designates a sort of \u201cchosen family,\u201d with whom you share values and who supports you in hard times. I have a theory about why this is so common here, and I could be wrong but here goes:\u000a\u000aAmericans, because they do not have a state that protects them in the same way we do, create solid, small groups within which to survive and thrive. They rely on these groups. They bond and love them. And that, for a staunch individualist like me, is a good lesson. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve come to both admire and value.\u000a\u000a3. For them, Europe is sort of one big country\u000a\u000aThis almost never fails: When I tell an American I\u2019m from France, they start recounting their numerous trips to Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, you\u2019re from Paris? I love Italy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s funny\u2014ten years ago, I went to Prague for a week.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCool, you\u2019re French? That\u2019s awesome. I loved London last year\u2014Big Ben was my fave.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince I\u2019m polite and never want to offend people, I pretend to find their accounts fascinating. I also love Italy; I\u2019ve never been to Prague; I know London well. But tell me\u2014what is the connection between that and me being from France?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s sort of like someone saying, \u201cI\u2019m from Montana,\u201d and the other person replying, \u201cOh, I just went to Maine last week\u2014great lobster rolls!\u201d\u000a\u000a4. Americans who live on the coasts don\u2019t hide their contempt for those who live in the \u201cflyover\u201d states\u000a\u000aWhen I tell Californians or New Yorkers I\u2019ve been to Oklahoma (for work, not vacation), I always wish I could film their reaction. One even responded, half-seriously, \u201cBut why? Were you being punished?\u201d\u000a\u000aIf it\u2019s true that in every country those who live in big cities look down on their rural counterparts and assume they\u2019re less progressive, the phenomenon is at its peak in the United States.\u000a\u000aEven if I am aligned far more with the values of those from California (by and large), I\u2019m still just as interested in middle America. Every time the people from there are put down, I find myself defending them as if my mother were from Oklahoma and my father from Arkansas.\u000a\u000a5. Americans (really) love money, and U.S. is a (very) capitalist country\u000a\u000aIn France, saying something like, \u201cI want to make a lot of money,\u201d comes across as vulgar, and you risk turning off whoever you\u2019re talking to. Now, God knows France is a capitalist country. But the outspoken love of money and signs of wealth are still very politically divisive.\u000a\u000aIn the U.S., my liberal friends aspire to financial wealth, and they\u2019re open about it. That has confused and honestly bothered me for a long time. However, I\u2019ve also come to understand that you can easily lose everything in this country (for example, with one health problem: read my article that is basically a love letter for Obamacare). Since grasping this, I\u2019ve become more understanding.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s in my work as a journalist that this obsession with \u201cgain\u201d has posed the biggest problem. Every time I reach out to an organization in the U.S. for an interview or segment, their communications people always ask some version of, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d They want to know what they\u2019ll get out of it, or what percentage of my piece will be devoted to them before they\u2019ll respond to my questions.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve worked with a lot of foreigners and never had to handle this kind of thing anywhere else. And it\u2019s really, really annoying.\u000a\u000a6. Americans have an extremely healthy relationship with their flag\u000a\u000aIt would have been great if someone had prepared me for what awaited me when I stepped out my door on the 4th of July in the U.S.\u000a\u000aI was at first quite surprised to cross paths with a neighbor dressed in American flag shorts. I laughed. Then I stopped laughing and started marveling as entire families clothed in the colors of the flag began filling the streets.\u000a\u000aI honestly thought I was hallucinating when I saw people in their cars with red, white and blue wigs on, driving around while flying American flags from their windows. In fact, I started taking photos discreetly to send to my friends in France, because I knew they\u2019d never believe me without proof of this phenomenon.\u000a\u000aIn France, such an obvious and enthusiastic showing of patriotism would never happen outside us winning the World Cup (let\u2019s be real about how often that happens), or presidential election events\u2014and even then, not a lot, since the French flag has become somewhat of a symbol of the far right.\u000a\u000aIn France, because pride in the flag is associated with nationalism, it\u2019s almost always suspect. Never\u2014and I mean never\u2014would you see a French flag embedded in someone\u2019s garden, and even less frequently on a t-shirt.\u000a\u000aI was invited to a 4th of July BBQ, and my housemates encouraged me to wear American colors. It\u2019s actually quite silly that we have such a complicated relationship with the flag: our colors are exactly the same, so I could have worn them for Bastille Day.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aUltimately, Americans are kind of like our distant cousins. People talk about them a lot when you\u2019re a kid, and you\u2019re shown lots of pictures of them. Maybe you envy them a bit. Then, when you finally visit them, you have this sense of familiarity, but at the same time you can tell you weren\u2019t raised in the same way.\u000a\u000aYou look at them with surprise, often.\u000a\u000aWith annoyance, sometimes.\u000a\u000aWith affection, always.\u000a\u000aHéloïse Rambert is a French journalist based in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aMelanie Curtin is a writer and sex-positive activist committed to using her voice to educate, illuminate, and uplift.

aVOften overlooked, the gut is a fascinating part of the body that does so much more than just process food. It directly influences how you think, feel and act. It\u2019s a biological marvel that\u2019s taken for granted. Here are six surprising facts about the gut:\u000a\u000a#1. It\u2019s Our Second Brain\u000a\u000aYour gut is commonly known as your second brain due to the presence of what\u2019s called the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is made up of neurons that are embedded in the walls of the gut running all the way from the mouth to the anus.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s said that there are hundreds of millions of neurons in the gut\u2014more neurons than your spinal cord and peripheral nervous system combined. This network of hormones, neurotransmitters and electrical impulses allows your second brain to communicate with your primary brain. While it may not have the decision-making skills of the brain in your head, it\u2019s beautiful and powerful in its own way.\u000a\u000a#2. You Can Heal Your Gut with Meditation and Hypnosis\u000a\u000aStudies show that stress can directly impact how you feel inside, and evidence shows it can induce and aggravate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\u000a\u000aIn addition, stress slows down the digestive process, leading to bloating, gas and indigestion. The reason for this is that stress activates the flight or fight response in the body, which diverts blood flow to the brain and limbs to prepare you to deal with the perceived threat.\u000a\u000aIf you want to keep a healthy gut, you need to relax. Research shows that stress management techniques such as hypnosis can provide relief for sufferers of IBS and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). In addition, a pilot study examined the benefits of 15 to 20 minutes of daily meditation over a nine week treatment period with a focus on stress reduction, cognitive skills, and health-enhancing behaviors, and found that meditation can help relieve symptoms of IBS and IBD in some instances.\u000a\u000a#3. It May Control Feelings of Hunger and Food Cravings\u000a\u000aTo eat or not to eat? That is the question. For a long time, it\u2019s been thought that the brain indicates whether we\u2019re hungry or full. However, it\u2019s becoming more apparent that hormones in the gut influence whether we are feeling hungry or full and communicating this to the brain\u2014rather than the other way around.\u000a\u000aIn particular, the gut hormones pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY and glucagon-like-peptide-1 are released when we eat to increase satiety and decrease food intake. On the other hand, the hormone ghrelin sends the hunger signal and works to regulate our energy needs.\u000a\u000aMore research is needed to fully understand how gut hormones affect feeding in humans. However, the results of a study conducted on lab rats led researchers to suggest that \u201cintestinal bacteria can influence appetite.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for cravings, there is also evidence that the gut may play a role in what we hanker for. Researchers have found that individuals who are \u201cchocolate desiring\u201d have different microbial breakdown products in their urine and blood plasma from those who are \u201cchocolate indifferent\u201d even when they ate the exact same diet.\u000a\u000aThis is supported by a study in which scientists showed that mice bred in an environment free of germs prefer, and will therefore consume, higher amounts of a sweet sugar solution than normal mice.\u000a\u000aThey concluded \u201cthat the absence of intestinal microbiota alters the expression of sweet taste receptors,\u201d which illustrates a direct link between gut bacteria and eating preferences. Exactly how this works in humans is not fully understood, but there is a growing amount of research that indicates the gut may be more influential that we initially anticipated.\u000a\u000a#4. It Can Influence The Way You Act\u000a\u000aA study conducted on mice found that \u201cgerm free (GF) mice display increased motor activity and reduced anxiety-like behavior\u201d when compared to normal mice. The GF mice explored more extensively, traveled further, and spent more time in potentially anxiety-inducing situations.\u000a\u000aSimilar studies have not been performed on humans, but we do know that \u201can imbalance of beneficial versus harmful gut bacteria, known as \u2018dysbiosis\u2019 has been linked to a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders such as autism, anxiety, depression and stress.\u201d\u000a\u000a#5. It Creates Acid Strong Enough to Burn Through Wood\u000a\u000aOur stomachs are filled with gastric acid. This is primarily made up of hydrochloric acid and is produced by the cells in the lining of the stomach to assist in the digestion of food, particularly proteins.\u000a\u000aThis acid helps us break down our chewed food and neutralize any potential disease or harmful bacteria before passing it to the small intestine. On average, our stomachs secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric acid everyday.\u000a\u000aAmazingly, stomach acid is strong enough to burn through wood and begin breaking down metal within 24 hours.\u000a\u000aTo make sure our stomach acid doesn\u2019t get too acidic, other cells produce bicarbonate to lower the acid level and our stomachs create mucus to build a protective barrier that prevents the acid from damaging the stomach wall.\u000a\u000aTo stop the acid going back up our esophagus and burning our throats, we have a valve that opens to let food move into the stomach but then closes to prevent anything moving back the other way. Acid reflux is what happens when acid escapes the stomach and goes back up the esophagus.\u000a\u000a#6. It Can Work Automatically\u000a\u000aUnlike the rest of the body, which requires direct input from the brain to perform a particular task, the gut doesn\u2019t need to be directed by the brain to perform its day to day functions. This is because it\u2019s the home of the enteric nervous system, an unconscious system in the body that communicates with the brain but can also act independently of it.\u000a\u000aIn fact, it\u2019s so independent that if the connection between the enteric nervous system and the brain were to be severed, the digestive system would carry on as if nothing had happened. The gut is extraordinary.\u000a\u000aTheo is a Personal Trainer, Kickboxing Instructor and the founder of Lift Learn Grow, a fitness blog that gives you the tools you need to build the body you want.

aVThe super trendy Silver Lake is ushering in a brand new poké spot, courtesy of a Sweetfin Poké expansion. They opened their sixth location on Friday.\u000a\u000aSweetfin isn\u2019t like other poké spots where the fish is questionable at best and there are no chefs in sight. Chef Dakota Weiss, known for her appearance on Top Chef, designs the menu, peppering it with signature dishes. Of course, like the majority of poké places, there\u2019s still the option to build your own bowl.\u000a\u000aThe classically trained chef worked at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead in Atlanta, the dining room at the Sunset Tower and Stephen Starr\u2019s Parc in Philadelphia. But she wanted to go back to her roots, so the fourth-generation Californian returned to Los Angeles and opened Sweetfin and then Estrella.\u000a\u000aTheir philosophy isn\u2019t farm to table, but it\u2019s close. They operate under the motto \u201cpole to bowl,\u201d only using the most sustainable fish they can find. Sweetfin also offers plenty of inventive ingredients, including sea bream, Japanese sansho pepper and lotus root (yes, you\u2019ll probably be Googling ingredients at the counter).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to be traditional poké,\u201d Weiss told the Observer. \u201cWe\u2019ve added a California/Japanese twist that people can relate to\u2014we\u2019re focused on being as healthy as possible and make everything from scratch and in-house.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd for the expansion to Silver Lake, they wanted to celebrate the tight-knit community. \u201cWe feel that its residents will be able to identify with Sweetfin\u2019s homemade and handmade ideals. Many of our furniture pieces are handmade by local artisans and we operate scratch kitchens that make our homemade sauces, toppings and bases on a daily basis,\u201d co-owner Seth Cohen explained.\u000a\u000aWhile poké gains popularity, it seems like raw fish is being served up on every corner, but no one wants to try their hand at questionable raw fish. Sweetfin isn\u2019t tossing ingredients randomly; instead, they have line cooks, not an assembly process. The sustainable fish and homemade sauces are encouraging enough to make even the most seafood averse eater try sea bream.

aVThe media and tech community lost their collective mind over the weekend in response to a 10-page document written by a (since fired) employee at Google criticizing their political culture and diversity programs.\u000a\u000a(Before reading this article any further, please make sure you\u2019ve read the original memo. You can read the unedited version here.)\u000a\u000aHere are some words that major news and media outlets have used to describe it: \u201cscreed,\u201d \u201canti-diversity,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chate speech.\u201d They\u2019ve called the author out for bigotry and sexual harassment. They\u2019ve lambasted him for encouraging the worst parts of tech culture. If you went into the document having only read the headlines and opinions on Twitter, you might assume it was watermarked with a Nazi flag and filled with racial slurs, overt sexism, and hate speech.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, Google fired him over it.\u000a\u000aBut if you truly read it, you\u2019ll be surprised to find that it\u2019s none of these things. It\u2019s an unpopular, non-politically-correct opinion\u2026but it\u2019s far from aggressive, offensive, or sexist.\u000a\u000aWhat media outlets and critics (and perhaps even Google) won\u2019t admit is that the memo is well-reasoned, calmly written, and backed by research (which I\u2019ve included below). This engineer isn\u2019t calling for an end to diversity programs or an all-powerful white-male patriarchy, but rather a rethinking of how they approach diversity hiring.\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s not even the main point of the memo. What he is primarily saying is that huge numbers of people at Google feel like they can\u2019t speak openly. That the culture stifles intellectual diversity in a company that claims to be open to any and all views. That opinions contrary to the vocal left have been silenced through shame and outrage.\u000a\u000aPerhaps somewhat predictably, the response has proven his point. The emotional outrage we\u2019ve seen, especially from media outlets, in response to the document\u2019s mere existence shows how true its main thesis is. Viewpoints that make us uncomfortable have been vilified and punished, regardless of their scientific accuracy. Holders of those viewpoints have to silence themselves for fear of public humiliation or worse, so much so that this memo had to be published anonymously. And now that he\u2019s been fired, you can imagine other Google employees will hesitate to share unpopular opinions.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll come back to that main problem, but let\u2019s dig into the memo\u2019s arguments about gender differences first: Is there any weight to what the document had to say?\u000a\u000aAre There Differences in Interests between Men and Women?\u000a\u000aThe author summarizes the main arguments of the memo as:\u000a\u000a\u201cGoogle\u2019s political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety, but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.\u000a\u000aThis silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed.\u000a\u000aThe lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology.\u000a\u000aExtreme: all disparities in representation are due to oppression\u000a\u000aAuthoritarian: we should discriminate to correct for this oppression\u000a\u000aDifferences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don\u2019t have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.\u201d\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s put their argument more simply: men and women are different; those differences might explain part of why we don\u2019t have 50/50 representation of men and women in tech and leadership, just as we don\u2019t have a 50/50 representation in oil drilling and primary education. But that opinion has been \u201cshamed into silence\u201d because Google is afraid that discussing differences between men and women may upset some people. Since employees can\u2019t express opinions that might upset people out of fear of shame or firing, the most extreme and authoritarian elements of the ideology have taken hold and go unquestioned.\u000a\u000aThe author\u2019s point, at least related to gender and diversity, is that if there\u2019s truth to general differences of interests between men and women impacting career choice, then diversity programs that try to create a perfect 50/50 split will be discriminatory against whatever gender is more interested in the field. On top of that, they\u2019ll be bad for business, since you\u2019ll have to force in less-qualified candidates to check off the diversity box.\u000a\u000aThis is all that the document is arguing about gender differences. Nowhere does it suggest that women are unqualified for engineering work, or that there shouldn\u2019t be diversity programs. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been widely misrepresented this way (which, again, is why you have to read the memo for yourself).\u000a\u000aAbout those differences in interests, though.\u000a\u000aWe can agree that, on average, men and women are physically different. Where people get uncomfortable and push back is when you suggest that men and women have mental differences. And since I know I need to keep harping on this throughout the article, different does not mean better or worse. If one person is more music oriented and one person is more writing oriented, the musician isn\u2019t better, they\u2019re just different. Pointing out differences is not offensive nor does the existence of difference imply superiority one way or the other.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s look at the points made in the memo about the mental differences between men and women. They argue:\u000a\u000aWomen on average have more openness towards feelings and aesthetics over ideas.\u000a\u000aWomen on average show a higher interest in people while men show more interest in things.\u000a\u000aWomen on average are more cooperative.\u000a\u000aWomen on average are more neurotic.\u000a\u000aWomen on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average.\u000a\u000aBecause these are the arguments in the article that have attracted the most fury, it\u2019s worth assessing each one more closely:\u000a\u000a#1: Women on average have more openness towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas\u000a\u000aThis point is a tad confusing, but the author seems to be arguing that within the Big Five trait of Openness, women tend more towards feelings and aesthetics, and men tend more towards ideas.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s research to back up women having more empathetic ability and empathy towards fairness, but it\u2019s unclear if that means that they have more interest in feelings and aesthetics. Women do fall, on average, more on the \u201cempathizing\u201d side of the Empathizing-Systematizing scale though.\u000a\u000aThe point, though, is perhaps better explained by the author\u2019s next argument:\u000a\u000a#2: Women on average show a higher interest in people while men show more interest in things\u000a\u000aThis is referencing Richard Lippa\u2019s research on \u201cGender Differences in Personality and Interests.\u201d Particularly, this part:\u000a\u000a\u201cMen tend to be much more thing-oriented and much less people-oriented than women (mean d = 1.18, a \u2018very large\u2019 difference, according to Hyde (2005) verbal designations). The Su et al. (2009) meta-analysis generated the smallest effect size (d = 0.86). However, as Su et al. note in their paper, a number of the interest inventories that fed into their meta-analysis used item selection strategies intentionally designed to reduce gender differences.\u201d\u000a\u000aEssentially, there is a very strong correlation between men and being interest in things, as well as between women and being interested in people, even when you try to use non-gender-specific things.\u000a\u000aThis research also covers the next two arguments:\u000a\u000a#3: Women on average are more cooperative\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s referred to as agreeableness in the same analysis. The association is d=0.40, so it\u2019s not as strong as the people-things association, but still big.\u000a\u000a#4: Women on average are more neurotic\u000a\u000aTo be clear, \u201cneurotic\u201d here means higher in the Neuroticism trait, and shows up in that same study with a d of 0.34. This point seems particularly inflammatory, but the data don\u2019t lie. Across 37 nations women score higher than men on neuroticism:\u000a\u000a\u201cWomen obtained higher means than men on neuroticism in all countries, and men obtained higher means than women on psychoticism in 34 countries and on extraversion in 30 countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also been reproduced here, here, and here.\u000a\u000aThese data were also supported by a meta-analysis at the University of Illinois, where they concluded:\u000a\u000a\u201cResults showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d\u2afd0.93) on the Things\u2013People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d\u2afd0.84) and Investigative (d\u2afd0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d\u2afd\u2afa0.35), Social (d\u2afd\u2afa0.68), and Conventional (d\u2afd\u2afa0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d\u2afd1.11), science (d\u2afd0.36), and mathematics (d\u2afd0.34) interests.\u201d\u000a\u000a#5: Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average\u000a\u000aThis one is not so easy to reinforce, and I wish the links had been left in the original memo. I can\u2019t find anything directly supporting this argument, but here\u2019s what I can find:\u000a\u000aMen tend to be sexually judged on status and potential (1,2). Therefore, through sexual selection, men should care more about status as a signaling mechanism, and may care more about achieving status (leadership) in the workplace. LinkedIn and Citi did a study that found men and women care fairly equally about work-life balance, however a survey by LinkedIn and Crosstab found that more women care about work-life balance than a big paycheck. The author of the memo cites this study which does back up his point.\u000a\u000aThis position is less defensible, but I\u2019m also not sure it matters. All we need to do is establish that some psychological differences exist between men and women for the diversity discussion part of the memo to be relevant.\u000a\u000aAnd it appears that those differences do exist. If you take one man and one woman off the street and expect them to exhibit these differences, there will obviously be divergences. But the literature consistently indicates that, on average, there are psychological differences between men and women. These differences appear across cultures, and across ages. These differences can emerge as early as 9 months and are seen in our primate relatives. They even occur, as the author pointed out, in at least one case when a male was castrated and raised as a female. Males and females, on average, have different interests and psychological tendencies.\u000a\u000aNow, I feel like I need to pause here and point out that, again, interests are not the same as competency. The author of the Google memo is not saying that men are better at STEM related tasks, rather, that they might be more interested in them on average, a claim that, so far, the research supports, albeit a bit indirectly.\u000a\u000aBut the more important question we have to answer now is \u201cdoes it matter?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy These Differences Matter\u000a\u000aThe author is arguing that because these differences exist, there may be differences in job interest at the population level as a result of these biological trends. Therefore, trying to create a perfect 50/50 split may be misguided compared to other more effective changes.\u000a\u000aAssuming these differences do exist, as the research seems to indicate, it\u2019s easy to see how they could affect job choice. At the most basic level: If men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people, more women will be interested in more social jobs, while more men will be interested in more mechanical jobs.\u000a\u000aThis is all the document has said about differences between the sexes. They seem to exist, and they probably influence job preference. Therefore, these differences in interests and base rates should be considered when designing effective diversity programs. Since, at least in the entry level, Google engineering is more mechanical and less social (according to the memo and confirmed by Yonatan Zunger\u2019s response linked below[1]), this may make fewer women interested in going into engineering at Google.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s roughly what the author is saying. And when you look at it next to the research, he\u2019s not making an altogether backward argument. The author isn\u2019t arguing that Google should ditch diversity programs and have an all white-male company, rather, that they need to think more pragmatically about how to approach diversity.\u000a\u000aIf you try to hire at a level of diversity different from the base rate, you\u2019ll make sacrifices. When you have 80 women and 20 men applying for a role, taking 10 of each will necessarily lead to a weaker composition than taking 16 and 4. Hiring 16 women and 4 men is fair based on the rates of applications you\u2019re getting. 20 and 0 isn\u2019t fair, and neither is 10 and 10.\u000a\u000aIf men and women are, on average, interested in different things, we can\u2019t force people to change their interests, nor should we force fit them into roles because of a commitment to a series of numbers. Diversity isn\u2019t about math; it\u2019s about culture, effectiveness, structures, and fairness.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a great line from the document:\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, most reactions to the memo have been to do the opposite. To close our eyes, try to shield people who might be offended by it, and call for the author\u2019s public hanging.\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s the bigger problem here: How everyone, particularly the media and Google, reacted to the memo.\u000a\u000aThe Bigger Problem\u000a\u000aWhat struck me most about the document was how reasonable it was.\u000a\u000aIt was well written, well argued, objective. Its goal was more effective diversity and honest dialogue. They cited their sources. It wasn\u2019t rude. The goal of the document was to push Google to work on more effective diversity programs and to point out how inflammatory of an environment Google had become towards viewpoints that didn\u2019t conform with its left-leaning political culture.\u000a\u000aThe author opened the suggestions portion of the document by making this clear:\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn\u2019t try to correct for existing biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority. My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don\u2019t fit a certain ideology.\u201d (emphasis mine).\u000a\u000aIn reacting so violently to the document\u2019s existence, the media and Google have proven the article\u2019s point. As a society, we\u2019ve become so sensitive to potentially offensive topics that we discard and demonize them to the detriment of our own effectiveness.\u000a\u000aTo truly discredit a viewpoint, the solution is not to resort to ad-hominems, but to generously interpret the argument, lay out its premises, and show where it went wrong. But if you read through the articles criticizing the memo, they do not look at it holistically or give a reasoned counter-argument to the case made by the author. They resort to shame, claims of sexism, and the now-typical outrage we see against anyone who tries goes against what\u2019s politically correct.\u000a\u000aThis is where the response from Yonatan Zunger (a former senior Googler) went wrong. His first paragraph suggests that the memo says \u201cwe should stop trying to make it possible for women to be engineers, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d And then later, he says the memo argues that \u201csome large fraction of [the author\u2019s] colleagues are at root not good enough to do their jobs.\u201d Not only does the memo not make either of these points, but the memo goes directly against Zunger\u2019s mischaracterization, since the whole point of the memo is to suggest a more effective approach towards diversity.\u000a\u000aCharacterizing the arguments in this way only makes the echo-chamber problem worse. By misrepresenting the arguments and not trying to effectively refute them, Zunger has provided evidence that Google executives truly are intolerant of views that they disagree with. If you can\u2019t accurately interpret an argument before trying to refute it, and instead misinterpret it in the most offensive way possible, all you\u2019ve done is provide rage-bait to people who already agree with you.\u000a\u000aDanielle Brown, Google\u2019s VP of Diversity, doesn\u2019t do much better. She misrepresents the memo by suggesting it discusses \u201cability\u201d instead of \u201cinterest,\u201d and then slips in the line: \u201cAnd like many of you, I found that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I\u2019m not going to link to it here as it\u2019s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.\u201d She dismissed the arguments without providing any refutation to them, even though an (admittedly small) internal survey showed that around 35% of employees agree with the document to some extent.[2]\u000a\u000aEven Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has gotten this wrong, suggesting that the memo says \u201c\u2026a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to [engineering]\u2026\u201d It simply doesn\u2019t say that.\u000a\u000aGoogle employees are smart. If Zunger, Brown, and Pichai want to convince anyone internally, instead of just trying to look good for the media, they need to show where the document goes wrong while trying their best to fairly interpret the arguments. Anything less than that is propaganda, and confirms the underlying argument of the memo.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worrisome that Google, one of the most powerful entities in the world, seems to be favoring feelings over objectivity when it was originally conceived as a tool to democratize access to information.\u000a\u000aThough many of us were force-marched through Fahrenheit 451 in high school, it\u2019s worth re-reading it now. Not only as a classic work of literature, but as a reasoned look at what happens when we choose fear of offense over truth. That\u2019s precisely how the society depicted in the novel got to the point of burning books in the first place:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must understand that our civilization is so vast that we can\u2019t have our minorities upset and stirred\u2026Coloured people don\u2019t like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don\u2019t feel good about Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Burn it. Someone\u2019s written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book.\u201d\u000a\u000aEmployees already fear voicing unpopular opinions because of what it might do to their private lives. Twitter is already shadow-banning accounts that they feel may be offensive. Is it such a stretch to imagine search results being censored because the information they contain might hurt someone\u2019s feelings?\u000a\u000aIf that happens, it\u2019ll be our fault. We won\u2019t descend into a world of censorship because a totalitarian government mandated it, or an omnipotent company decided it, but because we became so afraid of views contrary to our own that we demanded it.\u000a\u000a[1] Yonatan criticizes the argument that engineering roles favor male interests, but then he points out that at the junior level, this is true: \u201cSolitary work is something that only happens at the most junior levels\u2026\u201d While it seems that more senior engineers work in more social environments, if the entry-level roles are more mechnical, that could make them less appealing to women.\u000a\u000a[2] This is based on the charts from an internal survey which were leaked and can be found here.\u000a\u000aNat Eliason writes on his own site at nateliason.com, and you can find him on Twitter @nateliason.

aVSince speculation arose that Sen. Kamala Harris is preparing to run for president, Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters have defended her using a strategy that was developed during the 2016 Democratic primaries against Sen. Bernie Sanders. This strategy revolves around the Bernie Bros narrative, which propagates the myth that Sanders supporters are sexist, racist white males. The fact that many of progressives\u2019 criticisms, policies and grassroots efforts have been led and founded by women and people of color are, of course, ignored.\u000a\u000a\u201cKamala Harris is one of the most progressive (and attacked) leaders in America,\u201d claimed an article by former Hillary Clinton staffer Zerlina Maxwell for ShareBlue, an outlet predicated on propagating the \u201cVote Blue No Matter Who\u201d sycophancy. The thesis of the article was reminiscent of former Clinton staffer Peter Daou\u2019s defense of Hillary Clinton: \u201cHillary Clinton is one of the most ethical (and most lied about) political leaders in America.\u201d Even though bullying voters into supporting Hillary Clinton failed in 2016, the Democratic establishment is doubling down on the tactic but substituting the candidate.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic establishment\u2019s strategy of selecting candidates and throwing their support behind them treats primaries as nuisances. Primaries are meant to strengthen and grow political candidates and parties. It is undemocratic to imply that criticisms should be avoided to unite the party behind a particular candidate. The establishment\u2019s Bernie Bros narrative blames Clinton\u2019s loss on the left and propagates the assumption that no valid objections to an unvetted candidate exist.\u000a\u000aThe article made little effort to prove that Harris is progressive, and it even cited a recent bail reform bill she co-sponsored with prominent Republican Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cNo politician is perfect,\u201d argues Maxwell.\u000a\u000aOne of the most common criticisms against Harris is her decision during her tenure as California attorney general to not prosecute OneWest Bank for over 1,000 foreclosure violations. The Bank\u2019s CEO, Steve Mnuchin, donated to her 2011 California attorney general campaign and to her 2016 Senate campaign. Whistleblower Chelsea Manning also noted Harris\u2019 opposition to trans-rights as California attorney general.\u000a\u000aThese concerns were ignored in Maxwell\u2019s article, but MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid, a proponent of the Bernie Bros myth invited her to come on to MSNBC to advertise her point. On Twitter, Reid conflated campaign donations categorized by employer with corporate donations and argued, \u201cAll candidates raise money from corporate donors,\u201d which is false. It is illegal for corporations to donate directly to candidates, but the 2011 Citizen\u2019s United ruling determined that Super PACs could accept unlimited donations from these entities.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe role of a state attorney general is to act as the state\u2019s premiere law enforcement officer, and in occupying this position, Harris was essentially enforcing the will of a racist and anti-poor state \u2018justice\u2019 system (the most populous state and one of the most expansive carceral states, at that). To pretend that only white men could possibly articulate a radical critique of this political track record and trajectory is wildly disingenuous,\u201d wrote Zoe Samudzi for Verso Books in an article on the effects of deifying a politician. \u201cAs with Hillary Clinton, a gendered liberal rhetoric has emerged to defend Harris, claiming that she is being criticized because \u2018leftist bros\u2019 are resentful of and threatened by female political leadership. Liberal commentators continue to conflate the most vocal and visible contingent of Bernie Sanders supporters\u2014\u2019Bernie Bros\u2019\u2014with the entirety of the left and use this conflation to insist on dismissing \u2018the left\u2019 on the grounds of racism.\u201d\u000a\u000aHarris supporters use the Bernie Bros tactic to distract from criticisms of her record as California attorney general and the fact she has been courting wealthy Hillary Clinton donors in the Hamptons instead of working to win over voters. The Democratic establishment has decided she is a \u201crising star\u201d worthy of supporting for a potential 2020 presidential bid even before she engages with voters throughout the nation. Change needs to come through policies that benefit voters, not through exploiting candidates\u2019 race to subvert criticisms against their policies.

Black Frame Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 30 Leadership: Brian Phillips, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 With clients that read like the guest list at a party where you won't get in, Black Frame's built a mystique as a luxury PR firm with one foot firmly planted downtown. Think Visionaire, Rodarte, Opening Ceremony and uber-interior-designers Yabu Pushelberg. Bonus points for naming its website Framenoir.\u000a\u000a49. Allison + Partners Last Year\u2019s List: 41 Employees: 300 Leadership: Scott Allison, co-founder, chairman and CEO Revenue: $46 million Founded: 2001 Despite the firm's SF roots, Allison + Partners' center of gravity has shifted to the Big Apple, now home to the largest team in its global network. Talent's where the firm is ruling; hires have landed from places like Edelman and Ogilvy. And the client roster's been fattened by the likes of Samsung, Adecco and Seventh Generation.\u000a\u000a48. The Magrino Agency Last Year\u2019s List: 47 Employees: N/A Leadership: Susan Magrino, chairman and CEO; Allyn Magrino, president and COO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 Susan and Allyn Magrino have built a lifestyle-PR powerhouse, with clients who now involve them in brand strategy before a product even launches. It's also a matchmaking pioneer, connecting, say, Richard Meier with Dom Perignon for a special edition. Despite brutal competition from upstarts like M18, the firm's more than held its own, with a food-hospitality-fashion stable that includes Baccarat, Lavazza, Hilton properties and Turnberry Isle.\u000a\u000a47. Boneau/Bryan-Brown Last Year\u2019s List: 44 Employees: 16 Leadership: Chris Boneau, Adrian Bryan-Brown, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 More than 200 BBB clients have won Tony Awards, cementing its place as the top name in theatre PR. Broadway\u2019s biggest hits, including The Book of Mormon and Jersey Boys, rely on the firm\u2019s smart strategy\u2014and upcoming partnerships with Cirque du Soleil and Nickelodeon mean BBB clients will continue to be conversation starters. Still, we're watching to see how DKC's acquisition of O & M affects the category (see DKC listing).\u000a\u000a46. High10 Media Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Lisa Dallos, CEO; Evan Strome, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 Lisa Dallos' media-centric firm is the only one whose team includes one employee in Maine and one in Tel Aviv. Whatever\u2014the firm's been killing it for media brands from Adweek to the Webby and Clio Awards to The Hill and New Republic magazines. And if you're wondering why the sale of a Manhattan gay bar rag to an L.A. media group was featured in the Hollywood Reporter this year, thank Ms. Dallos.\u000a\u000a45. APCO Worldwide Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Margery Kraus, founder and executive chairman Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 What started as a wonky D.C. agency has mushroomed into a brainy powerhouse with clients like IKEA, Wyndham hotels, and Microsoft, and leadership like ex-WSJ editor Kevin Goldman; from a staff of five, its NYC office now employs 50 and counting.\u000a\u000a44. Baltz & Company Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 29 Leadership: Phillip Baltz, founder and president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1998 With a profile so low he's practically underground, Phillip Baltz prefers to let his work do the talking. You would, too, with superstar restaurant clients like Dirt Candy, Pearl & Ash, Jonathan Waxman\u2019s JAMS, Beauty and Essex, Kat & Theo and...Chipotle.\u000a\u000a43. Dukas Linden Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Richard Dukas, chairman and CEO; Seth Linden, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2002 Dukas may have cost John Paulson $500 million this year. That wasn't its retainer; DLPR client Carson Block, a prominent short-seller, famously took down Chinese timber outfit Sino-Forest Corp., which subsequently tanked. Dukas itself had a better 2015, coming off the best stretch in its 13-year history\u2014and cracking $5 million for the first time. Broadcast is where the agency shines; if you're ever tuned into Bloomberg TV, CNBC or Fox, you've probably seen one of the 60-plus segments the firm books monthly for clients like Raymond James, EisnerAmper and Eaton Vance.\u000a\u000a42. The Peggy Siegal Company Last Year\u2019s List: 40 Employees: N/A Leadership: Peggy Siegal, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 If you want your movie to get into the Oscar race, it helps to have Peggy Siegal by your side. This year, the queen of film PR is handling publicity on both coasts for Spotlight and The Danish Girl, among others. Her secret? Lunchtime Q&As with top filmmakers, held at venues like the 21 Club. Ms. Siegal refers to these events as \u201ca press conference wrapped around a piece of chicken.\u201d\u000a\u000a41. PR Consulting Last Year\u2019s List: 30 Employees: N/A Leadership: Pierre Rougier, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 PR Consulting's website simply lists its clients. Since the agency's Sphinx-like about itself, we'll let the roster do the talking for founder Pierre Rougier: Hood by Air, Dior, Raf Simons, Rick Owens, LVMH, Dries Van Noten, Narciso Rodriguez, Christopher Kane, Versace. Oh, and Forever 21 and Joe Fresh. The firm's also expanded into food and hospitality, with Andre Balazs a notable client\u2014and it may be courting Grindr as well.\u000a\u000a40. Goodman Media Last Year\u2019s List: 19 Employees: 25 Leadership: Tom Goodman, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1996 Flashier firms may get the glory, but Tom Goodman's 25-person shop continues to get clients that matter, from The Economist to Grand Central Terminal to the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. A complete New York insider, founder Mr. Goodman surprised more than a few people by opening an office in Boston this year.\u000a\u000a39. Golin Last Year\u2019s List: 36 Employees: 1,000-plus Leadership: Fred Cook, CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 Golin likes to call its reps "nice guys who kick ass," and that was certainly true this year, as its campaigns focused on positivity, but still got plenty of eyeballs. Among the firm's 2015 triumphs: partnering with Toyota for the Special Olympics World Games (Golin was the brains behind that viral Google Doodle) and rolling out the McDonald\u2019s All Day Breakfast campaign.\u000a\u000a38. Nicholas & Lence Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 39 Employees: 12 Leadership: Cristyne Nicholas, CEO; George Lence, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2007 A quintessentially New York agency founded by deeply connected insiders, this firm represents city institutions like Michael Jordan's Steakhouse in Grand Central, the forthcoming New York Wheel on Staten Island, and Key Brand, the leading theater ticket seller, which owns brands like Broadway Box and Broadway.com. Does it get more New York than literally repping the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Foundation? Naturally, big city clients sometimes bring big city problems -- the Carnegie Deli has been closed since April when it was found to have an illegal gas hookup. But others\u2014like 2015 NASL Champions The NY Cosmos and Brookfield, the developer who led a successful opening of Brookfield Place and dipped a toe in Brooklyn\u2014show that an NYC-focused firm can punch way above its weight.\u000a\u000a37. MWW Last Year\u2019s List: 20 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Kempner, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1986 MWW has its feelers in just about every sector of PR\u2014its many clients with commercial appeal include Verizon, Walgreens and JetBlue. It\u2019s also entered some areas other agencies fear to tread\u2014its LGBT wing, which represents It Gets Better, among others, looked particularly prescient after the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage equality ruling.\u000a\u000a36. Nasty Little Man Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 6 Leadership: Steve Martin, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 This firm may only have six employees, but its supernova clientele (Paul McCartney, David Bowie, U2) proves that in NYC PR, size doesn\u2019t always matter. Mr. Martin can be ferocious in defending his acts from unflattering coverage, including from his bête noir, the Observer\u2019s own Tim Sommer, but they love him for it. The Foo Fighters thought they were in big trouble when Dave Grohl broke his leg on the band\u2019s 20th anniversary tour, but once NLM rebranded it as the \u201cBroken Leg\u201d tour, the rockers continued to sell out stadiums.\u000a\u000a35. Paul Wilmot Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 32 Employees: N/A Leadership: Paul Wilmot, managing partner and chief executive Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 Paul Wilmot's august fashion and beauty firm always manages to stay cool by choosing clients carefully; this year, it lent its cachet to client Parlux Fragrances, creators of new scents from Rihanna and Sean Combs. Wilmot's forever relationships with Kate Spade, H&M and Lane Bryant also mean its third decade is already looking as strong as its first two.\u000a\u000a34. Brunswick Group Last Year\u2019s List: 29 Employees: N/A Leadership: Steven Lipin, senior partner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1987 Brunswick doesn't divulge client lists, but its reputation as an 800-pound gorilla in financial communications precedes it. This year, the multinational firm added former Bloomberg editor Laurie Hays to its NYC office, and its let-our-hair-down digital/creative subsidiaries like MerchantCantos, Brunswick Arts and Blaise Projects keep cranking.\u000a\u000a33. KCD Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Ed Filipowski, worldwide president and chief strategist; Julie Mannion, president of creative services Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 KCD is a fashion Goliath whose industry-defining clients include style-section habitués like Alexander Wang, Balmain, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang and Tory Burch. Along with publicity, the agency produces shows, which means it wields serious power; KCD decides where everyone's seated.\u000a\u000a32. ID-PR Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 100 Leadership: Kelly Bush Novak, founder and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1993 The ubiquity of client Serena Williams this summer\u2014how many magazine covers did she get?\u2014was just one example of ID\u2019s juice. Building on its roots in celeb/entertainment PR, where it still shines, the firm's making serious inroads with consumer and luxury brands, from Coca-Cola, AOL and Marriott to Westfield World Trade Center and Tiffany. Philanthropy's the next frontier: this year saw massive campaigns for deep-pocketed do-gooders like Unicef and Sean Penn's J/P HRO.\u000a\u000a30. 5W PR Last Year\u2019s List: 35 Employees: 125 Leadership: Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO Revenue: $21.5 million Founded: 2003 A generalist firm with fingers in the right pies\u2014from health care and hedge funds to tech and travel\u20145W's roster includes uber-New Yorky brands like Duane Reade, the Greater NY Taxi Association and Derek Jeter's Stop!t, along with global heavyweights like Unilever, L'Oreal and Krups. Founder Ronn Torossian claims the firm's revenue could double within five years; we don't doubt it. He also brokered an unlikely peace between Mayor de Blasio and client Sergeant\u2019s Benevolent Association.\u000a\u000a29. Sunshine Sachs Last Year\u2019s List: 1 Employees: 154 Leadership: Ken Sunshine, Shawn Sachs, Heather Lylis, Keleigh Thomas Morgan, partners Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 How could they? That was the reaction to Sunshine Sachs' much-publicized Wikipedia screwup. It's a shame that the incident defined the agency's year, since last year's No. 1 firm is still having an incredible ride with giant nonprofit clients, A+ celebrities and massive growth in live events, like iHeartRadio's nationwide festivals. But it\u2019ll be a while before chatter stops about the Wikipedia episode.\u000a\u000aThey may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world. Hotels, its original client base, still bed down with M18 in droves. Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a11. M18 Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Tavani and Meghan McGinnis, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 They may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world. Hotels, its original client base, still bed down with M18 in droves. Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a27. Nadine Johnson Inc. Last Year\u2019s List: 21 Employees: N/A Leadership: Nadine Johnson, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1995 Ms. Johnson's agency famously doesn't divulge client names, but it's known for sexy/artsy brands like Ace Hotels along with galleries, architects and high-end residential projects. The agency's still got serious juice, but suffered a blow this year when arts practice leader Adam Abdalla left to start his own firm, Cultural Counsel, as the Observer reported in July (see sidebar). Stay tuned.\u000a\u000a26. Shore Fire Media Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Marilyn Laverty, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1990 The rotating playlist on Shore Fire\u2019s homepage speaks volumes about the firm\u2019s reach; Bonnie Raitt, Lana Del Rey, Zac Brown, Carole King, Brandi Carlile, Elvis Costello, Tedeschi Trucks Band and St. Vincent are all clients. In its 25th year, this music PR pioneer saw its clients grab the No. 1 spots on the Billboard, iTunes, Apple Music and Amazon charts. This year, Shore Fire expanded its repertoire with non-music clients like publishing mogul Maria Rodale and Tuesdays with Morrie author Mitch Albom. Shore Fire was also one of the first communications firms to HQ itself in Brooklyn; the move seems prescient now.\u000a\u000aWhat does $6.5 trillion look like? Ask Jennifer Prosek.

And if you have the creativity, and the ability to execute, it\u2019s a time of great possibilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat matters most is who owns a great idea, agrees Sean Cassidy, CEO of DKC, the No. 1 agency on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list.\u000a\u000a\u201cClients will pay you now for a whole scope of services that you never would have done 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Cassidy says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re winning now is large-scale assignments. You\u2019re developing multi-platform communications plans with wide content, owned media, social pieces. We\u2019ve got a branding arm that\u2019s creating collateral and advertising, and we\u2019re doing more events than ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore firms are also building their own synergies with standalone agencies within agencies. At celebrity power shop PMK*BNC, a mini-firm called Vowel is creating viral content through which the agency\u2019s superstar celebrity clients often get paired with big brands in the PMK stable. A now-legendary piece for Audi starring Zachary Quinto and the late Leonard Nimoy was unleashed before the last Star Trek movie.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was wonderful, creative digital content that was storyboarded start to finish under our roof,\u201d says Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of PMK*BNC (No. 8). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of freedom out there for you and your clients. You just have to know what trail you want to go on.\u201d PMK markets Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cLenny Letter\u201d, which has become a huge viral hit in an area where a traditional firm wouldn\u2019t have ventured even five years ago.\u000a\u000aAn unintended consequence of this push and pull\u2014convergence and diffusion\u2014has been the resurgence of legacy agencies, which many had dismissed as dinosaurs once the landscape started shifting a few years ago.\u000a\u000aInstead, they learned to adapt, meshing cool new tools and lingo with their own gravitas as the grownups in the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe bring the judgment and experience that goes along with strategic thinking,\u201d says Mr. Baer of Burson, which launched a content arm called StudioB this year. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seasoning it with data, creativity and deep knowledge of media landscape. We\u2019re moving forward very assertively.\u201d\u000a\u000aSixty-seven-year-old Ruder Finn (No. 10), not long ago one of the stodgiest of the big players, has reinvented itself as a hip think tank, where clients get help with employee engagement, recruitment and even how their businesses are organized. \u201cWe call it ideation behind transformation,\u201d says CEO Kathy Bloomgarden, one of the few agency heads with a Ph.D. \u201cWe work to transform companies to make them more attractive to stakeholders both inside and outside. We sometimes help them change their culture.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll of it comes back to storytelling, says Weber Shandwick\u2019s Mr. Polansky, which is why PR firms should continue to rule.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreative is still king,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are looking for big ideas that are going to move the needle for their businesses, have an impact on how people think about their brands and influence decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s list reflects that.\u000a\u000aA word on methodology: Unlike other rankings, the Observer doesn\u2019t rely solely on size or revenue. We visit offices, meet agency leaders, confer with fellow journalists and keep an eye on news. The PR Power 50 list is as much about mojo, influence, innovation and chutzpah\u2014but not too much, as last year\u2019s No. 1 winner learned\u2014as it is about billables.\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t that what the business is about, too?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVAs Conde Nast looks set to announce consolidation of its publishing division following similar changes at Hearst Magazines last year, other, smaller players in the sector have better news. New York-based niche magazine, Paper, just celebrated its 32nd successful year in print. Meanwhile, in Munich, Germany, Platea, an independent art and fashion magazine, rejoiced its snowballing readership. The quarterly magazine targeted at young creatives has been in business for less than two years and already garnered a loyal audience within Europe. Likewise, The Gentlewoman, a magazine based in London aimed at intellectual women with \u201cstyle and purpose,\u201d has been growing exponentially throughout a seven year run.\u000a\u000aVestoj, Dazed and Confused, Love, Kinfolk, V, Interview, and System are independent magazines, some names less familiar than others, enjoying growing success while their mainstream counterparts such as Instyle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan have shown a consistent drop in circulation. At a time when print is seemingly waning with many titles now transitioning to digital-only, the success of mainly fashion-based indie magazines seems puzzling. Yet, a quick look through any of them reveals one simple ingredient: contemporary voices and a deeper connection with the audience. The content and design appeals to those attracted by new, avant-garde inspiration and is unfettered by fashion advertising behemoths. This is not to say though, that fashion brands are not on board. Many are lining up for space in the most influential spots and the kudos of appearing alongside raw, emerging talent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNiche and indie magazines are very in touch with their audience, they tend to be lean mean fighting machines, often run by a single person who can nimbly engage with their audience far more easily than a mainstream magazine that\u2019s often weighed down by too many people involved in the decision making & production process,\u201d James Hyman told observer.com. Hyman is founder of The Hyman Archive in London, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest collection of magazines.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost independent titles consist of small teams, often dispersed across different parts of the world. Instead of self-aggrandizing and building personal brands, niche editors are motivated by a sense of purpose and enthusiasm for their publication\u2019s cultural role. The key word here is \u2018niche,\u2019 something most commercial fashion magazines have lost sight of, with far too many similarities between them. \u201c[Independent] magazines have smaller teams and lower overheads, and are published less often. Smaller teams mean more focused, controlled decision-making. The mainstream, on the other hand, has commoditized itself and become repetitive, and more concerned with business rather than being creatively focused,\u201d explained Jeremy Leslie, creative director at MagCulture, one of the most respected magazine stores in London stocking over 350 different titles.\u000a\u000aHe added that most mainstream magazines are now at a point where they don\u2019t have a voice of their own and have become clones in terms of both character and physical nature, \u201c [They\u2019re] all the same size, same paper, same number of pages. Straight in the recycle bin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertising pressures are one of the top reasons for the decline in the quality of content in traditional print titles. A source close to I-D, a British art, fashion and youth culture magazine confirmed how it lost a chunk of its readership as their content became more commercially driven, after being bought by Vice in 2012, a multimedia company partly owned by Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new I-D magazine is just another place to view cool work\u2014no thoughtful criticism or fascinating narrative that once made it worth reading,\u201d noted an agitated user on a reddit thread.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you need to please advertisers, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to take risks and when you\u2019re aiming for demographics, you\u2019re not going to go out on a limb and do something really different,\u201d said Steven Watson, founder at Stack Magazines, a subscription service that selects and delivers new, independent titles to users every month.\u000a\u000aAlthough independent publications don\u2019t have mighty commercial obligations at their heels, they do need support. Penny Martin of The Gentlewoman, noted that although they are growing, with \u201ca very healthy advertising quotient of around 30 percent,\u201d they don\u2019t let that interfere with the content, \u201cWe are working with companies who respect our independent ideals and understand that a magazine publishing long form articles and lavishing space on typography and design has fewer pages to display product.\u201d\u000a\u000aTypically created with an immense attention to detail plus great design and photography and in some cases better paper quality\u2014some small titles become minor works of art. \u201cI wanted to do print to have a platform to cherish the content I collect. It has a stronger appearance and is more special. It doesn\u2019t get thrown away. Crafting magazines is an art form and a lot of people are involved and brought together to create something that you can touch and feel. It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Tristan Boettcher, editor in chief at Platea.\u000a\u000aWatson added that the superior quality of these young titles has made them a luxury product and more collectible than the old guard. \u201cIt\u2019s in part a response to the mainstream which over the last 10 years has reduced the thickness of the paper to make it cheaper and reduced the budgets because of falling revenues. So now a group of independent magazine makers have decided, \u2018Magazines don\u2019t have to be like this, we can print magazines in beautiful thick paper, with beautiful typography and design and we could charge £10 for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy becoming an indispensable item, the indie magazine circuit is also winning the print versus digital debate, where online media just can\u2019t offer the quality or longevity that these publications do.\u000a\u000aWatson argued that niche publications don\u2019t see digital as competition or a threat but as a tool to further their own popularity. \u201cI think it\u2019s really about what makes your product different from everything else. Build everything around that thing. Then not only does it become something that you can\u2019t get online, you can\u2019t get that anywhere else. That is really the magic of these publications.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis doesn\u2019t mean the bells are tolling for all traditional magazines. U.S Vogue, for instance, consistently re-invents content, featuring youthfully influential and diverse personalities and blasting a hole in tradition with the controversial but ultimately successful, Kimye cover. Modern publishing requires a rethinking of purpose. Leslie advised that it is all about striking a balance between familiarity and repetition, and celebrating the possibilities of the manufacturing process without losing its uniqueness, \u201cCreatively, print is bang in the center of a hugely innovative golden age. Just be sure of your magazine\u2019s point of view and personality and don\u2019t be a cheap copy.\u201d

aVEmpowerment can go a long way and there is nothing more empowering than being your own boss. The digital age has opened up many opportunities for people all over the world and starting a business today is easier than ever. All one needs is an internet connection and the unlimited opportunities are here.\u000a\u000aIn this article, I\u2019ll talk about startups that are empowering people to start a business no matter the location, gender or income.\u000a\u000aRevolut\u000a\u000aBenjamin Franklin used to say that, \u201ca penny saved is a penny earned.\u201d Nowadays, most of the business owners realize that in fact, a dollar saved is even better than a dollar earned, since you do not pay extra tax for it.\u000a\u000aHowever, if you travel a lot, most of the time you cannot keep your savings as it is due to many different issues. They all derive from the traditional banking: ATM fees, bank currency exchange rates, transaction charges to name a few.\u000a\u000aDespite that, all the great visionaries see problems as business opportunities. In 2015, Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko founded Revolut\u2014a just and frictionless mobile-first service to manage money all around the globe.\u000a\u000aRevolut cuts most of the extra banking costs by providing real exchange rates, no transfer fees, no annual account costs and free monthly $200 ATM withdrawal limit (+ 2% per withdrawal after that), which means no more hidden markups for simple everyday transactions. In other words, it is a traveler\u2019s best companion.\u000a\u000aRevolut aims to do what its name suggests\u2014revolutionize today\u2019s banks. It provides a prepaid multi currency card with a digital wallet along with other premium features at the lowest cost possible. It is as if you had a bank account in every country you are visiting.\u000a\u000aThus, it is safe to say that Revolut is a legit twenty-first-century banking alternative designed for a truly empowering and global lifestyle.\u000a\u000aSellfy\u000a\u000aWhen starting a business, it is critical to think of a right distribution channel. The digital age has simplified this process, but the competition is fierce. Especially if you are a digital indie creator.\u000a\u000aThe idea behind Sellfy is to streamline the selling process and allow creators to sell their digital content with ease. In fact, what is more empowering than the ability to instantly share your eBooks, comics, music, videos or any other kind of digital assets with thousands of potential buyers?\u000a\u000aSellfy\u2019s mission is to empower creators from all over the world to earn a living by doing what they love. If you have a downloadable file that you want to sell, all you need to do is create an account, upload your digital goods and you are ready to start selling within minutes.\u000a\u000aThe best part about Sellfy is that you can easily create one-click purchase button that allows you to sell digital products directly to your fans and followers on your website, social media channels or your Sellfy storefront. Over 100,000 people support the community, so even if you do not have a huge following on your site or social media, there\u2019s still a good chance for your products to be discovered and bought.\u000a\u000aLeapIN\u000a\u000aWhen most of the startups today try to engage their consumers and sell products, LeapIN, in simple words, sells legal access to the European market. It can only mean one thing: geographical barriers are increasingly less important.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, World Economic Forum has announced that Estonia is the leading entrepreneurial country in Europe. And rightfully so\u2014Estonians innovative solutions, such as an e-Residency program have created opportunities for thousands of people everywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aLeapIN is a subscription based service that strives to simplify the process of starting a micro business in the EU. The service is based on the Estonian e-Residency. For example, a Mexican entrepreneur can establish an Estonian company, run it from Japan and serve the clients in France.\u000a\u000aBesides the access to the EU, LeapIN takes care of bookkeeping and taxes, bank account and payment card, company registration, business administration and optimization, all while you can focus on engaging your customers, sales or product development.\u000a\u000aLeapIN\u2019s team believes that starting a business should be as easy as possible. Therefore, they offer a unique proposition\u2014location independent business management solution in one of the best countries to run a business. If that is not empowering, then nothing is.\u000a\u000aTransferWise\u000a\u000aTransferWise is another empowering startup that seeks to disrupt banking as we know it. It is one of the best market choices for quick and cheap international money transfers and claims to be almost eight times less expensive than the traditional banks.\u000a\u000aThe most interesting thing about TransferWise is that the money sent abroad never leaves the country. Instead, the system communicates with other TransferWise\u2019s bank accounts in the foreign countries and sends money to the recipients from there. It means that no actual conversion takes place. That allows TransferWise to maintain the lowest costs.\u000a\u000aIn a way, TransferWise appears to be similar to Revolut and they even have some overlapping features, but they are not to be confused. TransferWise delivers superior remittance services for the bank to bank transfers, while Revolut offers a debit card that is suited for foreign purchases. In other words, TransferWise is a choice for expats and locals while Revolut is an excellent option for international travelers.\u000a\u000aCoach\u000a\u000aIf you are good at something, never do it for free. Coach is a platform designed for tutors and freelancers to build an online business based on their skills. Coach\u2019s philosophy is simple \u2013 everyone should be able to have a job they love.\u000a\u000aIn its essence, Coach is a website for those, who never stop learning and improving and want to share their knowledge with the world.

When in reality, many people are working hard to make it as easy as possible for everyone.\u000a\u000aNo matter who or where you are, with some effort it is possible to save or make some extra money, as long as you stay open to the opportunities that come along your way.\u000a\u000aTomas Laurinavicius is a traveling lifestyle entrepreneur and blogger from Lithuania.

aVChristie\u2019s will offer items from the expansive collection of Thermo Electric heir and arts patron Paul F. Walter in a two day sale this September, according to an announcement from the auction house. On September 26 and 27, Christie\u2019s will offer over 560 lots from the collector\u2019s Manhattan and Sag Harbor homes, including furniture and decorative arts, sculpture, Indian art, post-war and contemporary art and photography.\u000a\u000aWalter, who died in January of this year, was the son of New Jersey-based industrial instruments company Thermo Electric\u2019s founders, Fred and Anna Walter. He inherited a passion for the arts from his parents\u2014also active cultural benefactors\u2014and went on to hold leadership positions at both MoMA and the Met, in addition to taking the reigns at Thermo Electric in 1968. He was known just as much for his collecting as he was his lending and financial support of arts institutions, according to Christie\u2019s, and gifted significant photography holdings to both institutions, including works by Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson. In his lifetime, Walter also gifted works to Oberlin College, LACMA and the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat united Paul\u2019s aesthetic was his true passion for collecting\u2014and it was phenomenal,\u201d said Laura Paulson, vice chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas advisory board said in a statement. \u201cHe would create highly personal environments with great attention to detail and beauty, and this translated into everything he brought into his life.\u201d\u000a\u000aHighlights of the sale include early photographs from Captain Linnaeus Tripe, Edward Steichen and Man Ray, in addition to an archive of photos, sketch books and manuscripts which once belonged to Beaton.\u000a\u000aAlso included are works on paper from Brice Marden and Agnes Martin, and pieces by Robert Mapplethorpe and Robert Wilson, along with examples of English furniture and designs from the Arts and Crafts movement, and a significant selection of Indian Art,\u000a\u000aWorks sale are valued between $1,000 and $1.2 million, and the sale is predicted to total near $4.5 million.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Collection of Paul F. Walter\u201d will be sold September 26-27 at Christie\u2019s New York.

aVIn today\u2019s market, it\u2019s not all together unusual for an artwork to surface at an auction and sell for thousands, even millions, more than what it was initially worth when it was first produced. Case in point, Pop artist Andy Warhol\u2019s famous \u201cBrillo Box\u201d sculpture, which is now the subject of a forthcoming HBO documentary, titled BRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) and premiering August 7, according to a press release.\u000a\u000aThe film traces the epic story of one of Warhol\u2019s original, signed Brillo Boxes, first bought in 1969 for $1,000 by newlywed art collectors Martin and Rita Skyler, and after an impressive, successive list of owners (including Gagosian gallery founding director Robert Shapazian and Charles Saatchi) the work was eventually sold at Christie\u2019s in 2010 for just over $3 million.\u000a\u000aHow could an artwork, seemingly simple in its construction and concept and lampooned by critics, accumulate so much in value over the span of forty years? Martin and Rita\u2019s daughter Lisanne, who has written, directed and produced the new film, seeks to find an answer by closely following the Brillo\u2019s Box\u2019s story, from its early years in her family\u2019s home to the stunningly 2010 sale at Christie\u2019s.\u000a\u000aSkyler\u2019s film captures reactions from her parents as they recall discovering the remarkable rise in value of the artwork they traded in 1971 in exchange for a piece by Peter Young, as well as expert analysis from Christie\u2019s chairman of the Americans Laura Paulson, Philadelphia Museum of Art curator Jessica Todd Smith, Warhol Museum former director Eric Shiner and critic and historian Irving Sandler, among others.\u000a\u000aBRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) will premiere on HBO the day after what would have been Warhol\u2019s 89th birthday, at 10 p.m. ET.

aVAlex Israel is a youngish L.A. artist whose pastel-color panel paintings look like the sets of \u201980s porn flicks; they\u2019ve been selling like hotcakes at chic galleries in Paris and Berlin. I tried to see his recent one-man show at the übercool and cutting-edge Lower East Side gallery Reena Spaulings Fine Art, but the gallery is so übercool and cutting edge that, on the Friday afternoon I chose for my visit, it wasn\u2019t even open. In fact, the two times I have ventured to this gallery in an attempt to see an exhibition, during regular gallery hours, they have managed to have the doors locked and the lights turned off. I\u2019d given up on writing about Mr. Israel\u2019s work, when I realized that I could simply review his new TV show, As It LAys, the one he\u2019s recently uploaded to You Tube and for which he created a website: www.asitlays.com. This interview show, with Mr. Israel as host, reminds me of Andy Warhol\u2019s famous \u201cScreen Tests\u201d: both projects are, in superficially different but actually very similar ways, forms of video portraiture.\u000a\u000aThe so-called \u201cScreen Tests\u201d that Warhol made in the early \u201960s weren\u2019t really screen tests at all. Warhol shoved his camera in his subject\u2019s face and did a two-and-a-half-minute film. Whether it was a factory regular like Edie Sedgwick or Lou Reed, or some celebrity like Bob Dylan or Salvador Dalí, didn\u2019t really matter, because in the end all the subjects were just meat to grind in Warhol\u2019s lens, reminders that youth, beauty, sex, fame and fortune exist only in the moment.\u000a\u000aBefore As It LAys, Mr. Israel\u2019s claim to fame was that he was once an assistant to the late L.A. artist Jason Rhoades and served as the doorman for Rhoades\u2019s infamous \u201cBlack Pussy Soirée Cabaret Macramé\u201d parties. Now Mr. Israel has succeeded in taking the Warhol screen test to a whole new level by doing interviews with celebrities and quasi-celebrities in which he reads a series of bizarre and awkward questions\u2014to Rachel Zoe, \u201cIf you were to create the perfect salad, what would be the key ingredients?\u201d\u2014from a set of index cards he shuffles in his hands. His subjects are left trying to tell a personal story without help or support from their interlocutor. Mr. Israel\u2019s portraits, which seem to both emerge from and comment on the current Facebook/Twitter sound bite zeitgeist, are painful in the way Warhol\u2019s once were: they exist in an existential space devoid of human emotion or sympathy.\u000a\u000aUnlike Warhol\u2019s project, for the most part, Mr. Israel\u2019s guests are older, passé. They are walking, talking pieces of L.A.\u2019s cultural history. Taken together, they represent a sampling of L.A. personalities who were once at the center of the scene but now have one foot\u2014or, in some cases, both feet\u2014out the door.\u000a\u000aA TV-style interview where the questions are read right off note cards in a harsh and empty environment is a strange thing to watch. But only a few of Mr. Israel\u2019s victims realize they are being set up; most of them just writhe and sweat in their seats. I feel their pain. In the end I was left wondering: what is it like to have once been famous and important in L.A.? What comes after that?\u000a\u000aHis questions run the gamut from banal to bizarre. Adrienne Maloof, a reality-TV \u201chousewife of Beverly Hills,\u201d is asked, \u201cDid you ever cheat on a test?\u201d She answers without hesitation, \u201cNo, I helped others, the whole football team.\u201d Yet she never seems to reflect on what she just revealed to us, namely her relations with the \u201cwhole football team.\u201d Restaurateur Mr. Chow is asked, \u201cIn the battle between people and robots who wins?\u201d His answer should have been \u201cGet lost,\u201d but instead he responds, \u201cNature is more precise than a machine, every leaf is unique, just like every thumbprint \u2026 a robot is a machine and therefore has limitations.\u201d And it\u2019s funny! It gets worse when 71-year-old singer-songwriter Paul Anka is asked, \u201cChocolate or vanilla?\u201d and gives a three-minute monologue. Or when Jon Peters, the once-famous film producer and head of Sony pictures (and ex-Barbra Streisand hairdresser) gets caught in a trap when he\u2019s asked, \u201cAre you a good storyteller?\u201d and answers, with candor, \u201cWhen I was a kid I was more of a liar, but when I grew up I made those lies into a fantasy.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir moment in the spotlight may be over, but all of these guests are still dead set on proving their relevance, so much so that they are willing to talk at length to this unknown artist/interviewer. Most of them end up, tragically, revealing their hollow \u201cscreen test\u201d side. L.A. is a city obsessed with youth and power; it must not be very pleasant to feel marginalized in a place where you were once the center of attention.\u000a\u000aThat said, it\u2019s not all tragedy. At 95, Phyllis Diller gets credit, in my book, just for showing up. When asked, \u201cAre you reading anything?\u201d she supplies the riposte, \u201cI cannot read. I am losing my eyesight.\u201d Other interviewees didn\u2019t have such an easy out, and that makes for moments that are strangely poignant. Asked, \u201cWhat do you want the world to know about you?\u201d the seven-time NBA All-Star James Worthy replies, uncomfortably, \u201cBasketball is what I did for a living but it\u2019s not who I am as a person.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are some deliciously awkward moments. Cheryl Tiegs, the ravishing beauty who in 1975 graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, doesn\u2019t fare very well; she reveals that her favorite karaoke song is \u201cAt Last\u201d by Etta James. Quincy Jones is asked, \u201cWhat is your favorite color?\u201d Doesn\u2019t he remember the scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail when Sir Galahad is asked the very same question and answers: \u201dblue \u2026 uh, no \u2026 green\u201d and gets tossed down a ravine for his \u201cmistake\u201d? Clearly he doesn\u2019t, because he sheepishly answers, \u201cPurple, um \u2026 and lime, black and uh \u2026 orange,\u201d then gives the camera a pained smile. Perhaps the most cringe-worthy of the interviews is the one with JFK\u2019s nephew Bobby Shriver, who is painfully politically correct. \u201cWho would you most like to meet?\u201d he is asked, and he implausibly replies, \u201cI once opened the door to a room and there was Luciano Pavarotti \u2026 it was too much for me.\u201d How absurd for this to come from the man who created the global RED charity with his friend the rock star Bono. Oh, Mr. Shriver. Are we now to believe you were never into rock and roll, that all along you had us fooled, and were actually an opera buff?

There\u2019s also a 1,400-square-foot guesthouse with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and an \u201centertaining\u201d kitchen, as well as an additional one-bathroom, one-bathroom cottage.\u000a\u000aOutside, there are \u201cpark-like\u201d grounds, with lots of trees, gardens and lawns, as well as a blue stone patio with a pergola and a gunite pool. The property is located in the hamlet of Tuckahoe, and it\u2019s in between the Southampton Golf Club and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club.\u000a\u000aRay and Cusimano decided it\u2019s time to sell the abode, which is on the market for $4.9 million, because they\u2019ve now built a custom home upstate, which is on over 200 acres near Lake Luzerne.\u000a\u000aRay isn\u2019t the only Food Network celebrity chef making real estate moves in the Hamptons this year, though. Indeed, Katie Lee is also ready to part ways with her Hamptons home\u2014she listed her Water Mill estate for $5.5 million in July.

aVIn just three years, Outdoor Voices has become the cool girl athleisure brand of choice.

aVSeattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field drew a somewhat different crowd than the usual Seahawks fan-base this past weekend. From Thursday through Sunday the sporting venue played host to the third annual Seattle Art Fair, where international collectors and art enthusiasts perused the offerings of 100 galleries from ten different countries, listened to musical performances and sipped champagne.\u000a\u000aOutside the field, the only indication that a major cultural event was happening next door was an elegant sculpture by Jessica Jackson Hutchins. In the work, a decommissioned bus station stands on a plinth, its windows and ceiling replaced by colorful stained glass. A thin green hammock hangs in the middle like a smile. The entire structure gazes at the stairs leading up to the 72,000-person stadium, a relative Goliath. Built with a $360 million budget, much from local Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, the stadium is simultaneously a mass entertainment center\u2014where the Seahawks play and Metallica will perform this weekend\u2014and a symbol of the city\u2019s wealth. A single piece of art, and the individual who created it, can seem very small in comparison.\u000a\u000aSame goes at an art fair. At an event designed to connect dealers and collectors, artists often have little place. As other major art fairs have done in an attempt to add a less commercial, more creative element to the festivities, the Seattle Art Fair (which Allen himself founded) has employed a curator to organize public programming. For the past two years, Los Angeles-based Laura Fried has acted as its Artistic Director.\u000a\u000aThis year, her subversive selections included a performance by artist Ellen Lesperance that featured women dressed as witches wandering fair aisles critiquing late-stage capitalism, and a performance by artists Dylan Mira and Erika Vogt that involved the latter walking around sculptural installations in the city\u2019s Union Station, uttering phrases condemning orientalism.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m all for projects that exist in the interstitial spaces of an art fair,\u201d Fried told me in the VIP lounge. \u201cI think it mediates your experience in a meaningful way. I know that I have that experience at an art fair, seeing thousands of objects.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, it was difficult to walk around the fair without encountering one of seven projects situated at the fair\u2019s intersections. Naama Tsabar\u2019s piece, Closer, was a particular audience favorite. Five times throughout the weekend, the musician who goes by the moniker Fielded interacted with Tsabar\u2019s sculpture, a tall white wood and metal box that contained microphones and guitar strings. Fielded reached into the box to play the internal instrument, singing into the embedded microphone. Guests were treated to mini concerts, and Fielded\u2019s haunting voice reverberated throughout the aisles.\u000a\u000aFried also focused on bringing West Coast voices to the fair. She says she wanted to \u201cbridge what\u2019s happening [in Seattle] and what I\u2019ve experienced down the coast.\u201d Lesperance and Hutchins are both based in Portland, while Mira and Vogt hail from Los Angeles. Brennan Gerard and Ryan Kelly, who premiered their gorgeous, provocative film Modern Living, spend half their time in Los Angeles, and their work features performances by L.A. Dance Project. Artist Mary Ann Peters represented Seattle with a large-scale sculpture. On Saturday, artists Oscar Tuazon and Jennifer West spoke about their work in the fair\u2019s adjunct theater. The former grew up in Seattle, while the latter spent years in the city as a teenager. Both now, however, live in Los Angeles.\u000a\u000aIf Fried did her part to support local artists and enliven the Seattle\u2019s cultural scene\u2014beyond art sales\u2014the city\u2019s gallerists attempted to attract interest and engagement from the rapidly expanding tech community. According to John Braseth of Seattle\u2019s oldest major fine art gallery, Woodside / Braseth, it\u2019s a long process. He explains, \u201cIt\u2019s a question of building relationships\u2026you have to educate first.\u201d Even if someone makes stock options, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to do anything but buy a Tesla.\u201d Braseth describes how these companies\u2019 internal art programs are also helping spur interest in culture.\u000a\u000aOver at the booth for Laguna Beach-based Peter Blake Gallery, Blake revealed that he hadn\u2019t sold anything at the fair as of Saturday afternoon. His booth was filled with minimal works by members of the Light and Space movement\u2014a thoroughly West Coast enterprise. Nevertheless, he told me he\u2019d return next year. He\u2019d found the fairgoers friendly and open-minded. As an outsider, he assessed that the city, in particular its community of recent Bay Area transplants, was hungry for culture and reluctant to fall behind San Francisco. While we were speaking a man in pink shorts with a Frieze Art Fair tote joined the conversation. He revealed that, indeed, he\u2019d recently moved to the city from California to work for Microsoft. Behind us, an ethereal painting by Mary Corse shimmered.\u000a\u000aPaul Becker, Founder and CEO of art buying platform Art Money believes that the tech set may yet find an even deeper connection to the art world. \u201cI think people who are into tech are essentially creatively interested people,\u201d he said outside his booth at the fair. \u201cIt\u2019s about discovery, it\u2019s about doing things better, it\u2019s about creative thinking and innovative thinking and I think contemporary art brings all of that. So I think there\u2019s a really natural synergy.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether all this supports art-making and opportunity for the city\u2019s creative practitioners remains to be seen. But for one weekend, a center built by a tech fortune drew in the Seattle community\u2014from long-time collectors to the young, tattooed masses. The fair was a welcome and unpretentious respite from its counterparts in New York, boding well for future connection between the city\u2019s contrasting factions.

aVOn Thursday evening, at the end of the first day of the Seattle Art Fair, I went on a witch hunt. Ten women wearing black hooded cloaks were wandering the aisles. Amid booths housing galleries from around the world, the dark figures walked, carrying battle axes, reading poetry, playing music and taking pictures on their phones. It was the VIP preview; they were dodging trays of passed hors d\u2019oeuvres and caterers holding empty champagne flutes, too.\u000a\u000aI followed one with red shoes. The word \u201cWITCH\u201d was emblazoned on the back of her cloak in white lettering. She stopped to speak with a small group inside a booth. After she finished, I caught her attention. She told me her name was Sandra Percival, and she directed a Portland art space called Zena Zezza. She described her actions at the fair: \u201cI picked one gallery to stand outside the door in front of. It made me feel like I had some kind of resistance, some kind of performative relationship with the place that I was standing.\u201d Percival referenced the Dana Schutz controversy at the Whitney and the way that a protestor had blocked the work from viewers\u2019 sight as a political act. She was similarly choosing to stand in spots at the fair she felt deserved solemn, serious attention.\u000a\u000aPercival and her cohort were part of a large performance piece by Ellen Lesperance, a Portland-based artist, which was commissioned by the fair. Separate iterations will occur throughout the weekend. Most participants had discovered the project through an open call. The work, titled W.I.T.C.H. 1985, arose from Lesperance\u2019s ongoing investigations into the work of feminist activist groups like W.I.T.C.H. (Women\u2019s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell), which has operated in different worldwide covens since the 1960s. After the performance ended, I asked Lesperance how she\u2019d discovered them.\u000a\u000a\u201cA contingent of W.I.T.C.H. is really active in Portland right now, which is where I live,\u201d she revealed. \u201cAfter the Trump win I think a lot of W.I.T.C.H. covens kind of re-arose, and that\u2019s been the way that they\u2019ve functioned since the 60s.\u201d A glimpse at the Instagram account (@witchpdx) for Lesperance\u2019s local chapter reveals that they recently threw a \u201cHex the Patriarchy\u201d party and donated proceeds to nearby LGBTQ groups. They have also published \u201cspells, essays, art & manifestos\u201d in their W.I.T.C.H.PDX: Witchcraft in Late Stage Capitalism zine, and participated (fully cloaked with their faces covered) in Portland\u2019s marches supporting women and science.\u000a\u000aLesperance isn\u2019t interested in joining the group, though, and her interest expands beyond her hometown roots. During her research, she became intrigued by the garments that the women at the Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp in Berkshire, England wore. For almost two decades, up until 2000, the residents regularly conducted protests against nuclear weaponry out front of the nearby Royal Air Force Base. Lesperance watched footage of an action at the camp and saw that one of the activists was wearing clothing adorned with an insignia that said \u201cwitch.\u201d She\u2019s not sure whether a W.I.T.C.H. sect migrated from the States to the United Kingdom, or whether the women donned clothing that read \u201cwitch\u201d for some other reason. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in following women\u2019s histories that people don\u2019t necessarily know about,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aApparently, no one\u2019s documented all the W.I.T.C.H. sects that have arisen throughout the past five decades. \u201cThere\u2019s a bridge to be made between now and then,\u201d says Lesperance. \u201cThere are people that I\u2019ve been in contact with, [that were] like \u2018oh yeah we had a sect in Texas in the 80s\u2019 and other people that were like, \u2018I\u2019ve seen people doing this in Italy in the 70s.\u2019\u201d Like many women\u2019s stories, these remain buried.\u000a\u000aAt the fair, Lesperance is also showing work at the booth of Portland gallery Adams and Ollman. Two framed works on paper display sweater patterns related to garments that women wore at Greenham Common. \u201cBecause a lot of them were outside a lot of time, and they weren\u2019t allowed permanent structures to live in, knitting really became part of what they did to stay warm. Knitting ideological messages in their sweaters was a thing there,\u201d she says. By designing new cloaks for the performance (Portland-based designer Jason Rens fabricated them, and Lesperance added her own beadwork), she preserves the idea that roles traditionally assumed by women\u2014like knitting and making clothing\u2014can result in powerful political statements.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked her about her piece\u2019s antagonistic relationship with many of the forces that govern an art fair, Lesperance offered an anecdote. \u201cA man came up to me afterwards and told me that having it be an anti-capitalist critique, it wasn\u2019t an appropriate venue for it. It\u2019s just like, \u2018you saying this to me is exactly\u2026\u2019\u201d she trailed off here, exasperated.\u000a\u000aElsewhere in the fair, another witch, a Seattle-based performance artist named Marchette Dubois played improvised music on small instruments near a large installation. She described her own motivations for participating. \u201cWhat can we do that would sort-of bring that spirit of the feminist anti-war collective and put it in the space, and what do I have to offer?\u201d she asked. \u201cI also didn\u2019t have any projects this weekend and it seemed like a really weird and fun thing to do.\u201d

aVDemocratic leadership has made several missteps in their efforts to woo voters that left en masse during the Obama administration. They have suppressed and undermined every opportunity for reform since Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss. In the DNC chair election, an establishment-backed candidate, Tom Perez, used backroom tactics to stop a Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter, Congressman Keith Ellison, from winning the position. Islamophobic smears were used to discredit Ellison, and later reports revealed that DNC members were threatened so that they would fall in line behind Perez. Similar tactics were used in Florida Democratic Party chair and California Democratic Party chair races.\u000a\u000aDespite a class action lawsuit pending in court against the DNC and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democratic leadership has continued to support Wasserman Schultz. Their support for her is now backfiring: She is at the center of a controversy surrounding her former IT staffer, Imran Awan, who she continued to employ up until his recent arrest for bank fraud. In regards to the class action lawsuit, DNC attorneys said in court that the organization has the right to rig primaries if they so choose. Regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s final outcome, the federal judge\u2019s decision and explanation will likely embarrass the party and expose its role in disenfranchising millions of voters to get Hillary Clinton elected.\u000a\u000aIn September 2017, the trial for Sen. Bob Menendez will begin over bribery charges he was indicted for in 2015. The Democratic Party will likely try to pretend that the trial doesn\u2019t exist, as it has with the DNC lawsuit and the investigation into Wasserman Schultz\u2019s IT staffer. In the fall, Hillary Clinton and former DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile are releasing their memoirs of the 2016 elections, which will likely broaden the rift between establishment Democrats and progressives. Democratic Party consultant Sally Albright recently tweeted about Clinton\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cSomeone on Hardball just said Hillary goes NUCLEAR on Bernie Sanders in her book.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat Russia interfered in the election has been one of the most perversive narratives pushed by Democratic leadership. Several Democrats, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Congressman Adam Schiff and Congressman Ted Lieu, have built large followings by centering their messaging on Russia and Trump. But if the Trump-Russia investigation doesn\u2019t live up to the hype, voters may feel mislead, leading Democrats to suffer in 2018. On August 5, Politico reported that some Democrats are starting to fear repercussions from focusing too much on Russia. \u201cWe need to talk about what people think about when they wake up in the morning, and it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Democratic strategist Darry Sragow told Politico. \u201cThe more we talk about stuff that voters don\u2019t truly care about in their daily lives\u2026it confirms that the Democratic Party\u2019s brain has been eaten by the elites in Washington who have been sitting fat and happy for a lot of years while working Americans have lost their jobs and lost confidence in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome tactics that Democrats have used to elevate the Russia narrative, such as propping up conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch and constantly fetishizing about impeaching Trump, are frankly embarrassing. As the investigation progresses, each new development is treated as a smoking gun. In regards to the recent news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued a grand jury subpoena\u2014which is normally done in secret as it was during the Clinton email server investigation\u2014incited speculation that Mueller found evidence of criminal activity. The 2018 World Cup is being held in Russia just a few months before the midterm elections. Because of this, even more attention will be put on Russia, which will likely result in the most unhinged purveyors of the Russian election interference narrative taking center stage\u2014to the Democratic Party\u2019s detriment.\u000a\u000aOver the past few months, several Democrats have hinted that they will run for president in 2020, and Congressman John Delaney became the first to formally announce his bid for the presidency. Establishment Democrats are already working overtime to shut down criticism of their preferred candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Conflating policy criticism with disparaging progressives instead of engaging in tactical and beneficial discussions devolves critical thinking and hampers the party\u2019s ability to recover. The tactic of coercing voters to fall in line behind candidates that don\u2019t inspire excitement is embodied by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s new slogan, \u201cHave you seen the other guys?\u201d Democrats are doubling down on their tactic of focusing on how bad Trump is, even though it proved a dismal failure in 2016.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s rising disapproval rating hasn\u2019t led to a surge in popularity for the Democratic Party, and the perception that it will is dangerous. The Democrats\u2019 Better Deal agenda provided some refreshing ideas, but overall it fails to address the forces that enabled Trump\u2019s rise. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reduced the agenda to a \u201cpresentation\u201d rather than a change in the party\u2019s direction. The DCCC incited severe criticism among its base when its chair, Ben Ray Lujan, announced that abortion rights would not be a litmus test for Democratic candidates in upcoming elections. Many took this move as confirmation that Democrats are moving toward the center.\u000a\u000aOn August 3, The New York Times reported that West Virginia Governor Jim Justice switched parties from being a Democrat, a shift Sen. Joe Manchin has also signaled he might make as he begins to court Trump supporters. In order to recoup its losses, the Democratic party must enact drastic reforms. Instead, party leaders act as though their losses will naturally fix themselves with the help of a few minor adjustments. In doing so, they set themselves up for more embarrassment and failure.

aV\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile most of us were busy basking in the final weeks of summer sun, the art world decamped to Colorado for a rollicking weekend of celebration to benefit the Aspen Art Museum. The annual ArtCrush gala, now in its 13th year, unfolded on Friday night at the base of the Aspen mountains, and kicked-off with a silent auction and cocktail hour during which a mass of art patrons from around the world placed their bids on works by the likes of Marilyn Minter, Raymond Pettibon and Daniel Arsham.\u000a\u000aThe cocktail hour also became a runway show of sorts for guests to show off their appetite for luxury garments. The hour included Sarah Arison, Eleanore De Sole, Jamie Tisch and Carrie Wells, a local real estate broker, whose tiered chiffon dress by Roberto Cavalli turned heads thanks to its striking resemblance to the infamous yellow gown worn by Beyoncé in her \u201cLemonade\u201d music video. \u201cI bought it for a wedding in the Amalfi coast,\u201d she explained to us as we sat for dinner. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s the Beyoncé dress, but mine is a little different.\u201d\u000a\u000aDinner gave way to the always-anticipated live auction of ten coveted works led by Sotheby\u2019s auctioneer Oliver Barker, who remarked that the ArtCrush auction is always \u201cmore exciting than a Sean Spicer press conference.\u201d Among the masterpieces on the block was EVERY WHICH WAY + UP, created by the gala\u2019s honoree and recipient of the Aspen Art Award, Lawrence Weiner, who called upon the room full of 600 supporters to focus their efforts on public works. \u201cThe whole point of art is about making it public,\u201d Weiner said before his lot sold for an evening high of $450,0000. \u201cWhen art is not seen, it doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe night closed as a fleet of Audi Q7s shuttled guests to an after-party held at local hotspot BellyUp, where revelers cut a rug in honor of the $2.8 million raised for the Aspen Art Museum. \u201cI think the people make the party,\u201d event chair Amy Phelan told us before heading to the dance floor. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing community with terrific people from everywhere in the world. We\u2019ve got great artists, great wine, and an amazing museum, so we\u2019re all lucky to be here.\u201d

aVAziz Ansari has done some pretty great standup specials, but he makes my cringe muscles ache when no one has bought tickets to hear him talk.\u000a\u000aHe attained a new level of insufferability with his GQ cover story in which\u2014when he isn\u2019t faux-regretfully reminding readers of how wealthy he\u2019s become\u2014he pats himself on the back incessantly for not carrying the internet around on his phone any longer.*\u000a\u000a\u201cI wanted to stop that thing where I get home and look at websites for an hour and a half, checking to see if there\u2019s a new thing.

I\u2019ve been doing it for a couple months, and it\u2019s worked,\u201d Ansari tells Mark Anthony Green, the magazine\u2019s style reporter.\u000a\u000aThe story is anchored by the success of Ansari\u2019s second season of Master of None on Netflix. It comes with a video where he shows viewers what he carries in his travel backpack, in which we learn that he still shoots photos on film (which is very precious). At the end there\u2019s a non sequitur where he tells viewers that they should put a piece of software on their computer that only lets them use the internet for a half hour to an hour each day. That\u2019s it.\u000a\u000aPlease ignore this advice.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no shortage of hand-wringing stories out there about the internet shrinking attention spans. While we\u2019re on the subject, it also gets blamed for leaving us lonelier. It\u2019s a convenient explanation. For anyone over 20, the internet has become markedly more important over the course of our lives. In 2007, I remember having drinks with someone who said he wished there was a way to Google a question at any time.\u000a\u000aWelcome to the future!\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s made the internet and the mobile web the globe\u2019s most convenient straw man. If we\u2019ve all watched connectivity become more and more important and we feel sad, unfocused or disappointed, then maybe the fault lies with the web. Not us! Something did this to us.\u000a\u000aAnsari\u2019s digital disconnection is an example of a wealthy person weaving an eccentricity into a virtue where there is none\u000a\u000aAnsari buys it. He has given up carrying the internet around with him and that\u2019s made it possible for him to read books again, he tells GQ. This echoes a frequent lament heard in complaints simmering in the constant dissatisfaction with the mobile web (at least within my filter bubble): people say that they haven\u2019t been able to read books ever since the internet got into their pocket.\u000a\u000aMaybe. I don\u2019t buy it.\u000a\u000aYoung people seem to like books pretty well. The e-book market is consistently growing. There could be more reading than ever, but there\u2019s just so many more ways to read now. And as long as we\u2019re making arguments from anecdote, I sit on the internet all day long, and I also read a lot of books. I know a lot of people who do the same.\u000a\u000aMaybe the folks who say they can\u2019t read books anymore just don\u2019t actually want to read them? In fact, maybe they would like to be someone who reads books, but they really aren\u2019t. Here, the internet presents itself as a convenient excuse, one that other people who also wish they wanted to read books (but don\u2019t) will readily agree with. Yes, it\u2019s not our fault we don\u2019t read. It\u2019s Zuckerberg\u2019s.\u000a\u000aWhat makes Ansari\u2019s admonitions especially grating, though, are the ways in which he never quite acknowledges how his advantages make it possible for him to unplug in ways most of us can\u2019t.\u000a\u000aFirst, Ansari tells Green that he\u2019s barely consuming news any more. Green challenges him by saying he\u2019s opting for ignorance. Ansari counters by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not choosing ignorance. I\u2019m choosing to not watch wrestling.\u201d It\u2019s worth reminding readers here that there\u2019s always a plausible sounding string of words that can be strung together to justify any misguided behavior. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that this is basically the same logic as that employed by right wingers who brag about the fact that they don\u2019t consume the \u201clamestream media.\u201d\u000a\u000aLook how that\u2019s turned out. Follow the news, okay?\u000a\u000aBut the most important point is this: Ansari can afford to be ignorant. There\u2019s almost no political development whose consequences Ansari couldn\u2019t afford to escape. So why should he care if environmental regulations are slashed, health insurers can easily deny coverage again or large banks cook up a new bubble? Ansari\u2019s stardom and his bursting bank accounts will be welcome anywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aWhich brings us to the second point: Ansari is also comfortably unemployed right now. He never needs to work again,** especially if he decided to tone down his jet-setting lifestyle. The larger theme of the the GQ interview concerns the fact that Ansari doesn\u2019t really know what he\u2019s doing next and he\u2019s in no rush to find it. Must be nice.\u000a\u000aBut as I was writing this piece, one of my co-workers asked an editor to reply to an email from the train. That\u2019s something that those of us with jobs do. Now that we can be connected, we have to be. Some of us do it more or less. Some of us are good at unplugging appropriately, such as while hiking or hanging at the beach. But no one with responsibilities completely checks out. We just can\u2019t. That\u2019s not how the world works anymore.\u000a\u000aAnd if we waste time on our phones, what of it? Yes, we idly click and scroll and swipe when we\u2019ve nothing else to do, but once upon a time, we read vapid magazines, completed crossword puzzles and doodled. I\u2019m not convinced these differences are so important so much as there are far more options for idle distraction.\u000a\u000aBesides unfocused people, there have also always been terminally single people who have longed for an explanation that exonerated their deficiencies. In science, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cconfirmation bias.\u201d It\u2019s the idea that investigators will look for results or design experiments in such a way that confirm their hypothesis. It\u2019s hard to imagine someone setting out to study the internet\u2019s effect on attention span or community who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s had one.\u000a\u000aAnsari\u2019s digital disconnection is an example of a wealthy person weaving an eccentricity into a virtue where there is none. Readers shouldn\u2019t feel bad when they can\u2019t live up to his pointless example.\u000a\u000aTen years from now, there will be new explanations for distractedness and loneliness and the internet and mobile web will have faded into the background of our lives as the telephone, the newspaper and the postal system did before them.\u000a\u000aAnd I still won\u2019t care whether Aziz Ansari has plugged in or not, and you shouldn\u2019t either.\u000a\u000a____________________\u000a\u000a* Weirdly, for a magazine that\u2019s so fetishistic about products and prices, the interview never explains how it is he\u2019s doing this. It would take a special build from a device maker to make a smart phone that doesn\u2019t have browsers and other internet enabled apps, though why would you have a smart phone if you just wanted voice and text? So is he just using a flip phone or a stick phone? Or did Tim Cook make him a special low-feature iPhone? GQ never tells us.\u000a\u000a** In another video he describes all the vintage Rolexes he\u2019s bought friends and family members, saying, \u201cI hope this story doesn\u2019t make me sound like a dick that just has so much money to buy vintage Rolexes.\u201d IDK Aziz, how do you think it sounds?

aVAlan Rickman, who generated plenty of goose-pimples in his all-too-brief career, once confessed his scariest moment occurred when auditioning for Judge Turpin in the Sweeney Todd film: \u201cStephen Sondheim walked into the room and said, \u2018Sing.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s good to report that Jake Gyllenhaal, who just made his Broadway musical debut in Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, was spared this special terror even hardcore career singers know to dread. For that, he can thank Jeanine Tesori.\u000a\u000aThe Tony-winning composer of Fun Home, in her capacity as Artistic Director of Encores! Off-Center (New York City Center\u2019s series of four-day Off-Broadway revivals), hired him twice for his heretofore unknown musical gifts: first, suddenly, as Seymour in Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman\u2019s Little Shop of Horrors and then as Georges Seurat, painting his famed \u201cSunday on La Grande Jatte\u201d in Sunday et cetera.\u000a\u000a\u201cJeanine and I went through the music, and I felt she was\u2014without letting me know\u2014testing me in the process,\u201d recalled Gyllenhaal. \u201cMaybe they were a bit sneaky. They made it seem like I didn\u2019t have to, but I must have been auditioning.\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal\u2019s suspicions are correct: \u201cSteve just said, \u2018Can he sing it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes. Absolutely!\u2019 And that was it,\u201d Tesori relayed. Not so fortunate was Gyllenhaal\u2019s leading lady, Annaleigh Ashford, who plays Seurat\u2019s mistress and muse, Dot.\u000a\u000aShe\u2019s the proven musical-comedy talent (with a Tony nomination for Kinky Boots and a Tony win for You Can\u2019t Take It With You), but she had to sing for Sondheim.\u000a\u000aWhen the offer came, she was eight months pregnant (which, actually, would have worked for Dot) and in L.A. \u201cI had to make a recording for him so that he knew that I could sing the low notes in the opening number because it\u2019s quite low for a lady voice,\u201d remembered Ashford. \u201cThat was a magical moment for me. I was in my underwear, recording it on my computer on GarageBand, and I gave him extra scales to show him how high I went up. Then, I sent that little mp3 off, and here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aTesori suspected a musical career might be lurking in Gyllenhaal when she heard he did musicals in high school. That, plus the fact that they shared the same agent, cinched the deal. \u201cWhen I was putting Little Shop together, I asked our agent if Jake would do it. He said, \u2018He might. Let me ask him.\u2019\u201d The actor was interested enough to have lunch with Tesori and discuss the possibilities. \u201cHe was doing Constellations at the time, and I started pestering him. But it wasn\u2019t until I went backstage and left him a plant that had little legs and hands on it\u2013with ketchup\u2014that he said \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal and Ashford, basking in the extra rehearsal, turn in assured, risk-taking portrayals. \u201cAs intimidating as his music is, it\u2019s also incredibly enveloping,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as you feel it in the audience, you feel it doing it as a performer. You feel safe.\u201d\u000a\u000aLa La Land musicals being all the rage now, the two leads were asked what film musicals they\u2019d like to do. Ashford paused a thoughtful beat and declared \u201cThis!\u201d\u000a\u000aThen, on further reflection, she amended that from Sunday to any given Sondheim: \u201cHis body of work is so special it\u2019s almost indelible in the lexicon of art. We should try to explore his pieces on film. It\u2019s important his work be celebrated on screen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat particular question has never come up before for Gyllenhaal, being so new to musicals. \u201cI\u2019m asked that a lot about roles in general,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe way this thing came together was serendipitous in an unlikely combination of elements\u2014almost like fate impeding and pushing in the way that it needed to be expressed. That\u2019s generally how I look at [roles] at this point. I\u2019ve never been someone who said, \u2018I want to do that,\u2019 though at some point I guess Tevye might be a good idea.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, how close does Seurat come to other characters that Gyllenhaal has played? \u201cThere\u2019s an obsessive quality to him, a focused quality that connects to a lot of characters I relate to and have played. One way or another, they\u2019ve all been leading to George, so I\u2018d probably say, really, all of them\u2014even The Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aSondheim and his director-book writer, James Lapine, drew a soaring celebration of the creative spirit from the two years Seurat spent turning chaos into coherence and disharmony into harmony for his masterpiece. As such, it seems the perfect vehicle to return the Hudson Theater to theatrical life after a half-century of other venues.\u000a\u000aGingerly tending the transfer of a book-in-hand City Center concert to a full-on, affecting Broadway production is Lapine\u2019s niece, Sama\u2013and that\u2019s not the naked nepotism it might seem. In fact, she said, \u201cIt was very cool the way it came about at City Center, really a kind of collaborative discovery between James and Jeanine.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen it became clear that the original director would not be free to repeat the chore\u2014he was busy reviving Falsettos on Broadway the same week Sunday was slated for City Center\u2014Tesori suggested getting a young up-and-coming director to do it, perhaps even a female one, and started feeding Lapine resumes to that effect.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, suddenly, he said, \u2018Oh, wait a minute, I know a fabulous young woman director, and she has already done the show!\u2019 So he called me, and we got together.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer previous Sunday had been a regional production in Columbus, Ohio. She also did a Sondheim concert with the Boston Pops in which she got to stage the painting with only six actors. \u201cIt taught me a lot about the minimalist take on such productions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d appears to be thrilled with not only the show\u2019s return but his niece\u2019s handiwork as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it without his love and support, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aRashly, before the generally rhapsodic reviews came out, the producers voluntarily withdrew the show from Tony Awards consideration so they wouldn\u2019t have to dole out 1,600 comps to voters\u2014a perilous proposition for such a short (ten-week) run.\u000a\u000aThat leaves Gyllenhaal and Ashford clinging to the \u201cIt\u2019s the work, not the reward\u201d maxim for dear life, but both can make it through without that shiny piece of silver.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a line in the show: \u2018the art of making art,\u2019\u201d Ashford pointed out. \u201cWhen I walk in the door every day, I think, \u2018We really are here for \u2018the art of making art.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal, likewise, high-roaded it: \u201cI think the performers on Broadway who have long runs work so hard for a long period of time after all the fanfare and all the excitement has passed. That\u2019s a big part of the win, in my opinion, or the nomination of a Tony. We\u2019re doing a lot of hard work right now, but our run is only ten weeks, and that is just a fact. We all know, too, that, as much as it\u2019s an honor and a history, it\u2019s also a business, and I think that business and these awards are also about getting attention and making sure that people see . . . these extraordinary shows that are on Broadway now. The most important thing for us is to get people here to see the show . . . and to make sure people keep coming back to Broadway, so there\u2019s no reason to usurp any of that. We should all be a community supporting each other.\u201d

aVIf we can all collectively root for an aunt and nephew to get together on Game of Thrones, than distant cousins shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u000a\u000aOn a previous episode of PBS\u2019 Finding Your Roots, it was revealed that actress Kyra Sedgwick and her husband Kevin Bacon are actually cousins, though the two are separated by a wide margin, according to TheWrap. On Sunday, Sedgwick was at the Television Critics Association\u2019s summer press tour to promote her new ABC Drama Ten Days in the Valley where she didn\u2019t seem to phased by the revelation.\u000a\u000a\u201cI figured I was going to be related to Kevin Bacon \u2014 I mean, most white people are related, ultimately,\u201d Sedgwick joked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised, honestly. Frankly, I figured that was part the reason that they wanted to do both of us. I had to act surprised.\u201d\u000a\u000aBacon and Sedgwick married in 1988 and have two children together.

aVAngama Mara is one of the most luxurious safari lodges in Kenya. Scroll through to see inside the lavish spot.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs you may have heard, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are currently on a trip to Africa, to celebrate the Suits actress\u2019s 36th birthday. The couple is reportedly in Botswana, and of course there are rumors that the prince will propose to his girlfriend while there.\u000a\u000aIt would be rather fitting, as his brother, Prince William, proposed to Kate Middleton while in Africa, when the two were vacationing in Kenya.\u000a\u000aIndeed, luxe African safaris are definitely having a moment right now, especially for romantic honeymoons and retreats. If you need some inspiration, look no further than Angama Mara, in Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara. It was recently named the number one \u201cTop Outdoor Adventure Hotel\u201d by AFAR Magazine\u2014it\u2019s where Julianne Hough went on her recent honeymoon, and the luxury safari lodge is also where many of the scenes in Out of Africa were filmed, including the iconic picnic scene.\u000a\u000a\U0001f418\U0001f33e #safari #masaimara #honeymoon A post shared by Julianne Hough (@juleshough) on Jul 28, 2017 at 6:16am PDT\u000a\u000aAngama Mara opened just two years ago. It\u2019s composed of two separate camps of just 15 tents each, on the edge of the Great Rift Valley. The tents, however, are definitely not what you slept in during summer camp. The lavish accommodations have 30-foot-wide floor-to-ceiling glass fronts, from which you can take in the sunrises and sunsets, as well as parquet floors, decks for in-room dining, sleek vanities with double basins, writing desks, woven screens and even a butler\u2019s lobby, for the delivery of tea, coffee and the like.\u000a\u000aAnd if you\u2019re just not able to totally separate yourself from technology (or just really want to Instagram some scenic sunset photos, for which we don\u2019t blame you), there\u2019s wifi and plenty of charging and tablet options.\u000a\u000aWhen you\u2019re not in your tent, there\u2019s the guest area, a glass space with decks, eating, dining and sitting areas. In the Pavilion there\u2019s a fitness center, infinity swimming pool and a safari shop, where you can buy Kenyan clothing and jewelry. There is also a library, as well as spaces to get spa treatments. There is also a curated gallery of African art, as well as a craft studio.\u000a\u000aThe game viewing in the Mara Triangle is definitely one of the highlights of the lodge; you can see the annual Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest and zebras enter the reserve. You also see lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and other animals.\u000a\u000aAnother gorgeous morning flying about the trees #balloonsafari @governorscampcollection #Reposting @carla01j A post shared by Angama (@angamasafari) on Jul 14, 2017 at 10:28am PDT\u000a\u000aDuring high season, a stay the lodge will cost you $1,500 per night (per guest).\u000a\u000aAnd of course, the safari lodge makes sure to cater to the many honeymooners who venture there\u2014they offer massages in the private balconies of the suites, but it\u2019s the Out of Africa-esque picnic experience that is surely the favorite. Guests are escorted up the hill by a Maasai naturalist, where they partake in a lavish picnic complete with checkered blankets, cushions, chairs and a serious food spread, as well as wine.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Prince Harry and Markle will make the trip over to Kenya, after they enjoy Botswana, of course. It does seem like a lovely place to celebrate an engagement.

aVDozens of states across the country, in addition to Canada and Europe, are experiencing record wildfires in 2017. Climate change has increased the number of wildfires, their longevity and the length of the wildfire season. Global increases in temperature during the spring and summer are causing dry areas to become even drier and snow to melt earlier, leading to drought and conditions ripe for wildfires.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Forest Service has reported that 5.6 million acres of land have burned so far in the U.S. in 2017, which is 1.8 million acres over the 10 year average at the same time of year. In Florida, wildfires across the state have surpassed the five year average of acres burned from wildfires. Record high temperatures have fueled wildfires across the Western United States. Nevada reported its worst wildfire season in 15 years. Montana has also experienced one of its worst wildfire seasons ever this year, and the state is running out of funds to fight them.\u000a\u000aBetween January and May 2017, there were 57,585 wildfires in the U.S.\u2014the most in that timespan since 2000. Those fires burned 2.763 million acres of land in the U.S., which is the second highest amount on record for that period of time.\u000a\u000aIn Canada, British Columbia has declared 2017 to be its second worst wildfire year on record. The BC Wildfire has spent $204 million fighting wildfires in nearly 5,000 square kilometers. Smoke from these fires have made the state of Washington\u2019s air quality the worst in the United States.\u000a\u000aEven in cases where wildfires are caused by humans, their expansion is facilitated by environmental conditions caused by climate change: Higher temperatures throughout the year cause extremely dry conditions in which wildfires spread faster and become much more difficult to contain. In states like California, wet winters boost plant growth, creating more fuel for wildfires, which are facilitated by increasingly high summer temperatures. In this way, opposing extreme weather conditions exacerbated by climate change contribute to surges in wildfires.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists, \u201cWildfires in the Western United States have been increasing in frequency and duration since the mid-1980s, occurring nearly four times more often, burning more than six times the land area, and lasting almost five times as long (comparisons are between 1970-1986 and 1986-2003).\u201d With more than 10 million acres burned, 2015 was worst wildfire season on record in the United States.\u000a\u000aDespite this troubling trend, the Trump administration has proposed slashing the budget of climate centers that provide necessary data and information to anticipate potential wildfires. Popular Science reports, \u201cFunding for the nation\u2019s six Regional Climate Centers (RCCs), which provide data that we use to help control and prevent wildfires, is on the chopping block. The president\u2019s proposed budget would slash the Centers\u2019 budgets by 82 percent, from $3.65 million to $650,000.\u201d Trump has also proposed drastic cuts to the U.S. Forest Service in his 2018 budget, with a $300 million reduction in wildfire fighting programs, a $50 million cut to wildfire prevention efforts, and a 23 percent cut in budgets to volunteer firefighter departments. Trump is threatening to destroy vital resources that thousands of Americans rely on to prevent and control wildfires in the United States.

aVPhotographer William Eggleston\u2019s Damien Hirst-like single artist sale made $5.9 million at Christie\u2019s New York yesterday, trouncing the $2.7 million estimate reported in The New York Times earlier this year, with every single one of the 36 lots on offer selling. That 100 percent sell-through rate is known in auction parlance as a white glove sale.\u000a\u000aSome of the works on offers were enlarged versions (measuring 44 by 60 inches) of the photographer\u2019s most iconic images from the 1970s and \u201980s, and were being sold to benefit the Eggleston Artistic Trust, which aims to preserve the 72-year-old artist\u2019s artistic legacy. Others came from negatives that he shot during those decades and never produced.\u000a\u000aTop-lot honors went to Mr. Eggleston\u2019s Untitled (1970), perhaps his best known image, a shot of a tiny three-wheel bicycle from a low vantage point, making it appear to loom over a single-story house in the background. It made $578,500, well above its $200,000 to $300,000 estimate, and amounted to a new record for a single print by the artist at auction.

aVFor many, American football is a beautiful game that is simple to enjoy but complex to master. Choreographed with a mixture of artistry and brutality, it features the occasional \u201cbig hit\u201d or bone-jarring tackle, forcing a fumble and turning the tide of the game.\u000a\u000aBut with this part of football comes justified concern about the long-term health effects of engaging in this type of activity over time, concerns that abound in practically every high-impact contact sport. It is possible that effects of continued involvement may accumulate quietly in the background until they show themselves, later in life.\u000a\u000aA recent study appeared to give a \u201cbig hit\u201d to the game of football itself, with findings that nearly all the brains of 111 deceased NFL players studied showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\u000a\u000aAt the University of Florida, our interdisciplinary team has studied brain injuries in athletes, military veterans and civilians for many years. Regarding sports concussion, there are many gaps in our knowledge and many associated issues to consider as we develop ways to keep our athletes, both young and old, safe.\u000a\u000aThe concussion \u2018explosion\u2019\u000a\u000aConcussions result from mechanical impact to the brain that produces transient changes in awareness or consciousness and a range of other symptoms. A 2016 study reported that between 1.1 million and 1.9 million concussions occur each year in children.\u000a\u000aAlthough diagnosed concussions have been the primary focus, they are not the only, or maybe even the main, problem. There is also rising concern about subconcussive impacts, repetitive blows that may not be severe enough to cause clinical symptoms. There may be hundreds of subconcussive impacts per player, per year.\u000a\u000aIn response to widespread concern, organized sports organizations from Pop Warner to the NCAA to professional levels have developed and implemented concussion management protocols to help in the identification and management of concussions.\u000a\u000aYet the massive attention given to concussion management and prevention has produced a level of public pseudo-awareness about CTE that currently outstrips what is scientifically known about the disorder.\u000a\u000aMissing links and gaps in knowledge\u000a\u000aSeveral scientific studies have linked repetitive brain trauma to CTE.\u000a\u000aCTE is a \u201ctauopathy\u201d in which the normally occurring protein tau becomes misfolded and accumulates at the depths of the folds (sulci) of the brain, in regions that may also be susceptible to mechanical forces during head impacts. The abnormal accumulation of the tau protein gives rise to a cascade of brain pathology that leads to cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric problems (depression, anxiety, aggression, reduced impulse control), functional decline and, eventually, death.\u000a\u000aThe study published July 25 that showed CTE in 110 of 111 deceased, former NFL players reflected a startling 99 percent prevalence rate.\u000a\u000aThe results were reported by news outlets across the world, leading many people to think that CTE is an all but inevitable outcome of playing football or other sports.\u000a\u000aBut is it? And most importantly for parents, coaches and fans, what is the actual risk to my kids, my players and my team?\u000a\u000aThe answers to these questions are not yet known, though the risk to the individual player is very likely to be considerably less than would be suggested by available research findings.\u000a\u000aTwo important facts should be considered.\u000a\u000aFirst, studies of CTE have all been conducted on small samples of brains delivered to CTE research centers by families of former players who have had concern about post-retirement cognitive, psychiatric or behavioral problems and symptoms.\u000a\u000aThe likelihood of finding brain pathology in these brains of symptomatic players is high, but these results cannot be generalized to all former football players, many of whom are living healthy lives in retirement.\u000a\u000aSecond, no study has evaluated even a single living player to determine whether he or she exhibits the cognitive, psychiatric or behavioral signs of CTE and then followed that person to autopsy to verify that CTE-associated pathology actually exists in their brains.\u000a\u000aSo, we do not know the actual prevalence of CTE in the general population of players, though it is assuredly much lower than those quoted by studies of symptomatic players.\u000a\u000aWhy do some get CTE and others do not?\u000a\u000aWe also don\u2019t know much about who develops CTE and who doesn\u2019t. There are over 10,000 living NFL retirees, yet the entire science of CTE is based on samples of less than a few hundred former NFL players and a handful of athletes from other sports. This means that some of those exposed to the risk of repetitive head impacts develop CTE, but most do not.\u000a\u000aThere are several factors that may contribute to the development of brain dysfunction and disease, including:\u000a\u000amedical or genetic risk factors\u000a\u000amedical and psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and abuse of prescription medications or other drugs and substances\u000a\u000areduced educational attainment or literacy, or socioeconomic deprivation\u000a\u000aIn addition, some athletes have poor adjustments to retirement, leading to psycho-social and psychiatric maladjustment, marital or financial difficulties, substance abuse and other behavioral problems.\u000a\u000aRepetitive head impacts may heighten risk of CTE, but other factors are undoubtedly involved in determining whether risk becomes reality. Reducing risk of CTE will involve targeting and treating these other factors as well.\u000a\u000aWhat parents, coaches and athletes need to know\u000a\u000aWe need to take seriously the possible health consequences of prolonged exposure to repetitive head impacts and concussions.\u000a\u000aThat said, parental decisions to remove children from contact sports should be weighed against the many proven positive aspects of participation in team sports. Decisions should not be based on inflated risk assessment. Several studies have shown that recreational or scholastic athletic participation in youth conveys no significant added risk to brain health later in life.\u000a\u000aStill, the developing brain may be more susceptible to injury and may take longer to recover. Knowledge of the individual player and his or her response to injury should guide parents, coaches and athletes in decision-making. Some youth are more injury-prone than others, and some have other conditions (e.g., ADHD, learning disability) that may affect how they react to head impact. When all factors are considered, the strongest predictor of recovery is the severity of initial symptoms.\u000a\u000aAll states now have legislation requiring public schools to have a concussion program in place. Parents should ask their school or athletic organization what their policies are regarding concussion management.\u000a\u000aWhile helmet manufacturers are developing helmets that might provide greater protection, there is not enough evidence to recommend one over another. We do know, however, that appropriate fitting of helmets and protective gear is necessary to get the full protective benefit.\u000a\u000aSome measures to reduce possible exposure and risk have been implemented. The Dartmouth University football program has significantly reduced contact practices for its football team. Other Ivy League teams and organizations have followed suit. The NCAA has recently recommended the elimination of two-a-day practices and restricted the number of contact practices allowed in football.\u000a\u000aPhysicians and athletic trainers at the University of Florida are using data from helmet sensors originally designed to help detect concussions to inform coaching staff on which specific practice drills and pad configurations may incur higher risk so that such drills can be adjusted.\u000a\u000aOngoing research for this important issue is focused on developing techniques for accurate diagnosis while an individual is alive and understanding the exact pathophysiology that might inform future disease-modifying treatment, in addition to our current treatments aimed at reduction of symptoms.\u000a\u000aFor those athletes who choose to continue the sports they love, we hope for continued innovations and policies that make their participation as safe as possible.\u000a\u000aRussell M.

aV\u201cI have to tell you my new favorite joke,\u201d Uzo Aduba says. \u201cI literally died laughing at it for half a day. You ready? Why did the chicken cross the road?\u201d\u000a\u000aI mumble something that probably sounds like, \u201cTo get to the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo get to the idiot\u2019s house,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cKnock knock.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chicken.\u201d And with that, Aduba descends into laughter. She insists the joke works better in print, but I\u2019ll contest it works pretty well when it\u2019s delivered by a two-time Emmy winner.\u000a\u000aAduba catapulted into mainstream recognition for her tender portrayal of Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren on Netflix\u2019s hit original series, Orange Is the New Black. In 2014, she won her first Emmy in 2014 for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. A year later, she won a second time\u2014best supporting actress in a drama\u2014making her the only actress to win awards in two different categories for the same role.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to me because I don\u2019t know if I believe we were ever one thing exclusively,\u201d Aduba says, about the Netflix show\u2019s category jumping. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the word is that needs to be created to call it, since we\u2019re so hell-bent as a society to find a category. We\u2019re very invested in placing things in certain boxes, for our own outside comfort, so we can say, \u2018I understand that you are this religion, that you are this gender, that you are this sexual orientation, that you are this sort of director, that this is this sort of show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aFrom its first season, Orange Is the New Black was a show that defied television convention. For one, it was a show that focused almost exclusively on women\u2019s stories, showcasing narratives about power and fear in a world in which male attention was an almost useless currency. It\u2019s also one of the most diverse shows on television\u2014one of the first to showcase a transgender actress portraying a transgender woman, and, as Aduba brings up, one of the only shows that depicts a variety of racial experiences across a number of different races.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs many shows are there are on television that are diverse, now, we still don\u2019t see a lot of television where we see a swath of different characters on a single show,\u201d Aduba says. There\u2019s Orange Is the New Black, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Master of None, Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, \u201cand not many more. We still haven\u2019t rounded that corner. It\u2019s not just enough to have different faces speaking for different groups but different faces all within the same group, speaking to all people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo character in Orange Is the New Black is the \u201ctoken\u201d minority: a character who pops up to offer an opinion on behalf of his or her entire race, whose main purpose in the narrative is offering guidance to the white protagonist and offering comfort to the viewers at home that they aren\u2019t racist.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are people who think this isn\u2019t for them because they\u2019re not a woman, or because they\u2019ve never been to prison, or they see people of color and think it\u2019s not for them. On the side of gender, people are realizing gender has nothing to do with it. You tell an honest story, an honest story lives inside of all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat love of storytelling was what brought Aduba from her path of becoming a classical opera singer to becoming an actress.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn high school, I knew I liked to sing, and my voice happened to sing in a classical fashion, so that seemed like the most sensible thing to do next. But when I went to school, I realized what I loved about singing was the storytelling aspect. Boston College has a classical program, so in the morning I\u2019d be rolling on the floor for movement, and we had to take acting and Shakespeare for the theatrical component, and then the afternoon we did the musical component\u2014musical theory, music history, and I was like, I think I like the rolling on the floor part more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you go into college, you\u2019re in this period in your life where you have so much certainty and uncertainty at the same time. You\u2019re so sure of some things, like, who you think you are and the person you want to be, and then going to school can either cement that for you and confirm, or, for a lot of people, I think it winds up breaking you wide open and making you realize your true identity and that\u2019s what happened with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as she shifted her career goals, Aduba\u2019s classical singing training formed the foundation of what would become her disciplined approach to the craft of acting. \u201cOpera is not something you just get up and do. It takes a discipline, a study, a vocal dexterity that is achieved through the exercise of the voice, and I think that\u2019s applicable to acting. I think how I approach my acting is not just to wake up and do it, although there are some things that can be found in just waking up and doing things, but if I\u2019m working on material, to really study it, and really get inside the head and the psychology of that individual and the world in which he or she inhabits. I had this amazing teacher in college who said, \u2018Anyone can sing pretty, but what are you trying to say?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so what has Aduba been trying to say with the character of Suzanne, who entered the series as comic relief, Piper\u2019s unrequited lover and who, over the course of four seasons, has become one of television\u2019s most heartbreakingly tragic figures, manipulated by those around her and desperate to be seen?\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody deserves love,\u201d Aduba says without hesitation.\u000a\u000aSuzanne Warren is just one of the many characters Orange Is the New Black has developed and enriched over the span of its four seasons. It\u2019s not character growth so much as character deepening, like seeing a two-dimensional shape and then walking around and realizing it was a three-dimensional sculpture all along. Through flashbacks, Orange Is the New Black peels back the khaki uniform and allows us to see prisoners\u2014so often dismissed in red-wine swirling living room political discussions as a monolith\u2014as individuals, each sheltering their own stories.\u000a\u000aAlthough its category at the Emmys has transferred from comedy to drama, that seems something of an arbitrary judgment call and not a shift in the show itself. The first season did have sad-sack Larry, Piper\u2019s infuriating milquetoast liberal stereotype of a fiancé, but it still looked unflinchingly at drug abuse, the struggles of being transgender, the cruel caprices of the corrections officers and the day-to-day Kafkaesque nightmare that is American incarceration.\u000a\u000aThe later seasons didn\u2019t have Larry (thank god), but it focused on the same issues, still unflinching, even as they brought us to their heightened, tragic breaking point.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the first season, Season 4, where I have not watched the end,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cWhen the season came out, that experience was still very emotionally alive for me and I didn\u2019t want to have that experience right then again, because I remember, very clearly, second for second, what each of those last three episodes felt like\u2014and that feeling was so visceral, still, a year and however long away from it, and I was like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to watch that. I still haven\u2019t watched it. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be ready. Or if I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most difficult aspect of watching Orange Is the New Black might be the realization that it could be any one of us behind bars, without rights and seemingly without oversight, even if you think you\u2019re the type of person who would never, ever go to prison. While that lesson might have been most obvious right away with Piper, the privileged upper-middle-class blonde who got caught up 10 years ago with a drug-smuggling lover, it\u2019s true of almost every single character in the series.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood people can make mistakes,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cSetting it a min security prison, you realize with most of these characters, how they got there was a minor infection\u2014slipped on a banana peel and did something that they happened to get caught for it and you didn\u2019t. And I think that does a great way of humanizing these characters because they\u2019re not so far out of reach for most people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Aduba, she\u2019s grateful for the chance to be a part of it, to get to tell a good, honest story. \u201cThis is a gift, to get to do what I want to do. I can still remember waiting in lines, whether it was for an audition before I was union, and having to wait outside the union line, waiting for all of the union people to audition and then they would let the union people in, to stuffing envelopes, to stuffing envelopes with headshots and writing letters with my resume and dropping them off all over this city.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd now, this city is where Aduba is putting down roots. As she came to the interview, she was just finalizing buying a house to live in with her dog, Mr. Fenway Bark. \u201cI\u2019m just really happy,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cI\u2019m like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into The Woods lyric, \u2018Excited and scared.\u2019 That\u2019s what I am.\u201d

aVIn my last column, I explained how the Trump administration is trying to distract the public from increasingly serious investigations of the president\u2019s ties with Moscow by disseminating lies\u2014particularly about Seth Rich, the murdered Democratic National Committee staffer. According to the White House, with help from its media allies such as Fox News, Rich\u2014not Russian spies\u2014was the \u201creal\u201d source of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails that were leaked last summer.\u000a\u000aThat none of this is true hasn\u2019t stopped this narrative from gaining traction among Trump supporters. The president himself allegedly had a hand in crafting the noxious lies about Seth Rich, which were broadcast by Sean Hannity, a friend of Trump\u2019s, on Fox News back in May\u2014only to be quickly recanted by the network for their transparent falsehood.\u000a\u000aHowever, close examination of the Seth Rich Active Measure (to use the proper espionage term) reveals Russia\u2019s deep involvement in this White House-backed fabrication. This sordid saga commenced on July 16, 2016, less than a week after Seth Rich was murdered by an unknown gunman late at night on the streets of our nation\u2019s capital.\u000a\u000aJust six days after the killing of the 27-year-old DNC staffer, a remarkable story appeared on a shadowy conspiracy website called Sorcha Faal, which regularly posts flagrant lies from a Russian viewpoint. Among its other 2016 \u201cscoops,\u201d Sorcha Faal spread the story that two U.S. Marine helicopters had been shot down by Turkey, killing 12 Americans\u2014which never happened but got picked up by Russia\u2019s mainstream media.\u000a\u000aIts coverage of Rich\u2019s murder was even more inventive. According to Sorcha Faal, the young man had been assassinated by a Clintonian \u201chit team,\u201d which was captured a few days later \u201cafter a running gun battle with U.S. federal police forces just blocks from the White House.\u201d In this sensational story, Rich was lured to his death by Hillary\u2019s assassins, who posed as FBI agents to gain the DNC employee\u2019s trust. As the source of the stolen emails, Rich had to be liquidated to protect the Democratic presidential nominee and her family, which, Sorcha Faal reported, has been behind numerous murders.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, there\u2019s no evidence for any of the assertions made in this report, yet Sorcha Faal claimed its source was none other than Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service or SVR! The website asserted it had seen the \u201csomber\u201d SVR secret report on the Rich murder and its shocking backstory, including that \u201cSVR \u2018electronic specialists\u2019 performing counterintelligence \u2018missions/operations\u2019 noted on 7 July an \u2018enormous/gigantic\u2019 increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the DNC headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation offices in New York City.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is classic Kremlin disinformation, taking a bit of fact and adding a great deal of fiction to smear Moscow\u2019s opponents, yet it bears noting that all the major claims made by Team Trump in the year since Seth Rich\u2019s murder were there, in the \u201cSVR report,\u201d just days after the killing.\u000a\u000aHere we have Seth Rich rather than Russian spies as the \u201creal\u201d source of Hillary\u2019s emails. There\u2019s a DNC cover-up of the true, awful story. There\u2019s Clintonian corruption and multiple assassinations. There\u2019s even a dirty, complicit FBI Director James Comey protecting Hillary and her \u201chit team.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt didn\u2019t take long for Kremlin mouthpieces to jump on the bandwagon. By early August 2016, Wikileaks, led by Julian Assange, was implying that Rich was the source of the stolen DNC emails that the \u201cprivacy advocates\u201d dumped online less than two weeks after his murder. On August 9, Wikileaks announced on Twitter a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich\u2019s killer.\u000a\u000aOn the very same day, Trump\u2019s dirty-trickster pal Roger Stone tweeted that Seth Rich was the \u201c4th mysterious death connected to the DNC in less than a month\u201d and suggested Hillary was behind the killings. Perhaps not coincidentally, Stone has admitted he possesses a \u201cback-channel\u201d to Assange, who\u2019s been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy for more than five years.\u000a\u000aOnce Assange and Stone co-tweeted about Seth Rich, pro-Trump social media went wild with the unsubstantiated accusations, making it a standard far-right trope. It eventually culminated in the quickly discredited mid-May 2017 Sean Hannity \u201cbombshell\u201d on Fox News, which the White House allegedly had a direct hand in.\u000a\u000aTo complete the disinformation circle and bring this Kremlin lie back to where it started, on May 19, 2017, the Russian embassy in London approvingly cited Hannity and Fox News with a provocative tweet stating, \u201cWikileaks informer Seth Rich murdered in US but GB MSM was so busy accusing Russian hackers to take notice.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is but one example of how the Kremlin and Team Trump collude to spread lies to the public\u2014albeit a deeply troubling one, given its maligning of a murdered young American who cannot speak in his own defense. Such operations are ongoing and have become a staple of daily Trump administration operations.\u000a\u000aTake the current online smear campaign against Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, the National Security Adviser, who\u2019s hated by the far-right for his recent purging of pro-Moscow extremists from the NSC staff. This has raised the ire of pro-Trump social media, leading to vile, concocted accusations of McMaster being controlled by Jewish financiers while being anti-Israel at the same time. As if that smear were not enough, pro-Trump \u201cinvestigators\u201d known to have tight links to the White House have spread ugly rumors about McMaster\u2019s personal life.\u000a\u000aMoscow\u2019s hand is easily detectable behind this vicious online campaign. A new analysis conclusively demonstrates the key role of Kremlin propagandists behind the #FireMcMaster Twitter hashtag effort to coax the president into cashiering his national security adviser. Here the usual alt-right suspects got the ball rolling: InfoWars and Breitbart, backed by pro-Kremlin online trolls. Bots\u2014that is, automated Twitter accounts guided by software, not a human\u2014have been crucial to the #FireMcMaster campaign as well, and their role in online Kremlin propaganda is growing rapidly.\u000a\u000aTrump himself just showed his hand by retweeting and praising \u201cNicole Mincey,\u201d a young African-American superfan who turns out to not actually exist and may actually be a Russian bot. Given the extent of Russian online assistance to Team Trump in its ceaseless media war against fellow Americans, citizens should have questions about what\u2019s really going on here and who\u2019s pulling the strings.\u000a\u000aThe White House, too, should be concerned. Now that the Kremlin is openly signaling its disapproval of Trump in the wake of his embarrassing failure to stop increased congressional sanctions on Russia, Vladimir Putin\u2019s powerful propaganda apparatus seems to be turning on its once-promising protégé\u2014precisely as I told you it would. Analysts are noting that Russian Twitter bots are starting to target prominent Republicans, not just opponents of President Trump. It seems only a matter of time until Russian intelligence takes aim at the White House too.\u000a\u000aJohn Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer.

aVAssemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex) has decided not to run for Congress in New Jersey\u2019s 11th congressional district, where Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican who has held the seat for decades, for the first time in years is facing intense scrutiny and several challengers.\u000a\u000aMcKeon, a top Assembly Democrat, met with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee earlier this year as he weighed a challenge to the 22-year incumbent. But on Tuesday, McKeon said he planned to stay put. McKeon is running for re-election to the Assembly this year. The governor\u2019s race is also set for November.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the voters choose to return me to the Legislature this November, I will have the honor of serving as a senior member of the Assembly,\u201d McKeon said in a statement. \u201cWith a Democratic governor in Trenton, I hope to be an integral part of the solution as New Jersey faces some of its most challenging times. Therefore, at this time I have decided to not run for Congress next year. My heartfelt appreciation goes to my family, friends, party leaders, longtime supporters, the DCCC and the members of Congress who encouraged and helped me with this process.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcKeon was talked about as one of the most formidable potential challengers to Frelinghuysen. But the Republican congressman is a well funded incumbent who chairs the powerful House Appropriations Committee, and he\u2019s gearing up for an intense re-election battle next year.\u000a\u000aA number of other candidates are already in the ring. Earlier this year, both former federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill and Freeholder John Bartlett formally announced they were running in the 2018 Democratic primary. On Tuesday, Woodland Park Mayor Keith Kazmark announced that he had formed an exploratory committee to weigh a congressional run.\u000a\u000aMcKeon said he plans to continue to support the growing activist movement against Frelinghuysen. In the district, groups like NJ 11th for Change and BlueWave NJ have been critical of Frelinghuysen for not holding town hall events and for his support of the Republican American Health Care Act. McKeon said he plans to work with the eventual Democratic nominee and groups in the district to continue to put the pressure on Frelinghusyen.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, more than ever, we need a strong Democratic standard bearer to represent our values in the 2018 Congressional race,\u201d McKeon\u2019s statement said. \u201cThere are many who formally and informally have expressed a willingness to take up that mantle here in the 11th and I am convinced that any one of them would do so with honor and distinction, and ultimately be successful.\u201d

aVIt\u2019s always interesting to see actors and filmmakers branch out into previously unexplored genres. Tackling new material is like an experiment that fans get to watch unfold in real time. That\u2019s why moviegoers should be so intrigued with Darren Aronofsky\u2019s upcoming horror film mother! starring Jennifer Lawrence and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Both star and director will be entering the horror genre\u2014which has quietly become the most consistent box office weapon for Hollywood studios\u2014for the first time. Here\u2019s the film\u2019s first full length trailer:\u000a\u000aAnd here\u2019s the film\u2019s purposely vague official synopsis: \u201cA couple\u2019s relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.\u201d That combo is a sufficiently creepy kickoff to this promotional campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ve come to see me,\u201d Javier Bardem\u2019s character coos in the trailer. Is this a classic case of \u201cmy husband is not who I thought he was?\u201d It\u2019s hard to tell as the trailer is intentionally mysterious. Clearly, there are going to me some questions that need a thorough unpacking as J-Law does battle with her sinister house guests.\u000a\u000aAronofsky has always been one of cinema\u2019s most unique directors and it looks like he\u2019s drawing on several inspirations while putting his own touch on things in mother! Will this be a groundbreaking new hit for him after the relative disappointment of 2014\u2019s Noah? And will this get Lawrence back in the win column? Quietly, Lawrence hasn\u2019t enjoyed a real hit in a few years as The Hunger Games franchise limped to the finish line and Joy, X-Men: Apocalypse and Passengers all underperformed.\u000a\u000amother! also stars Michelle Pfeiffer, Domhnall Gleeson, Ed Harris and Kristen Wiig. The film will hit theaters on September 15 and compete with It and Stranger Things for the Halloween season headlines.

aV\u201cCome for a day, stay for a week,\u201d reads the tourism website of Cold Spring, New York. That\u2019s a fine slogan, but it did not, alas, apply to our intrepid contestants on Bravo\u2019s Work of Art: The Next Great Artist this week, who were destined to hop a train from Grand Central for a brief, nervous jaunt up and down the town\u2019s Main Street, during which time they marveled at how picturesque (read: creepy) everything was and how weird the locals were, before fleeing back to the (much less weird and creepy) world of reality television.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe name makes it sound like it has something to do with spa treatments,\u201d contestant Young Sun Han murmured rapturously, as if he\u2019d just discovered a Shangri-La for TV\u2019s gay stereotypes. (Look, there\u2019s village councilman Sean Hayes!)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe further we get away from the city the more it looks like home to me,\u201d Dusty meanwhile drawled sweetly. We\u2019ve ridden Metro North\u2019s Hudson Line, and the back lots of New England mini malls do not particularly resemble Arkansas\u2019s amber waves of grain, in our humble opinion.\u000a\u000a\u201cWelcome to the quaint town of Cold Spring, New York,\u201d says show hostess/rich person China Chow, looking like a Strangers on a Train murderess in a big trench coat. Two people were going to get the boot, we learned. But, \u201cIf you survive this challenge you will be competing for the grand prize,\u201d Ms. Chow threatened. Survive this challenge? Is that what they\u2019ve been doing with the eliminated contestants? The challenge, if you\u2019re interested, was to take $200 and find a way to create a portrait of a verifiable, salt of the Thornton Wilder-ian earth Cold Spring resident.\u000a\u000aKYMIA NAWABI\u000a\u000a\u201cI have laryngitis today,\u201d rasps the first quaint resident that Ms. Nawabi hassled. But fear not, for Bob and Barbara, owners of some kind of haunted tchochke shop, rise to the occasion, proving themselves to be part charming Stars Hollow, part \u201call work and no play.\u201d In Ms. Nawabi\u2019s terms, they\u2019re a solid blend of \u201cweirdness and also sweetness.\u201d The couple, we learn, has \u201calways loved dolls.\u201d So Ms. Nawabi makes a kind of dark, demonic Norman Rockwell painting of the duo, portraying them as ice skaters in front of scary antique miscellany\u2014they skated on their first date. \u201cThe only non-conventional thing is that they\u2019re going to have several arms,\u201d artist mentor/auctioneer Simon de Pury frets of Ms. Nawabi\u2019s painting. Which is funny, because when he gesticulates, he looks like a stop-motion photograph of a pitcher. \u201cGet some weirdness in it,\u201d he cautions.\u000a\u000aYOUNG SUN HAN\u000a\u000aMr. Han makes a beeline to the nearest bed and breakfast, to inquire about spa treatments and also \u201ctown secrets,\u201d because he\u2019s clearly been watching The Witches of Eastwick, and believes the two go hand in hand. While he gets a guided tour of the inn\u2019s nine rooms, variously furnished with Jacuzzis and wood-burning fireplaces he is left scrambling, at the very last moment, for a subject. Luckily, he pinpoints the next great artist of Cold Spring at the Terence Donovan gallery\u2014namely, jolly Mr. Donovan himself, whom Mr. Han pays $200 for a 20-minute portrait. And guess what? Terence\u2019s portrait is really nice\u2014it\u2019s got a little Karen Kilimnik, or even Elizabeth Peyton in its saucy yet tender broad-stroked depiction of its young male subject. (\u201cYou have kind of Justin Bieber-ish hair,\u201d Terence says, which is totally something we can imagine Ms. Peyton saying to any of her sweetly puckish subjects.) In the gallery, Mr. Han leans Terence\u2019s painting against a wall, behind wooden planks plastered with extreme-close-up photographs of Terence that he took of the artist while he worked.\u000a\u000aLOLA THOMPSON\u000a\u000aHaving been soundly rejected by the town motorcycle guy, Ms. Thompson seeks out the men who are next on the list of people most likely to succumb to her witchy ways and nymphette wiles. Dennis and Tommy, rare-coin-collecting gentlemen, succumb to her flirtation, handing over a 1928 five-dollar bill to her. Ms. Thompson then prepares a multi-faceted, mostly non-figurative portrait/tribute to the two collectors, featuring a letter she wrote to them, which begins, \u201cDear Dennis and Tommy, You are the secret historians of Cold Spring\u201d (or maybe not so secret\u2026). There\u2019s also some tinfoil, and a pyramid of blown-up images of historic bills, and some other things on a shelf.\u000a\u000aDUSTY MITCHELL\u000a\u000aMr. Mitchell shyly settles on a little girl as his subject. She likes candy\u2014\u201call kinds!\u201d\u2014 and reminds the contestant of his daughter Cora, whom he abandoned in her infancy to go off to (an art-reality-TV) battle, and who, when this episode was filmed, had just turned one the previous day. Mr. Mitchell decides to make a mosaic of his young subject\u2019s face from M&Ms. Mr. de Pury\u2014who, in his most hilarious joke of season two, says he wants to \u201ccome to AR-Kansas\u201d\u2014briefly convinces Mr. Mitchell to work on a portrait made from folded-paper fortune-tellers, before the contestant runs out of time and returns to his candy idea. By that point, however, it\u2019s too late for the glue to dry, so M&Ms keep falling off it. Mr. Mitchell hopes that everyone will find this decomposition \u201cinteresting.\u201d\u000a\u000aSARA JIMENEZ\u000a\u000aBecause she always seems wryly uninterested in everything around her, Ms. Jimenez drives away her first potential subject, before finding friends among the local firemen. One older firefighter, Jackie, is of particular interest to Ms. Jimenez. He\u2019s battled blazes for 58 years, thereby inspiring a quite charming backlit portrait made from aluminum (which weirdly kind of resembles Mao) paired with an uninspiring dangly sculpture of aluminum and charcoal nameplates, one for every year Jackie served.\u000a\u000aTHE CRITIQUE\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s guest judge is pop-star portraitist Richard Phillips, who, for the record, is much taller than critic/judge Jerry Saltz and Ms. Chow, even in her crazy-tall heels, but maybe not taller than gallerist/judge Bill Powers\u2019 hair. The local portrait subjects show up for the gallery showing, and luckily enough, none of them are perceptibly offended by their variously unflattering, candy-coated, epistolary and so forth depictions.\u000a\u000aWINNER\u000a\u000aKymia Nawabi wins the first slot on the final episode for her cartoonish portrait because, as Ms. Chow says of Bob and Barbara, \u201cI met them and they\u2019re cartoons!\u201d That\u2019s not very nice, we think, and neither is Mr. Phillips\u2019 comment on the piece: \u201cAt first I was throwing up inside.\u201d But apparently none of that matters when you\u2019re in the final trio of possible next great artists.\u000a\u000aALSO HEADED TO THE FINALE\u000a\u000aYoung Sun Han, who we think should probably be facing an intellectual-property/copyright suit from Terence right about now, slinks by, even though the judges point out that he should have just shown Terence\u2019s painting. (Weird how the next great artist is not even a contestant on this show\u2026 Team Terence!) Sara Jimenez, meanwhile, also will compete in the final episode, mostly because Mr. Saltz is so proud that his little charge worked outside of her \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d Personally, we\u2019re freaked out that she referred to her portrait of Jackie (who\u2019s alive and thriving) as a \u201cmemorial.\u201d\u000a\u000aGOING HOME\u000a\u000aDusty Mitchell is at last taking that long covered-wagon ride back to Arkansas, mostly because too many of his artworks were literally paint-by-numbers pieces. And Lola Thompson will hop Al Pacino\u2019s jet back to Los Angeles because Ms. Chow doesn\u2019t understand why the currency pyramid counts as a portrait (odd, since Ms. Chow resembles money). Also, it\u2019s too scattered in its abstraction for the rest of the judges. And there is much crying.

It\u2019s a wave we noted last year. But over the last 12 months, the blurred lines have continued transforming the business in ways that are surprising even industry veterans. \u201cClients aren\u2019t choosing specializations anymore,\u201d said Salzman, whose company now brings in just a third of revenue from conventional media relations. \u201cThey\u2019re choosing people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNelson Fernandez, North American chairman of APCO Worldwide and its managing director in New York, agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a convergence between PR, advertising and digital. It\u2019s channel-agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who understands how to get inside people\u2019s heads. We\u2019re the ones who can read trends in how people are connecting, behaving and communicating. And if we keep doing that, I think we\u2019ll continue to be a very important\u2014perhaps the most important\u2014part of the marketing mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgencies are even moving away from describing themselves as PR firms. \u201cWe are content providers and distributors. Media relations no longer defines what we do,\u201d said Florence Quinn, founder of Quinn, the travel and lifestyle powerhouse. \u201cWe create strong ideas that resonate with people and the media. This is incredibly exciting because there are a gajillion ways to produce content and even more ways to distribute it. The line between earned and paid media has been crossed forever; there is no going back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt firms like Sunshine Sachs, whose clients range from A-list celebs (Lin-Manuel Miranda to blue-chip nonprofits (Human Rights Campaign) to corporations like Facebook, the transformation\u2019s been even more radical. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 35 people who don\u2019t do traditional communications,\u201d said Shawn Sachs, the firm\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant for a firm with about 160 people. We hired our second art director this year. If you\u2019d said that 10 years ago, people would have thought you were crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the broadest sense, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re a communications company. But we\u2019re also an advertising company, a marketing company, a digital company, an events company, an idea company. We\u2019re a lot of things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe upheaval in media has also transformed what clients need, said Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of entertainment and marketing giant PMK*BNC\u2014and agencies like hers have benefited.\u000a\u000a\u201cSharing and providing content\u2014that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Berger said. \u201cOur ability is to really craft a narrative for a specific client, pursue media for that client, work with influencers and generate partnerships, whether they\u2019re brand related or fan-related. Fans are partners too. Our job is to make sure fans download the book, buy the record or use a provider we\u2019re working with.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t give up on traditional PR just yet, said Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick, where more than two-thirds of growth is coming from digital, social and content-marketing arm Mediaco. \u201cWe call ourselves an engagement firm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, it\u2019s a mistake to decide you\u2019re no longer in the public relations business. If you think about changes in the media world, and the impact earned media still has, PR continues to be absolutely critical. Sure, we\u2019ve evolved as a firm. But we\u2019re proud of our heritage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd while creative destruction hasn\u2019t been great for media, it\u2019s keeping PR mavens buoyantly optimistic (and well compensated\u2014according to The Holmes Report, the global PR industry grossed $14.2 billion in 2015).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in the message business,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cAnd our business is as exciting and interesting as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: New York\u2019s Top Specialty PR Agencies\u000a\u000aA word about the PR Power 50 list:\u000a\u000aRather than rely on revenue or size as criteria for our rankings, the Observer considers subjective factors. What kind of year did a firm have? Did it hire superstars? Has it won covetable clients? Does it feel like the agency\u2019s got momentum and juice? Did it avoid serious screw-ups\u2014or at least keep its screw-ups out of view? And, of course, did its people return our calls and emails?\u000a\u000aEvery one of the 50 firms we\u2019ve chosen pushed those buttons, but our agency of the year for 2016 boasted an especially stellar performance. We\u2019re eager to hear what you think about where the industry\u2019s been this year\u2014and where it\u2019s going in 2017 and beyond.
