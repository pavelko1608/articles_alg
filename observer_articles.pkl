VSo imagine working on a road crew in the summer, driving around the state patching potholes and painting lines on highways. It has to be on of the roughest jobs out there, but your boss comes up to you and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job for you where you get to sit in the air conditioned truck cabin all day. All you have to do is drive slowly.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo then you say, \u201cSounds great. What\u2019s my truck doing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, it\u2019s really easy,\u201d your boss says. \u201cIt\u2019s just there to take the hit if a semi comes around the bend going 75 miles per hour and doesn\u2019t slow down as it approaches our road crew running about 60 miles per hour slower.\u201d\u000a\u000aDoes that seem like a crazy job? Maybe so, but this is real work that real human beings have in the real world. According to the Department of Transportation, work zone crashes have been on the rise, with more than 9,000 in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust in the last four years, there have been 26 incidents where a member of the traveling public struck a CDOT impact protection vehicle\u2014that\u2019s almost seven per year,\u201d Shailen Bhatt, CDOT\u2019s executive director, said in a press release. \u201cThis is a dangerously high number when you consider that in some instances, a CDOT employee is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle that was hit.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf ever a job were ripe to be stolen by a robot, this is one. Colorado recently demo\u2019ed a self-driving system built so that no human has to sit inside the truck built to absorb collisions. The truck mounted attenuator (also known as a crash truck) will very precisely follow a work zone vehicle. By running driverless, the robot crash truck protects people riding in the lead vehicle without putting any human beings in danger.\u000a\u000aColorado has released a video of the first public demonstration drive. The demonstration took place in Fort Collins (home of Colorado State), during a real operation where a road crew repainted lines on a segment of road while the crash truck followed along. The video is shot from above at a distance, so viewers can see the lines on the road getting brighter as the paint truck drives by. Inside the cab of the following truck, it\u2019s clear that there is no one in there.\u000a\u000aThe self-driving system has some other advantages over a human operator. It uses an extremely precise GPS system designed to match the lead vehicle\u2019s route within 4 inches. This is important because drives are insane people. As CDOT personnel explain in the video, when a following crash truck lets too much space open up between it and the working vehicle, drivers will sometimes slip in between them in order to pass both in oncoming traffic. Keeping that distance as tight as is safely feasible should discourage this behavior.\u000a\u000aSecond, in a collision, the truck needs to stop as quickly as possible. If it\u2019s hit hard, it\u2019s important that the brakes are applied quickly to help prevent it from slamming into the vehicle with the workers. A self-driving system will have better reaction times in such a situation than a human.\u000a\u000aThe truck is also equipped with camera and speed detection technology so it will have an accurate record of events leading up to any collisions. Crew in the lead vehicle also have access to data about the robot truck\u2019s performance and remote controls in case of emergency operations.\u000a\u000aWhen we spoke to CDOT for our recent investigation into rules around testing autonomous vehicles, a spokesperson expressed enthusiasm for the industry. EasyMile, one of the leaders in the autonomous trolley industry, set up its U.S. HQ in Denver this month, according to the Denver Post.\u000a\u000aColorado claims that this is the first live demonstration of one of the vehicles on an active road during a real operation. No details have been released yet about how many of these trucks are in operation in the state or a timeline for completely automating this role. The autonomous impact protection vehicle truck is a project of CDOT\u2019s technology project, RoadX. The truck was built in collaboration with Colas UK (which has been testing this technology), Royal Truck & Equipment (which built the truck), and Kratos Defense (which enabled autonomous functions).\u000a\u000aUp to this point, Kratos has specialized in building autonomous systems for combat situations in order to minimize risk for the armed forces. This is a new direction for the company, but the same principle applies: taking workers out of harms way.\u000a\u000aGood jobs are tough to come by, especially for blue collar workers, but this seems like one gig that everyone can agree is better taken off the payroll.

aVAnyone who has watched Adam Conover\u2019s show Adam Ruins Everything has learned by now that pretty much all we know to be true and good in this world is a lie, a construct and scam. At least that\u2019s the basic gist of Conover\u2019s expose-style, satire-laden show for TruTV, in which he dispels commonly accepted myths across a spectrum of subjects, from the food service industry to voting and online dating. In his latest episode, which aired a short clip on August 8 online via College Humor, the comedian takes on yet another complicated industry: the art market. What does he conclude?\u000a\u000a\u201cGood news, aspiring artists! The world of fine art is manipulated financially AND extremely exclusive!\u201d reads a brief description on the clip\u2019s YouTube page, which had garnered over 1.3 million views after just 24 hours of being posted.\u000a\u000aThe segment, which covers how the pricing hierarchy of the gallery system is non-transparent and often highly subjective, why auction houses use tricks and tactics to control bidding and how mosts artists face slim chances of achieving stardom without the invisible hand of the market acting in their favor, may be eye opening for the unfamiliar but is well-trodden territory for insiders. The art market\u2019s unregulated nature and seemingly ever-rising record sales prices sales have been well-documented in the past several decades. (Filmmaker Barry Avrich tackled many of these subjects in his documentary Blurred Lines, which just premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival this year.) But, Conover\u2019s takedown of the industry does make the seemingly harsh realities of the art world ecosystem entertaining in this shortened, condensed and comical tour.

aVNear Mint, is our weekly comics column where we discuss all the KAPOW! that\u2019s fit to print. This week: celebrating the 100th birthday of crackling comics god, Jack Kirby\u000a\u000aThere is only one real king of superhero comics, Jack Kirby. Compared to his kinetic American hieroglyphs, the battling heroes in films like the Avengers look like little more than plastic toy soldiers. He\u2019s the artist behind numerous Marvel titles including Fantastic Four, X-Men, and also New Gods at DC. To name all of the characters he had a hand in creating would take the length of this article. Kirby, whose career spanned nearly 60 years of comics, died on February 6th, 1994. But this Monday, August 28th, marks his 100th birthday, and Kirby crazed comics fans are gearing up to celebrate his legacy.\u000a\u000aJack is survived by his extended family, including his granddaughter Jillian Kirby, who raises money for comics professionals in need of financial and medical aid in an often fickle industry. Her project, Kirby4heroes, is perhaps most known for their event, Wake Up and Draw, in which artists create and auction off work on Kirby\u2019s birthday. \u201cI wanted to do something to honor my grandfather\u2019s legacy,\u201d Jillian commented on the Women of Marvel podcast. This Monday, artist Brent Schoonover will be drawing 100 Kirby inspired artworks at The Source comics and games store in Roseville, Minnesota. Artist Phil Hester has also pledged to draw 100 Kirby\u2019s on Monday, all of which have already sold. The Kirby Collector, a long-running magazine, will be publishing a special edition, Kirby100, featuring tribute art from 100 comic pros including Jim Lee, Wendy Pini and Alex Ross. Other tributes include a panel at Comic-Con last month, and a campaign for a Kirby google doodle.\u000a\u000aKirby\u2019s influence has been so profound that there is even a Jack Kirby Museum & Research Center, which will be hosting a series of parties and talks at One Art Space in New York throughout next week. To get to know Jack better, I spoke to Rand Hoppe, a founding trustee of the Kirby Museum. Rand revealed how Jack\u2019s life experiences influenced his work.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis Kirby tech\u2014his way of drawing technology\u2014was inspired by visits to the sweatshops where his parents worked on the lower east side,\u201d says Hoppe. \u201cHe saw these looms and the steam generators when he was a little kid. He was awestruck by their largeness and complexity, and it ended up in his artwork.\u201d A dark origin for such a colorful artist, but Kirby\u2019s youth was less than picture perfect. Perhaps he was trying to find beauty in the industrial bleakness of the early 20th century? \u201cHe was a kid from the tough streets of the lower east side\u201d Rand acknowledged. \u201cHe also had some brutal WWII experiences which informed his work.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring his time in the service, Kirby\u2019s commanding officer assigned him the role of a scout who would go behind enemy lines to draw tank locations; a spy of sorts. According to Rand, there may be a connection between Jack Kirby\u2019s time as a scout and the character the Silver Surfer, who reluctantly scouts planets for the world eating space god, Galactus. Taking this metaphor to its endpoint, Rand suggests that Kirby viewed America itself as a dangerous omnipotent God to whom he found himself in conflicted service. By the time he served in WWII, Kirby had already created Captain America with Joe Simon. Cap was seen punching Hitler on the cover of Captain America #1 in the December of 1940, a full year before Pearl Harbor and U.S. involvement in the war. Kirby was insistent that he pencil the first issue.\u000a\u000aWhile it has been many decades since Jack\u2019s work first hit newsstands, he remains something of a soothsayer. Today we see superheroes as our modern mythology, but according to Rand that was always Jack\u2019s vision. \u201cAt the first San Diego Comic-Con [in 1970] he was like, \u2018yeah, Hollywood is gonna come to this convention to look for ideas,\u2019 and everyone looked at him like he was nuts!\u201d Rand laughs. \u201c but he was right!\u201d Unfortunately, some of Jack\u2019s visions have been a bit darker. At the Daily Beast, writer Elana Levin posits that Kirby predicted Trump with the Glorious Godfrey, a posturing blonde supervillain who drives the masses to fascism and gives them special hats.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most visible celebration of Kirby\u2019s 100th is a series of specials from DC, which venerate some of Jack\u2019s more obscure work. The strongest effort thus far has been the Manhunter and Sandman one shots. Sandman\u2019s pages pull on the heartstrings by bringing Jack Kirby himself into the comic as a character. It\u2019s an expected ploy, but an effective one. The Manhunter story, with layouts by Keith Giffen and art by Mark Buckingham, captures Kirby\u2019s penchant for acrobatic choreography. A Mister Miracle/Black Racer comic, written by former BET president Reginald Hudlin, is set to come out next week. Yet the real star of all these mags is the Jack Kirby shorts that crackle in the back of each issue.\u000a\u000aIn a dozen or so creator interviews posted recently on Marvel.com, artists and writers like Mike Allred and Brandon Montclare talk about Jack\u2019s influence. Almost every single one of them regards Jack as a huge influence on their work. From the X-Men to Devil Dinosaur, these writers still refer to Jack\u2019s source material when crafting projects with the characters he created. As for this comic zealot, the Kirby story which means the most to me is \u201cThis Man\u2026 This Monster!\u201d printed in #54 of Fantastic Four, where a mad scientist jealous of Reed Richard\u2019s success infiltrates the Fantastic Four disguised as the Thing. Instead of getting revenge, the man finds friendship amongst the Fantastic Four, and ends up giving his life to save Reed. It\u2019s a tearjerker, and an oddity of a superhero comic; There are no fight scenes and the collage in the middle of the issue is perhaps my favorite work of art.\u000a\u000aEnough from me, the best way to remember Kirby is in his own words. Let\u2019s end these musings with a message from Jack, taken from the 1987 documentary The Masters Of Comic Book Art. Here\u2019s hoping that his legacy can remain in the DNA of comics for many years to come.

aVHow do you make a penguin even cuter? By strapping GoPros to its head and back.\u000a\u000aResearchers from the Korea Polar Research Institute chose 26 Gentoo penguins at random and stuck the cameras to their bodies using waterproof tape. They then observed the creatures during two Antarctic breeding seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016). The findings were published this week in the online journal Scientific Reports.\u000a\u000aSome of the most important discoveries involved animal communication. The scientists recorded 598 penguin calls and found out they\u2019re not just adorable, they\u2019re multipurpose\u2014penguins honk to exchange information, form groups and coordinate movements. Researchers were especially interested in \u201coffshore calls,\u201d or the sounds penguins make when they\u2019re out swimming.\u000a\u000aThese calls are pretty effective\u2014almost 50 percent of the time, penguins formed groups or swam to new areas within a minute of hearing a call.\u000a\u000aThere are also more specialized calls\u2014for example, hungry chicks let out a \u201cbegging moan\u201d when they\u2019re asking for food.\u000a\u000aWhen the team examined the video footage, they noticed that the penguins took quick shallow dives after making a call, likely because the calls cost energy and decreased oxygen.\u000a\u000aAside from analyzing dives and acoustics, the scientists also examined the penguins\u2019 foraging and group behavior patterns.\u000a\u000aBut the best part is that the videos the penguins shot are now online. The animals captured some amazing footage of calls and dives.\u000a\u000aThe Korean team plans to continue their penguin research, which means there are more cute videos to come.

aV\u201cThe amazing thing about La Perla is we do lingerie, nightwear and sleepwear, so we can encompass your entire life. From the time you wake up in your pajamas, go to the office wearing our suits, to evening wear and then back to your nighty, we encompass it all,\u201d La Perla\u2019s creative director Julia Haart explained, while curled up in a round leather booth in the Lamb\u2019s Club. The designer was wearing a red zip-up hoodie and an insanely high pair of heeled boots of her own design.\u000a\u000aIt was a chilly February morning, directly following the designer\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 runway extravaganza, where Naomi Campbell donned a silky nighty, Lindsey Wixson walked in a bright purple bralette, Sasha Pivovarova rocked a plaid skirt suit, and Kendall Jenner closed the show in a nearly see-through gown. The models lounged on the couches, chairs and balconies, in a number of different rooms of the \u201cLa Perla Manor\u201d set, before descending a grand staircase and strutting the runway. Taking place on the first day of New York Fashion Week, this grand gesture was an impressive way to start off the season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked the casting agent Piergiorgio [Del Moro] for diversity. I do not want to see 40 white girls, that\u2019s not the world we live in and that\u2019s not the people I want to sell to. I want to dress every woman. I also wanted women with personality. Don\u2019t just give me beautiful women; give me sexy, fun, confident, strong women!\u201d she explained.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Vogue said it best in their runway review. \u201cShe is presumably catering to those women that might tune into the Victoria\u2019s Secret show (as it happens, a number of her Fall cast are also Angels) but would never actually buy Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014all La Perla, all the way,\u201d they wrote. Surely, the Victoria\u2019s Secret formula is there: world-class models, an over-the-top set and plenty of lacy lingerie. But there was more.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very honored, it\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Haart replied, when asked about the comparison. \u201cThe only thing is that Victoria\u2019s Secret is a lingerie show, mine was a ready-to-wear show, so that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges. We may have come from a lingerie background but we have taken it to the next level.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s true. La Perla is a go-to for sexy lace bras and barely there underwear with luxury price tags, but they also offer slinky evening gowns and blazers with wireless bra cups built in. Not only do you factor in your clothing size with a La Perla ready-to-wear purchase, but your bra size is considered, too. Have you ever bought a jacket in a size 38 cup AB? Or a shirt in a 44 cup CD?\u000a\u000aHowever, the starring roles belong to the fabrics used by the company, these firm foundations are truly something to marvel over. Haart has incorporated stretch into nearly every material, offering a silk dress with 10 percent Elastane that is wrinkle-resistant. She has also developed a fine stretch-lace that actually moves with the body. Haart wants women to feel as comfortable in their clothing as they feel in their lingerie. She doesn\u2019t believe that women should have to choose between looking good and feeling comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of my materials have stretch, so you can literally kickbox in everything,\u201d she semi-joked. \u201cNot that you\u2019re necessarily going to want to kickbox in an evening gown, but if the mood instructs you\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAppointed to the creative director role in August 2016, it is clear that the buxom but petite Haart knows a thing or two about finding flattering clothing to fit her frame. She had actually worked with the brand before this past summer; advising the team on two accessories collaborations, starting with the Fall/Winter 2016 season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had my own shoe line, so I first started making shoes for La Perla, as a collaboration. Then it was \u2018Julia can you design handbags?\u2019 And \u2018Julia can you design men\u2019s shoes?\u2019 Eventually, \u2018Can you help with the collection?\u2019 And here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince being installed in this top creative role, Haart has cemented her status as a power player. In December, she co-hosted a celebration for a Goop pop-up in Santa Monica. Gwyneth Paltrow showed up to the dinner in a black corset suit and leggings from La Perla (Ms. P also made a rare front row appearance at the brand\u2019s February fashion show).\u000a\u000aLa Perla also co-sponsored Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2018s Los Angeles celebration of the 150 Most Fashionable Women in January 2017, where Haart appeared on the red carpet sandwiched between Kendall Jenner and Liu Wen (who, if you recall, both walked in recent fashion shows for Victoria\u2019s Secret and La Perla). These two models also starred in the latest La Perla ad campaign, donning suits in celestial prints, dresses decorated with sultry lace and corset details; they shared the campaign with Isabeli Fontana. Shot by Steven Klein and artistically directed by Fabien Baron, this was Haart\u2019s inaugural campaign for the brand. The theme behind the shoot? \u201cThe liberation of every woman from the need to suffer for beauty,\u201d of course. Despite the clothing, the ads still offer a little something for the lingerie fans faithful to the brand since its inception in 1954.\u000a\u000aAlso promoting the ready-to-wear range was the brand\u2019s new Milan flagship, which opened this past fashion week. Located on via Montenapoleone, the new marble-clad store doubled in size, spanning 2,583 square feet over two floors. Haart admitted that the moving to a bigger store was necessary for accommodating her expanded clothing collections. This is understandable when you realize her Fall/Winter 2017 collection contained a whopping 225 pieces.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone keeps asking me \u2018Who is the La Perla woman?\u2019 And I hate that question so much. Who am I to determine what a woman should look like?\u201d Haart expressed in exasperation, back in New York. She went on to explain that she is not precious about how say, a stylist might dress an actress in her designs, many of which are simple tailored staples. She is unconcerned if her looks are paired with other brands, she just wants the La Perla pieces to look good. Haart has set out to dress every woman, to help them embrace their curves and the make them feel comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to make women feel more confident with themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to look in the mirror and say damn I look fine. That\u2019s my only job.

aVThe nationwide controversy over flags and monuments has now found its way into an Alabama high school classroom. But a group of students is using the power of the internet to make sure justice prevails.\u000a\u000aLast week students and parents at Auburn High School started a Change.org petition to protest social studies teacher Donna Yeager, who displays an LGBT Pride flag in her classroom. Yeager moderates the EDUCATE club, which promotes diversity at the school.\u000a\u000aBut the angry families think the Pride flag sows division more than inclusiveness.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe strongly feel that it creates a hostile and provocative learning environment for students not comfortable to openly supporting the LGBTQ+ community in a public school where students come from diverse political and religious backgrounds,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cSubjecting or explicitly exposing students from diverse political backgrounds to political views differing from theirs can make students uncomfortable and distract them from learning the material assigned to them, preventing them from reaching their full potential.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe anger doesn\u2019t stop there, however\u2014the writers actually compare the Pride flag to one of the most infamous symbols of slavery.\u000a\u000a\u201cConsider the uproar and chaos that would ensue were a teacher to hang for example a Confederate, Christian or Heterosexual Flag in their classroom,\u201d the petition reads. It\u2019s not clear what a \u201cHeterosexual flag\u201d would be in this scenario.\u000a\u000aSo far, 810 people have signed the petition\u2014its goal is 1,000 signatures.\u000a\u000aBut fittingly for the era of the counter-protest, a counter-petition has sprung up supporting Yeager and her Pride flag. In their pitch, the creators of this Change.org campaign affirm that their school is \u201ca healthy environment for our LGBT+ peers.\u201d They also fault the writers of the \u201cConfederate\u201d pitch for their close-minded outlook.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the real world, to suggest individuals be isolated from differing political views is an absurdity,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cTo be made uncomfortable by opinions differing to your own is to function as a modern human. Attempting to insulate a student from political discourse would be an insult to their intelligence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of Auburn students seem to agree with this stance\u2014the second petition has over 6,700 signatures, toward a goal of 7,500 names.\u000a\u000aBoth petitions are directed at Auburn High School principal Shannon Pignato, who has not publicly responded to the controversy. Yeager did not respond to an Observer request for comment.\u000a\u000aDr. Karen DeLano, superintendent of the Auburn school system, said in a statement that she is aware of the petitions and the matter is being handled internally.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn our country today, people are often seen addressing their objections through violence and hate,\u201d DeLano said. \u201cIt is my sincere desire to assist our students in learning to address their opinions and their values in a calm and respectful manner.\u201d

aVBridget Kelly and Bill Baroni \u2014 the former Gov. Chris Christie associates sentenced to prison for their role in the Bridgegate scandal \u2014 filed their first briefs Friday in appellate court as they try to overturn their convictions.\u000a\u000aA decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia could take months. In March, Baroni was sentenced to two years while Kelly was sentenced to 18 months in prison for their roles in the Bridegate plot.\u000a\u000aKelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Christie, and Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, were convicted of helping to close two of the three Fort Lee access lanes to the George Washington Bridge for five mornings on the first week of school in September 2013 to punish the borough\u2019s Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for declining to endorse Christie\u2019s re-election in 2013.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors relied heavily on emails and text messages, and testimony from David Wildstein, a former senior Port Authority official who was the mastermind of the scheme. Wildstein, who cooperated extensively with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Newark, was sentenced to three years of probation.\u000a\u000aIn court papers, attorneys for Baroni and Kelly argued that their clients should be acquitted or at least granted a new trial because jurors were permitted by U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton to convict them even if they didn\u2019t think Kelly and Baroni acted with punitive political intent.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose instructions were grossly overbroad and erroneous; as a result, there is no way to know whether the jury accepted the prosecutors\u2019 allegations of vindictive intent, or merely concluded that the lane realignment was poor public policy,\u201d Kelly\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cConsequently, a new trial is necessary even under the government\u2019s wrong-headed legal theories.\u201d\u000a\u000aKelly and Baroni\u2019s lawyers made a similar argument in trial court, but Wigenton rejected them. Among the evidence against Kelly is an email she wrote that read, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d

aVSugar Sammy is a comedian, actor, writer and producer from Montreal. He tours internationally, in English, French, Punjabi and Hindi. He mainly performs stand-up comedy but boasts a large body of work, including three one-man shows, an original TV series on Canada\u2019s French V network and an HBO Canada special (the first of it\u2019s kind). He\u2019s performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal seven years in a row and in his four fluent languages. The Observer sat down with Sammy to discuss his impressive body of work and the unique style he\u2019s developed by performing in such diverse cultural landscapes. Sammy will be headlining Caroline\u2019s Comedy Club in New York City July 13, 14 and 15.\u000a\u000aYou were just in Austin, which leads me to my first question: I know you\u2019re on sort of a U.S. run right now, how\u2019s it been treating you?\u000a\u000aGreat, it\u2019s been fun to discover how different the U.S. is from state to state, from city to city, how different their points of view are, their politics, their demographics, religious beliefs, it changes depending on what area of the country you\u2019re in. You know, one of the things they say about America right now is that it\u2019s so divided. I mean, America is also so diverse in terms of its composition, but the diversity doesn\u2019t melt together. It\u2019s diversity by region, it\u2019s weird.\u000a\u000aYeah, it\u2019s kind of atomized in a weird way, especially right now, but it makes sense that you would notice that as someone who speaks four different languages, tours internationally and things like that. How do you find yourself adjusting your material when you travel?\u000a\u000aThe material is the same, what changes is the reactions. But a lot of times I\u2019m surprised, I was just in Naples, Florida, which is one of the highest populations of Trump voters. I was bringing my material there, coming from a Canadian perspective, and I was really surprised because these people were losing their minds laughing at this material where I was nervous going in there, I was like, \u201cI know it\u2019ll work in Seattle, I know it\u2019ll work in San Jose, I know it\u2019ll work in different places, but I was completely surprised by how well it worked there.\u000a\u000aDid you book Naples for that reason?\u000a\u000aI booked Naples because they wanted to book me. A lot of snowbirds\u2014a lot of Canadians\u2014go there for the winter, so they\u2019ve been bugging the comedy clubs to book me there. I was also insisting on doing it because I wanted to test the material democratically everywhere.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s one thing about road comics\u2014you don\u2019t get into bubbles a lot of the time. You\u2019re not just talking to your own people. Did a lot of Canadians come see you?\u000a\u000aA lot, but also social media gets a lot of people in. Also I used to tour the states, I used to headline the states a lot from around 2009 to 2011, whereas currently I\u2019m spending a lot of time in Canada and Europe, so I have a lot of fans here that it\u2019s been good to get back to, to say I\u2019m back.\u000a\u000aTell me about that. When you perform in France, and you perform in other languages, do you find that comedy works differently in other languages\u2014or is it more of a cultural thing?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s more of a cultural thing, that\u2019s so interesting, you\u2019re the first person that\u2019s asked that question. It\u2019s not a linguistic thing. Linguistically, you have to adjust a little bit in that you have to make sure you get to the punchline as quickly as possible, but the material stays the same and the structure stays the same, you just gotta find that bridge between the language and the way it works because it was constructed in English, but it works in other languages. I\u2019ve done it French, Hindi and Punjabi, and you just gotta find the cultural material that connects to that audience. Linguistically, if I had a French or Indian audience in New York, I\u2019d do the same material I do about the states, but I\u2019d do it in French, and it still works.\u000a\u000aA lot of people will say that with something like, let\u2019s say, hip-hop, that it only works in English style rhyme scheming or something.\u000a\u000aHip-hop is more beautiful in French! You gotta check out this rapper, he\u2019s a legend in France, he\u2019s called MC Solaar, in French his stuff flows better. And similarly France is now starting to have the stand up tradition. I think the difference was for years they\u2019d have these one-man shows where they\u2019d be doing characters and their mom and their uncle and stuff like that, like what you guys would call an Off-Broadway show or whatever, but in the last five years we\u2019ve seen these stand ups come out. And it\u2019s the art form that becomes the norm. Five years ago when they were doing these one man shows they\u2019d ask me, \u201cWould your material work there?\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople who\u2019ve done Edinburgh say it\u2019s like that a lot of the time. They\u2019d do these tight New York one-liners, and people just didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u000a\u000aYeah, but you just gotta do what you do best. You can break through with them a lot; that\u2019s the art form\u2014it\u2019s more conversational. And even if it\u2019s a cultural shock for a second, you can get through to them. It doesn\u2019t feel like this guy\u2019s just doing this schtick up there where he doesn\u2019t acknowledge us and he\u2019s just doing the same stuff every night. There\u2019s all these improvisational elements going on. It\u2019s a lot like jazz in that they\u2019d do five or six shows a weekend and record all of them and then pick the one they liked the best, because it\u2019s not gonna be the same show, it changes depending on the audience. And there\u2019s that dance with the audience that\u2019s the important part, they\u2019re listening to us as much as we\u2019re listening to them.\u000a\u000aYour material is very crowd-work heavy and that makes a lot of sense. Somebody once told me the audience is like an instrument and when you\u2019re doing crowd work you\u2019re like jamming, you know?\u000a\u000aYeah! That\u2019s so true.\u000a\u000aSo where\u2019d that style come from? I\u2019ve noticed with crowd work and people that are really good at it, they work in clubs a lot, like proper comedy clubs where the audience is people that are on dates as opposed to audiences in bars or what have you. You came up in Canada right?\u000a\u000aI came up in Canada but I toured everywhere, but I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of our headliners in Canada and England are really good at crowd work because we value the emcee role a lot, so what happens is, a lot of headliners, when they have a weekend off, they host. And it\u2019s valued and paid the same as headlining because it\u2019s treated like the most important role in that show, Whereas here it\u2019s different, the hierarchy and pay is different. In England it\u2019s always been a five-man show where there\u2019s four headliners doing 20 minutes apiece and an emcee, and everyone gets paid evenly, and you\u2019ll see headliners emcee very easily.\u000a\u000aSo did you do a lot of that?\u000a\u000aI did a lot of that, and so you develop that skill very easily, and I just find it becomes a very fun part of the show. I\u2019ll have my material but I like going and using the crowd and talking to them, who knows, something might happen, or I\u2019ll bounce ideas for a new bit off of them. And also, I\u2019ll tape every show and the best crowd work, I\u2019ll use that as promotional material, because you don\u2019t want to burn your actual material you know? It\u2019s not like music where they want to hear the same joke over and over. So it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving them a part of the show without burning any of the show.\u000a\u000aDo you find that when you travel, are you trying to bring what you do to those new places or are you adjusting to how they respond?\u000a\u000aI think a bit of both, I bring what I do, but I make it about them. Like you said about being an anthropologist, like when I go to France I notice these little tiny things that are commonplace for them and then I point them out and it becomes funny because they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right it\u2019s funny, but we never talk about it,\u201d but I also talk about myself and the Canadians point of view and how we\u2019re different. And you can\u2019t be a caricature, you can\u2019t do it from afar, you gotta be immersed in it. It\u2019s happening as I\u2019m in New York right now, I\u2019m noticing these things.\u000a\u000aHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been in New York?\u000a\u000aI was here last month, at the French Comedy Festival. I hosted one gala in English. It was all French comedians doing comedy in English for the first time and a few Americans, and then I played my show in French for a half-French crowd and a half-Québécois crowd, and I like that; I like it when I have to switch languages and switch cultures because it keeps your brain sharp\u2014you\u2019re always working, you\u2019re never on autopilot.\u000a\u000aYeah, you definitely have to keep yourself in the moment so you don\u2019t become a robot.\u000a\u000aYeah, and that\u2019s the danger, that\u2019s why I like the crowd work, and that\u2019s why I like moving around. You know, I was touring Quebec for five years, and I was having a great time, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was growing as a writer, as soon as I flew into France my writer brain went crazy. I would be up all night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019d be having to write all this stuff down. I feel like you have to get out of your comfort zone, which is why I like going to other countries so much.\u000a\u000aPeople say that about writer\u2019s block, that you have to shake things up, but then the question is always, How? That seems like a really good answer. Man, this is fun. I feel like I could pick your brain all day. We could do a full Maron episode right now, but I\u2019ve got to let you go. So, to round things out, let\u2019s talk about your career. You\u2019ve accomplished quite a bit: What\u2019s next? Tell me about the future.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s always about doing more, doing something different. For me it\u2019s never been about all that other stuff, It\u2019s always been about being able to get up, write, work on stuff, be on stage every night if I can. Once I started getting really famous in Canada I left for a while because I was like, If I enjoy this too much, I\u2019ll get lazy, and then I\u2019m just thinking about not losing what I have, and if you write when you have a lot to lose, I find it\u2019s never gonna be as good as when you write when you have nothing to lose. So I\u2019ll go to a fresh new market where I have nothing to lose and push myself as far as I want, and if it doesn\u2019t work, I can always go home later, you know? The best thing is having that freedom, being able to create the work I want to create.

aVA Florida court has been forced to grapple with what it means to be a friend.\u000a\u000aAt least, on Facebook.\u000a\u000aThe Third District Court of Appeal in Miami denied a petition yesterday to recuse a judge from a case because she was Facebook friends with an attorney for the defendant, as the Miami-Herald first reported. In short, the court said that a Facebook friendship effectively doesn\u2019t mean anything, these days.\u000a\u000aTrue that.\u000a\u000aAs the Court explained in its ruling, this is hardly settled law. In fact, there\u2019s an active legal debate about how important a social media friendship is right now, taking place in legal opinions and ethics guidelines. At the very end of the court\u2019s ruling, it writes, \u201cOn this point we respectfully acknowledge we are in conflict with the opinion of our sister court in Domville.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Domville v. State, a 2012 case which came before Florida\u2019s Fourth District Court of Appeal, in which the court ruled that a judge had to be recused because of a Facebook friendship with a prosecutor.\u000a\u000aThe Third District Court disagreed. Here\u2019s three of the reasons on which it based its decision:\u000a\u000a1. Real world friendship isn\u2019t enough to recuse a judge from a case, so why should fake world friendship do it?\u000a\u000aBack in 1998, Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeals ruled that the mere fact of being a friend of an attorney on a case cannot be sufficient reason to recuse a judge from that case. The legal community is not that large, lawyers have professional associations and social gatherings. Lots of lawyers know lots of judges, and this will only get more intense in smaller communities. If friendship disqualified judges, \u201cthen most judges in rural and semi-rural areas and many in metropolitan areas would be subject to disqualification in a large number of cases,\u201d the first district court wrote.\u000a\u000a2. People have too many friends on Facebook for the connections to really mean anything.\u000a\u000a\u201cFacebook members often cannot recall every person they have accepted as \u2018friends\u2019 or who have accepted them as \u2018friends,'\u201d the court wrote, citing two different cases in which lawyers attempted to make an issue of a Facebook connection. In each case, the social media connection was one among thousands. In one case, a student accused of assaulting another student claimed not to remember being friends with the victim on Facebook.\u000a\u000a3. Facebook is really about networking.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany Facebook \u2018friends\u2019 are selected based upon Facebook\u2019s datamining technology rather than personal interactions,\u201d the court writes. \u201cThe use of data mining and networking algorithms, which are also revolutionizing modern marketing and national security systems, reflects an astounding development in applied mathematics; it constitutes a powerful tool to build personal and professional networks; and it has nothing to do with close or intimate friendships of the sort that would require recusal.\u201d\u000a\u000aBurn.\u000a\u000aWe all know that Facebook is a sort of social network with a LinkedIn knock-off built in. It\u2019s become really boring on Zuckerburg\u2019s digital island, because Facebook makes many different kinds of worlds collide. Which means that a Facebook connection just really doesn\u2019t mean much. The court later describes how \u201ca random name drawn from a list of Facebook \u2018friends'\u201d could really be anyone the person in question ever met (actually, scratch that last part).\u000a\u000aFacebook did not reply to a request for comment on this story, but we all generally understand that Facebook connections have become increasingly vapid. So why do we all keep visiting the site? It\u2019s not clear, but the court concludes saying that Facebook connection just isn\u2019t significant enough to raise issues about a judge\u2019s fairness. It concludes:\u000a\u000aBecause a \u201cfriend\u201d on a social networking website is not necessarily a friend in the traditional sense of the word, we hold that the mere fact that a judge is a Facebook \u201cfriend\u201d with a lawyer for a potential party or witness, without more, does not provide a basis for a well-grounded fear that the judge cannot be impartial or that the judge is under the influence of the Facebook \u201cfriend.\u201d\u000a\u000aJudges in Florida have reason to be wary of social media. A judge in Orlando\u2019s bizarre behavior on social media (a woman appeared before her in a divorce proceeding and the judge added her as a friend while the case was ongoing) led in part to an investigation and her ultimate resignation from the bench.\u000a\u000aStill, cooler heads appear to be prevailing. On Facebook, \u201cfriend\u201d is a term of art, meaning that the meaning changes when used by Facebook from what it means in real life, as the third district court explained in its opinion.\u000a\u000aIn real life, friendship is magic. On Facebook, it doesn\u2019t really mean anything at all.

aVJohnny Depp just sold the fourth of his five penthouses at the Eastern Columbia Building. Scroll through to see the quirky duplex.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLast year, Johnny Depp hoisted his collection of five Los Angeles penthouses onto the sales market. The actor was asking a total of $12.78 million for the condos, which are located in the Eastern Columbia Building.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not one palatial spread, however, as Depp never actually combined the separate units, which he starting buying up in 2002. Instead, he apparently preferred using each as one would use rooms in a home. It\u2019s taken quite some time, but he\u2019s steadily been bidding adieu to the units, at the same time as his financial and legal woes have repeatedly created headlines\u2014like that one time he squandered $5 million, just to shoot Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s ashes out of a cannon.\u000a\u000aBut now he\u2019s parted ways with a fourth penthouse for $1.82 million. The recently sold three-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex spans 1,755 square feet, making it the smallest of the five condos. It might not compare to the entire French village he put on the market last year, but it\u2019s still nice!\u000a\u000aThere are high ceilings and oversized windows throughout the condo, per the listing held by Partners Trust broker Kevin Dees, which is just as wonderfully quirky as you\u2019d expect from the actor.\u000a\u000aThe great room is open to the dining room, and the kitchen is equipped with chrome appliances. A red metal staircase leads to the second level, where the exposed brick-filled master suite is located. Other accents include brightly colored linoleum floors and some rather unique artwork and lighting. The condo also has access to a private terrace, which in turn leads to the building\u2019s \u201csky deck,\u201d complete with a saltwater pool, spa and fitness area.\u000a\u000aThis means there\u2019s only one remaining penthouse left in Depp\u2019s collection\u2014if anyone\u2019s interested, the one-bedroom, two-bathroom condo is currently on the market for $1.79 million, and it contains a wall mural by Brazilian street artist Osgemeos.

aV\u201cI have to tell you my new favorite joke,\u201d Uzo Aduba says. \u201cI literally died laughing at it for half a day. You ready? Why did the chicken cross the road?\u201d\u000a\u000aI mumble something that probably sounds like, \u201cTo get to the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo get to the idiot\u2019s house,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cKnock knock.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chicken.\u201d And with that, Aduba descends into laughter. She insists the joke works better in print, but I\u2019ll contest it works pretty well when it\u2019s delivered by a two-time Emmy winner.\u000a\u000aAduba catapulted into mainstream recognition for her tender portrayal of Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren on Netflix\u2019s hit original series, Orange Is the New Black. In 2014, she won her first Emmy in 2014 for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. A year later, she won a second time\u2014best supporting actress in a drama\u2014making her the only actress to win awards in two different categories for the same role.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to me because I don\u2019t know if I believe we were ever one thing exclusively,\u201d Aduba says, about the Netflix show\u2019s category jumping. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the word is that needs to be created to call it, since we\u2019re so hell-bent as a society to find a category. We\u2019re very invested in placing things in certain boxes, for our own outside comfort, so we can say, \u2018I understand that you are this religion, that you are this gender, that you are this sexual orientation, that you are this sort of director, that this is this sort of show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aFrom its first season, Orange Is the New Black was a show that defied television convention. For one, it was a show that focused almost exclusively on women\u2019s stories, showcasing narratives about power and fear in a world in which male attention was an almost useless currency. It\u2019s also one of the most diverse shows on television\u2014one of the first to showcase a transgender actress portraying a transgender woman, and, as Aduba brings up, one of the only shows that depicts a variety of racial experiences across a number of different races.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs many shows are there are on television that are diverse, now, we still don\u2019t see a lot of television where we see a swath of different characters on a single show,\u201d Aduba says. There\u2019s Orange Is the New Black, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Master of None, Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, \u201cand not many more. We still haven\u2019t rounded that corner. It\u2019s not just enough to have different faces speaking for different groups but different faces all within the same group, speaking to all people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo character in Orange Is the New Black is the \u201ctoken\u201d minority: a character who pops up to offer an opinion on behalf of his or her entire race, whose main purpose in the narrative is offering guidance to the white protagonist and offering comfort to the viewers at home that they aren\u2019t racist.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are people who think this isn\u2019t for them because they\u2019re not a woman, or because they\u2019ve never been to prison, or they see people of color and think it\u2019s not for them. On the side of gender, people are realizing gender has nothing to do with it. You tell an honest story, an honest story lives inside of all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat love of storytelling was what brought Aduba from her path of becoming a classical opera singer to becoming an actress.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn high school, I knew I liked to sing, and my voice happened to sing in a classical fashion, so that seemed like the most sensible thing to do next. But when I went to school, I realized what I loved about singing was the storytelling aspect. Boston College has a classical program, so in the morning I\u2019d be rolling on the floor for movement, and we had to take acting and Shakespeare for the theatrical component, and then the afternoon we did the musical component\u2014musical theory, music history, and I was like, I think I like the rolling on the floor part more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you go into college, you\u2019re in this period in your life where you have so much certainty and uncertainty at the same time. You\u2019re so sure of some things, like, who you think you are and the person you want to be, and then going to school can either cement that for you and confirm, or, for a lot of people, I think it winds up breaking you wide open and making you realize your true identity and that\u2019s what happened with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as she shifted her career goals, Aduba\u2019s classical singing training formed the foundation of what would become her disciplined approach to the craft of acting. \u201cOpera is not something you just get up and do. It takes a discipline, a study, a vocal dexterity that is achieved through the exercise of the voice, and I think that\u2019s applicable to acting. I think how I approach my acting is not just to wake up and do it, although there are some things that can be found in just waking up and doing things, but if I\u2019m working on material, to really study it, and really get inside the head and the psychology of that individual and the world in which he or she inhabits. I had this amazing teacher in college who said, \u2018Anyone can sing pretty, but what are you trying to say?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so what has Aduba been trying to say with the character of Suzanne, who entered the series as comic relief, Piper\u2019s unrequited lover and who, over the course of four seasons, has become one of television\u2019s most heartbreakingly tragic figures, manipulated by those around her and desperate to be seen?\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody deserves love,\u201d Aduba says without hesitation.\u000a\u000aSuzanne Warren is just one of the many characters Orange Is the New Black has developed and enriched over the span of its four seasons. It\u2019s not character growth so much as character deepening, like seeing a two-dimensional shape and then walking around and realizing it was a three-dimensional sculpture all along. Through flashbacks, Orange Is the New Black peels back the khaki uniform and allows us to see prisoners\u2014so often dismissed in red-wine swirling living room political discussions as a monolith\u2014as individuals, each sheltering their own stories.\u000a\u000aAlthough its category at the Emmys has transferred from comedy to drama, that seems something of an arbitrary judgment call and not a shift in the show itself. The first season did have sad-sack Larry, Piper\u2019s infuriating milquetoast liberal stereotype of a fiancé, but it still looked unflinchingly at drug abuse, the struggles of being transgender, the cruel caprices of the corrections officers and the day-to-day Kafkaesque nightmare that is American incarceration.\u000a\u000aThe later seasons didn\u2019t have Larry (thank god), but it focused on the same issues, still unflinching, even as they brought us to their heightened, tragic breaking point.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the first season, Season 4, where I have not watched the end,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cWhen the season came out, that experience was still very emotionally alive for me and I didn\u2019t want to have that experience right then again, because I remember, very clearly, second for second, what each of those last three episodes felt like\u2014and that feeling was so visceral, still, a year and however long away from it, and I was like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to watch that. I still haven\u2019t watched it. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be ready. Or if I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most difficult aspect of watching Orange Is the New Black might be the realization that it could be any one of us behind bars, without rights and seemingly without oversight, even if you think you\u2019re the type of person who would never, ever go to prison. While that lesson might have been most obvious right away with Piper, the privileged upper-middle-class blonde who got caught up 10 years ago with a drug-smuggling lover, it\u2019s true of almost every single character in the series.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood people can make mistakes,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cSetting it a min security prison, you realize with most of these characters, how they got there was a minor infection\u2014slipped on a banana peel and did something that they happened to get caught for it and you didn\u2019t. And I think that does a great way of humanizing these characters because they\u2019re not so far out of reach for most people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Aduba, she\u2019s grateful for the chance to be a part of it, to get to tell a good, honest story. \u201cThis is a gift, to get to do what I want to do. I can still remember waiting in lines, whether it was for an audition before I was union, and having to wait outside the union line, waiting for all of the union people to audition and then they would let the union people in, to stuffing envelopes, to stuffing envelopes with headshots and writing letters with my resume and dropping them off all over this city.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd now, this city is where Aduba is putting down roots. As she came to the interview, she was just finalizing buying a house to live in with her dog, Mr. Fenway Bark. \u201cI\u2019m just really happy,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cI\u2019m like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into The Woods lyric, \u2018Excited and scared.\u2019 That\u2019s what I am.\u201d

aVYour arrows are nocked, your Valyrian steel sharpened and your dragonglass forged\u2026you, my friend, are ready for the Season 7 finale of Game of Thrones. Congratulations on making it this far; we sure have been through a lot together this year. Daenerys finally invading Westeros, Jorah finding a cure for his greyscale, the Starks reuniting. We even made it through one of the most illogical episodes of television of all time. Just one question remains: What happens now?\u000a\u000aThe Season 7 finale of Game of Thrones is upon us, and we have a few predictions.\u000a\u000a1. An Uneasy Alliance\u000a\u000aIn the teaser above, we finally get to see the majority of main characters meet up in a cease fire negotiation. Visible in those quick shots are (deep breath): Jon Snow, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Varys, Davos, Podrick, Brienne of Tarth, Jorah Mormont, Theon Greyjoy and Missandei (Dany is presumably en route atop of Drogon). The goal of the good guys here is to convince Cersei that the Night King and army of the dead exist and to work out an armistice so they can join forces and fight together.\u000a\u000aAn uneasy alliance will be struck between the competing factions but not before something tragic happens. An attack or betrayal of some sort is bound to take place at this meeting whether at the hands of Cersei or even the Night King (who can swoop down on his fancy new Ice Dragon). The loss of fan favorite main characters will prompt whatever agreement the major players reach.\u000a\u000aMost likely characters to be killed in descending order of male genitalia possession: Theon, Varys, Brienne, Cersei and (hot take) Tyrion. Then again, this is a George R.R. Martin story we\u2019re talking about, so everyone we like could be killed.\u000a\u000a2. A Song of Ice and Fire\u000a\u000aThe 79-minute, 43-second finale is titled \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf.\u201d This suggests two possibilities:\u000a\u000aDaenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow finally consummate all of those lingering gazes. Why no one in either camp has suggested a marriage alliance as a practical consolidation of power in this ongoing war effort is beyond us, but these two are hooking up sooner rather than later. Long live the Starkgaryens.\u000a\u000aJon\u2019s true parentage may finally be revealed to him. This could happen through Bran and his visions (Tourney at Harrenhall flashback, perhaps?), Sam Tarly\u2019s (read: Gilly\u2019s) research or a surprise appearance from Howland Reed, Meera\u2019s father and the only living witness to Jon\u2019s birth at the Tower of Joy.\u000a\u000aOr, both things could happen, in which case we would pop open some Dornish wine, snack on some Hot Pie wolf cakes and celebrate.\u000a\u000a3. Arya and Sansa Patch Things Up Over Some Casual Murder\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve spoken at length at how ridiculous the tension between the two Stark sisters is, so now is as good of a time as any to settle it. Let\u2019s say Bran doesn\u2019t reveal the truth to Jon just yet, the showrunners will have to give him something else to do for the finale. For seven seasons, his character has served zero practical use to the actual story and all he\u2019s been good for are information dumps for the audience.\u000a\u000aFingers crossed that Bran finally feels like making himself useful by showing both Arya and Sansa how Littlefinger has betrayed their family over the years. This will, of course, lead to Arya sticking that shiny Valyrian dagger Littlefinger gave Bran into his stomach. Bye bye Baelish.\u000a\u000a(Side Note: anyone who thinks Bran is the Night King truly knows nothing).\u000a\u000a4. New Ratings Record\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t exactly a bold prediction, but it\u2019s a likely outcome. This season of Game of Thrones has been breaking viewership records despite all of the episode leaks. Expect the series-high 10.7 million live plus same day viewer mark to be broken on Sunday.

aVUnless you\u2019re a dedicated theater buff or live in the proximity of Broadway, Harold Prince might not be a household name. But, if you have been an audience fixture at any of the more than 32 history-making productions he\u2019s directed or produced over the past seven decades in the kingdom known as the Broadway stage, you know that Harold Prince (call him \u201cHal,\u201d everyone at Sardi\u2019s does) sits on the throne and wears the crown. His rule has won him 21 Tony awards but now, in a dazzling new musical that just opened in the unheard-of middle of summer, Prince Hal is finally being honored for the entire body of his work, career and life. It\u2019s a joyous tribute called Prince of Broadway, and the people who make up titles aren\u2019t kidding. This is noblesse oblige with a whole new meaning. See it and cheer.\u000a\u000aHonoring a man whose achievements include everything from The Pajama Game to Phantom of the Opera (the longest-running musical in Broadway history, and still running) is not as easy as you think. What do you leave out? Starting his career in show business working for nothing as George Abbott\u2019s office boy, then moving into a job working for nothing as an assistant stage manager until he learned the ropes at the hands of the masters, you could say Mr. Prince worked his way up. There were more hits and flops on his resume than anyone else since David Merrick. Prince of Broadway does its level best to salute them all. The result is an extravaganza nearly three hours long, in which you are entertained to dizzying heights.\u000a\u000aThe concept is simple. A superb cast of seven seasoned pros takes turns portraying the boss with trademark glasses perched on top of his balding noggin, offering observations and sage advice about luck, preparedness, passion and how to succeed by really, really trying. Between musical numbers, you learn what it felt like in fallow periods (8 flops in a row), why he doesn\u2019t direct revivals (how do you improve on something tantamount to perfection the first time around?), and what it feels like to wake up the morning after a hit to rave reviews (he starts his next project before reality sets in). To the credit of all and sundry, the talk is minimal and it never gets cloying. Nor does the overcrowded program ever sink to the level of a concert. With the celebrated director Susan Stroman, Prince has collated diverse production numbers from a rich history of career highlights, pulling out every stop. Beowulf Boritt\u2019s beautiful sets provide extraordinary backdrops for condensed versions of the original settings for every show. Lavish costumes by William Ivey Long and rich orchestrations conducted by Jason Robert Brown enhance a scrapbook compilation of what you could call \u201cHal Prince\u2019s Greatest Hits\u201d. Every number becomes a complete show unto itself, but before you can fully appreciate the brilliant efforts to recreate the feelings and moods of the original shows, the pace moves with such clockwork that you are onto the next number before the applause dies down.\u000a\u000aThe result is a multitude of small shows within a central frame that results in a night of ceaseless charms and challenges. Highlights include Tony Yazbeck\u2019s muscular dancing on \u201cThe Right Girl\u201d from the fabulous score for Mr. Prince\u2019s personal favorite, Follies, and seasoned veteran Karen Ziemba, surpassing everything she has ever done onstage with her rolling pin, stretching out the filthy dough for the \u201cWorst Pies in London\u201d as a mendacious Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Sweeney Todd. Then there beady-eyed Brandon Uranowitz spewing decadence as the Joel Grey-inspired emcee in Cabaret; the powerful baritone of Chuck Cooper plumbing the inner tragedy of \u201cOl\u2019 Man River\u201d from deep within; handsome Michael Xavier, fresh from co-starring with Glenn Close in the revival of Sunset Boulevard, conjuring laughs as clumsy Clark Kent in his fruity Superman costume in the ill-fated It\u2019s a Bird\u2026It\u2019s a Plane\u2026It\u2019s Superman, then breaking hearts with Sondheim\u2019s \u201cBeing Alive\u201d from Company. And of course, there\u2019s the always awesome Emily Skinner, who gets some of the best material including \u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch\u201d (Company) and \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d (A Little Night Music). She stops the show every time she opens her mouth. One caveat: why nothing from one of my favorite Hal Prince shows, the innovative and spectacular Pacific Overtures? Oh, well. As I said before, with this much greatness to choose from, the secondary concern after what to include is the problem of what to leave out.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s much, much more, but with too much praise and too little space, I know when I\u2019m licked. Just forget about passing this one by, and make plans accordingly. This is as good as polished, professional theater ever gets. Did somebody say \u201cPrince\u201d of Broadway? Harold Prince is the \u201cKing\u201d, and don\u2019t you forget it.

aVTaylor Swift released the first single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d of her new album Reputation on Friday and it has the Internet pretty divided.\u000a\u000aThe album is set to hit store shelves (or, you know, iTunes because this is 2017) on November 10. Since her debut album in 2006, Swift has released a new record every two years. However, it\u2019s been three years since the smash pop hit 1989 and fans are desperate for T-Swizzle originals. Unfortunately, she was probably hoping for a more universally welcoming response.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t like your little games/Like your tilted stage,\u201d the pop star sings. \u201cThe role you make me play, the fool/No, I don\u2019t like you.\u201d Everyone has been speculating who the track is aimed at.

aVAlison Wright makes one hell of a first impression. \u201cI\u2019m dying right now,\u201d the actress says mere moments after we meet, laughing and draping a blanket over her shoulders nearly as thick as her Sunderland accent. The situation is understandable, though. We sit down to talk in the back of a Brooklyn photography studio less than 24 hours after Wright made her Broadway debut in Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat, not to mention on the same Sunday the actress returns to TV in Feud: Bette and Joan, from reigning king of the anthology series, Ryan Murphy. It\u2019s an impressive, back-to-back series of accomplishments\u2014especially from someone introduced to American audiences just four years ago on The Americans\u2014that demands a celebration late into the night, early morning interview be damned.\u000a\u000aWell, early afternoon interview.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, though, if this is talking to Wright while she\u2019s dying, I\u2019d love to meet her living. The Lee Strasberg Institute graduate smiles easy and often; she answers questions with a stage performer\u2019s poise mingled with a charisma made for cameras. She\u2019s whip quick, too. At one point, to demonstrate her preparation for the 1961-set Feud, Wright seamlessly adopts an old-school American accent. \u201cWell, good morning, Ms. Crawford,\u201d she says, in a voice you might have heard echoing from Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre in an era when most of the handprints out front were still drying. Wright calls it \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood sound,\u201d and you recognize it immediately even without being able to describe how.\u000a\u000aIt is exactly \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood\u201d\u2014for better, but often for worse\u2014which Feud concerns itself with. The eight-episode anthology series chronicles the behind-the-scenes conflict of 1962 thriller Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which starred veritable screen legends and perennial rivals Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon). Come for the Hollywood Sign-sized drama\u2014bask in the shade, if you will\u2014but stay for a dive far deeper than the surface scratched by a cat-fight, a look at a film machine built by men, for men and the women it used, abused and spit out the moment the lens caught a wrinkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe knows the only time you pay attention to a woman is when she\u2019s in front of a camera,\u201d Wright, as assistant Pauline Jameson, tells Baby Jane director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in Feud\u2019s first episode. The \u201cshe,\u201d in this case, just happens to be one of Aldrich\u2019s many par-for-the-course affairs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intention was never just to make campy, kitschy fun,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how difficult it was for these women in the last 10, 15 years of their lives, at a time when their male counterparts were just beginning, and becoming more distinguished. Their life supply was cut off, really, for both of them, because they turned 50 years old.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Pauline, Wright has the unique task of portraying one of the few Feud roles to not exist in real life. Instead, Pauline operates as an amalgam of the show\u2019s more pressing themes. The assistants who should have been studio heads. The authoritative voices drowned out by the clacking of a secretary\u2019s typewriter. The woman who, quite literally, picked Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? from a pile of ideas and handed it off to a man.\u000a\u000a\u201cPauline is a composite of all the women who worked in the studio systems,\u201d Wright says. \u201cMy character represents a lot of these women who were very great and capable at their job, at a time everyone expected your endgame to be marriage and kids. Pauline wants to be a director. She wants a future in the business.\u201d\u000a\u000aWright\u2019s preparation went beyond adopting an accent; she adopted a mindset. \u201cWhat would it feel like if marriage and kids were not your endgame plan? Because it definitely isn\u2019t for Pauline. Back then, that made you unusual already, right there.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt always blows me away that, in this country, a woman couldn\u2019t have a credit card without her husband until 1974,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cI\u2019d just think about all these things where you would never believe that was actually the case until you actually find out that it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich is where Feud takes on an eerie undertone more akin to Murphy\u2019s other anthology series, where it becomes something of an actual American horror story, where you notice the trials and tribulations of that old Hollywood don\u2019t seem too different than those of that new Hollywood.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Wright says, eyes flashing. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. That it\u2019s not any different. Ryan is looking at, well, how far have things actually progressed in these 50, 60 years?\u201d\u000a\u000aBEGIN FLASHBACK:\u000a\u000aINT. 89TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS \u2013 EVENING\u000a\u000aActress BRIE LARSON refuses to applaud onstage as CASEY AFFLECK accepts his Best Actor win amid allegations of sexual assault. MEL GIBSON (choice dialogue: \u201cYou look like a fucking pig in heat,\u201d in reference to ex-wife Oksana Grigorieva) sits in the audience, smiling.\u000a\u000aEND FLASHBACK\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cSo I know exactly how it is to be a woman and move through the world. So this shit,\u201d referring to Feud, to Baby Jane, to Hollywood, to everything, \u201cit still applies.\u201d\u000a\u000aI ask Wright what first step needs to be taken toward a more inclusive Hollywood, and she tells me that step has already been taken\u2014by none other than Ryan Murphy himself. In early 2016, the uber-producer introduced the Half foundation to his Ryan Murphy Productions, an initiative that promised to fill at least 50 percent of his various shows\u2019 director slots with women. True to his word, Feud\u2019s eight-episode run sees two episodes helmed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton (American Horror Story, The Americans), another from Liza Johnson (Good Girls Revolt) and a penultimate chapter overseen by Oscar-winning actress turned director, Helen Hunt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are more women on Ryan\u2019s set than I have ever seen, anywhere,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cThere was a woman behind each camera. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Wright\u2014who came to the States 19 years ago and has lived and worked here ever since\u2014the shocking part of this conversation is the fact it\u2019s still a conversation at all. \u201cWomen are half of society, you know?\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the people who are making decisions, or making the content, are all just white guys in their 50s, that\u2019s the only perspective you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is, undoubtedly, a continuous uphill climb. The world did not change after it found out what happened to Baby Jane. This is the same Hollywood in which Sally Fields played Tom Hanks\u2019 mother in Forrest Gump, just six years after playing his love interest in 1988\u2019s Punchline. In which Feud\u2019s own Susan Sarandon (then 67) was old enough to play a 43-year-old Melissa McCarthy\u2019s grandmother in 2014\u2019s Tammy. In which the Hollywood-commanding, billion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe\u201415 films so far and seemingly continuing on into infinity\u2014has yet to use a single female director.\u000a\u000a\u2018Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If [women are] not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cStep one, we just need to get more women onto sets,\u201d Wright says. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is by going out of your way to demand that\u2019s what you want. The studios will bring Ryan, or whoever the director is, a selection of people to choose from. But if there\u2019s no women in that group . . .\u201d\u000a\u000aIf I absolutely had to guess, I\u2019d say the deep sigh that follows has nothing to do with last night\u2019s festivities. But after a moment, unsurprisingly, she is composed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut then, Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If we\u2019re not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u201d\u000a\u000aCase in point: The time, quite recently, a reality TV star caught on tape detailing his desire to grab a woman \u201cby the pussy\u201d was elected president of the United States. An occurrence that, as fate would have it, landed directly during the production of Feud.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course the election happened right in between shooting,\u201d Wright remembers. \u201cWe all thought it was going to be a certain way. We thought Hillary Clinton was going to be our president. We were going to have a girl in charge. And then it was like, \u2018Oh, no, no, we\u2019re still a very sexist, misogynist country. Let\u2019s not forget that we haven\u2019t traveled that far.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSomething key to note: Throughout our conversation, Wright refrains from mentioning the president by name; she says, simply, \u201ca certain man.\u201d The time before January 20 is \u201cpre-him.\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of this, she says, is to avoid \u201cgiving him his time.\u201d But mostly, it\u2019s a way to separate her work, her art, from burdening politics. Especially Nottage\u2019s Sweat, a play that, on the surface, is a clear-cut mirror of the modern political scene. Set in the industrial town of Reading, Pennsylvania, Sweat focuses on the post-war decline of the working class, of prosperity giving way to uncertainty. Wright plays Jessie, a woman hit hard by sudden unemployment, and harder by the alcohol she uses to forget it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t always get to be a part of something that\u2019s actually important in terms of society and where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d says Wright, the only new cast member added after the play\u2019s Off-Broadway transfer. \u201cBut this is timely, and it\u2019s actually an important piece of art in terms of reflecting back the state of our society at the moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sweat, which Nottage wrote after extensive interviews between 2001 and 2008 with old factory town workers, \u201cis not about the man who is president.\u201d Wright is adamant. \u201cIt\u2019s about the state of the American working class.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s interesting, though, the projects and roles Wright continues to find herself in\u2014Feud, Sweat, The Americans, this interview itself\u2014that require a deeper look than a first glance. That are far, far more than a first impression. It\u2019s the reason Wright\u2019s Martha on The Americans\u2014who began as near-comic relief and ended her run as the epitome of quiet strength\u2014reminds me of Feud\u2019s Pauline Jameson, despite the years and genres between them.\u000a\u000aWright nods at the comparison. \u201cWell, neither of them are the first two women to be underestimated.\u201d And, despite it all, she grins. \u201cOr the last.\u201d

aVIn December 2007, James Devine, a Union County political operative/newspaper publisher, was arrested for owing $20,000 in child support and alimony.\u000a\u000aIt was the latest fall from grace for Devine, a former Union County Democratic insider. Devine had been, as recently as a few years ago, a somewhat important operative in local political circles, running three weekly newspapers in Union County that depended heavily on financing from county advertisements and legal notices. But when that revenue stream abruptly ended, Devine was out of business and out of luck \u2013 a turn of events he blames on Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, a former political ally who he had a falling out with in the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aNow he\u2019s working to beat Bollwage, who is seeking re-election in the June 3 Democratic primary.\u000a\u000aBut Devine\u2019s detractors hold nothing but venom for a man they characterize as a charlatan who has mucked up the political scene in Union County for decades, and who recently had his bank account frozen for owing tens of thousands in back taxes \u2013 something Devine blames on bad legal advice and child support payments.\u000a\u000aSome public officials who are used to choosing their words carefully don\u2019t hesitate to go on the record slamming Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a sleaze ball, the worst in politics,\u201d said Democratic State Chairman Joseph Cryan, who also represents Union County in the State Assembly. \u201cIf they pay him anything, I hope he used it towards his child support.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter helping political newcomer Wilda Diaz topple eighteen-year incumbent Mayor Joseph Vas in Perth Amboy, Devine has set his sights on ousting Bollwage, who\u2019s held the office since 1993.\u000a\u000aDevine is helping run the campaigns of a slate of four candidates against Bollwage and three at-large council members: Edward Jackus, Frank Cuesta and Patricia Perkins-Auguste. The team is led by political neophyte Edward Bryant Koon, a juvenile detention officer. Running for council-at-large on Koon\u2019s slate are Board of Education President Armando Da Silva; George O\u2019Grady, the board of education\u2019s community-attendance liaison; and former councilman Samuel Rodriguez, who ran for mayor in 1988.\u000a\u000a\u201cI regret the mistakes that I made. I am sorry for them and I hope to make good,\u201d said Devine. \u201cI plan to straighten things out. I didn\u2019t file tax returns for several years. Why? Because I had no idea what my financial picture was. I don\u2019t have enough money to hire accountants to untangle the web that the courts and politicians have conspired against me with.\u201d\u000a\u000aDevine\u2019s feud with Bollwage goes back to 1991, when Devine challenged then-Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn for his Assembly seat. Bollwage, Devine said, never came through with promised support for that campaign, and a year later \u2013 after Bollwage won his first term as mayor \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t support Devine for the 5th ward council seat.\u000a\u000aThe three community newspapers that Devine later picked up \u2014 The News Record and The Patriot \u2014 had essentially been mouthpieces Democratic Establishment in Union County (he also ran the The Adams Tabloid & Citizen Gazette in Middlesex). But after running some critical stories of Bollwage, Devine said, the mayor conspired with Union County Democratic Chairwoman Charlotte DeFilippo and State Sen. Raymond Lesniak to take away the county\u2019s business.\u000a\u000aDevine admitted that the papers leaned towards favoring his clients, but said that it\u2019s typical of small community papers.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore my eyes had been open, I probably was more sympathetic towards the government in Union County,\u201d said Devine. \u201cMy papers were a lot smaller than The Star-Ledger or any other paper that might make claims of journalistic integrity and objectivity, but these were probably no different than any other weekly papers in the state. Clearly there will be a difference when there\u2019s an iron wall between people who do advertising and editorial. In weekly newspapers it\u2019s the same guy, and it\u2019s the same guy who makes corporate decisions and takes out the garbage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy 2006, Devine unloaded the papers. Broke and beaten down from a divorce and car accident, he ultimately found himself missing child support payments, which he traces back to his papers\u2019 ruin.\u000a\u000aLesniak, for his part, denies Devine\u2019s claims of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat never happened. The county was, quite frankly, looking for ways to cut taxes, and that was an extra expense that wasn\u2019t really required,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there was a dispute as to whether he was charging the correct amount for the ads. He lost the Rahway ads as a result of that if I\u2019m not mistaken. I was very resentful of that because he was overcharging for the type sizes. So it was a combination: a dispute over his fees and looking to cut costs, and he took it personally.\u201d\u000a\u000aKoon, for his part, said that Bollwage doesn\u2019t acknowledge a gang problem that plagues the city, and has made crime and property taxes the top issue of his campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that our city needs a change,\u201d said Koon. \u201cTaxes have increased , we have serious gang problem and crime going on in our community, and I believe City Hall should make an effort to deal with crime. Instead of sitting back and doing nothing I\u2018ve decided to run for mayor.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the stronger denunciations of Bollwage come from Devine. The city has lost its well-paying manufacturing jobs, replaced by low wage part-time employers who don\u2019t provide benefits, he said. Bollwage ushered in a wave of development during his four terms as mayor and ten years on the council, like the Ikea just off the Turnpike and the Jersey Gardens Mall.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no Wal-Mart in Elizabeth, but Chris Bollwage did Wal-Mart Elizabeth,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aDevine sees a similarity between Bollwage\u2019s tenure as mayor and Vas in nearby Perth Amboy. They\u2019ve both been in office since the early 1990\u2019s, both remain personally popular, but may be vulnerable to a nationwide mood for change and complaints about tax increases.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople know the mayor and like him, but nobody should be mayor for 20 years,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aLesniak disputes similarities between Bollwage and Vas. First off, unlike Vas, Bollwage never canceled a Puerto Rican Day Parade \u2013 something that put Vas at odds with his city\u2019s large Latino community. Moreover, unlike Diaz, Koon has little name recognition.\u000a\u000a\u201cMayor Vas had a credible opponent. Nobody knows Mayor Bollwage\u2019s opponent,\u201d said Lesniak.\u000a\u000aWhile some local politicos cast doubt on just how integral a role Devine played in the Perth Amboy upset, Diaz said that he did indeed help.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought that he did really well with us,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aBollwage defended his accomplishments as mayor, but refused to address anything having to do with Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on him in any way shape or form. I\u2019m not going to comment on anything he has to say or do. He\u2019s not a candidate,\u201d said Bollwage. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on why political consultants do things. I always think it\u2019s because they\u2019re getting paid.\u201d\u000a\u000aBollwage dismisses his challenge as another aspect of the historically tense relationship between the city\u2019s school board and mayor\u2019s office, which began with Mayor Dunn\u2019s opposition to an elected school board. He argued that Koon was fielded to run for mayor because of an old association with the Superintendent of schools, and that two of Koon\u2019s running mates are affiliated with the school board.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019d like to show me out and run the whole show,\u201d said Bollwage.\u000a\u000aBollwage also says he has not ignored the city\u2019s crime problem, arguing that he\u2019s presided over the institution of after-school programs, expansion of the D.A.R.E. program and is working with prosecutors to make them a frequent presence at community meetings.\u000a\u000aHe points out that he can\u2019t be blamed for the city\u2019s loss of well-paying jobs, a condition far from unique to old industrial cities. Instead, he points to an unemployment rate that was somewhere between 11 and 12% at the beginning of his term, and stood at only 6.4% as of last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting that they would blame me for bringing in jobs. I find that a novel political argument,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blue collar jobs already left the community when I became mayor, so my choices were how to put people in the city of Elizabeth to work. What we did was take advantage of our location near Newark airport and other transportation, created a service economy where people that live here will have access to work and employment.\u201d

aVIf you are standing right now, I suggest you sit down, because we\u2019re going to begin with some truly shocking news: Aubrey Plaza is not a 50-year-old man.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, this should be clear to anyone who has followed Plaza on her rise to stardom over the years\u2014the seven seasons portraying the human embodiment of an eye-roll, April Ludgate, on NBC\u2019s Parks & Recreation, her quieter standout roles in indies like Safety Not Guaranteed and Ned Rifle, or more recent big-screen endeavors like Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Certainly, it\u2019s clear to me, sitting across from the actress at a Los Feliz noodle bar, a month before she\u2019s set to co-star in Legion, FX\u2019s Marvel-universe mind-bender from Fargo creator Noah Hawley.\u000a\u000aBut is it clear to Hawley? Harder to say. In the original pilot script for Legion, Hawley wrote the character of Lenny Busker as a male, middle-aged former drug-addict, the resident, older sage of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, providing both optimism and advice to our mutant main character David Haller (Dan Stevens). The question becomes, What made the writer-director, after a single meeting with Plaza, decide the 32-year-old actress would be a perfect fit for the part?\u000a\u000a\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she says and laughs, before changing tact. \u201cI mean, no, I get it. I think that maybe that\u2019s my real, underneath persona, and at heart, I\u2019m like a 50-year-old drug addict living in a mental hospital. And Noah saw that\u2019s who I am, really, underneath it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a typical answer from Plaza. You often don\u2019t realize she\u2019s joking until halfway through a sentence, and by then it turns into a game of catch-up with an Upright Citizens Brigade veteran. But it\u2019s not a cold-shoulder thing, either, not a heightened social awkwardness. Despite what every interview with the actress written between 2009 and 2015 would have you believe, she\u2019s not actually April Ludgate. The first order of business she suggests after sitting down is that we take a C-Shot together. Despite having no idea what a C-Shot is, I agree. \u201cGreat, let\u2019s just go crazy,\u201d she replies, stone-faced.\u000a\u000a\u201cCrazy,\u201d as it turns out, is an apropos way to begin any conversation over Legion. Any viewer expecting the formulaic blueprint of your typical Marvel blockbuster\u2014the family tragedy, the unwilling hero, the British thespian hamming it up as the villain, etcetera, etcetera\u2014is likely to come away disappointed or, at least, plenty confused.\u000a\u000aThe character of David Haller has been around in paper-and-ink form since 1985 when writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz brought him to life in New Mutants #25. The son of chrome-domed psychic Charles Xavier (a spoiler for the comics but not, as far as I know, the show), Haller is the human equivalent of an overbooked hotel; his mutant ability is essentially a heightened form of dissociative identity disorder, formerly known by its cruder term \u201csplit personality,\u201d with each unique persona adding to a deafening cacophony of separate abilities.\u000a\u000aWith Legion, Hawley has taken this idea\u2014what if you were several \u201cyous\u201d somehow simultaneously\u2014and translated it to the small screen in a way that is not only immersive and exciting but, at times, overwhelmingly confusing. Characters jump timelines and swap bodies. Reality often shifts, without warning, or gives way completely to another layer underneath, and on at least one occasion, that layer is a synchronized dance number. To wit, Legion is weird\u2014and unlike anything Marvel has done before.\u000a\u000aAnd through it all\u2014the confusion, complexity and chaos\u2014the one constant remains Plaza\u2019s blood-shot Lenny Busker. \u201cMy goal was for Lenny to be the happy place for David, at all times,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaving that to focus on, with all that other bad stuff lingering in the background for me, was a good combination. It helped me play the character as someone fighting against the bad stuff and allowed it to be more than just, \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m so crazy. I\u2019m like, totally tweaking out.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat border, between comic-book storytelling and the reality of mental illness, is where Legion walks its finest line. After all, the series\u2019 main thesis, spouted from inside a psychiatric hospital, is that occasionally the illness is your strength, and more dangerously, the voices in your head might be telling some form of truth. In a scene from the pilot, David, Lenny and newcomer Syd (Rachel Keller) sit in support group, while a doctor grills them on their respective problems. \u201cWhat if your problems are in your head?\u201d Syd asks. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not even problems?\u201d\u000a\u000aLenny, who until then is too busy grooving to oversized headphones to participate, leans forward. \u201cI like you,\u201d she says, eyes wide. \u201cYou got what the kids these days call \u2018moxie.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI liked the idea, and I think Noah really likes the idea, of having Lenny be this optimist despite the challenges she\u2019s facing,\u201d Plaza tells me. \u201cYou have this character in a mental hospital. She\u2019s a drug addict. She pretty much has everything possible going wrong for her. But she\u2019s the one making jokes, to cheer David up, to be the bright light in it all. That was interesting to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith that, our C-Shots arrived, a mixture of cayenne pepper and lemon that, very much like Legion, is simultaneously refreshing and hard to swallow. We drink. I cough. She does not.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s entirely plausible that the reason Hawley saw Lenny Busker as fluid is Plaza herself, as a character actress, is nearly impossible to typecast down. Every move post-Parks, even across from Robert De Niro in the critically maligned yet financially successful Dirty Grandpa, has looked like a move away from an April Ludgate-shaped trap, marked with that dreaded qualifier, \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This, Plaza tells me, is deliberate. \u201cThere was definitely a time where people couldn\u2019t see beyond April Ludgate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in playing all different types of parts, and getting those parts are hard when people put you in a box.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwo Plaza-starring features debuted at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, as different as they were successful. The first, Ingrid Goes West, is part social media satire, part twisted road-trip film. Plaza, who also served as producer, plays Ingrid, an Instagram-obsessive who moves across the country to befriend social-celebrity Ingrid Sloane (played by Marvel peer Elizabeth Olsen, of Avengers fame). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a social media commentary, but it\u2019s not really about that,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about human relationships, and human connections, and how some people have a really hard time making them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA phenomenon, to prove there is no limit to art imitating life, that Plaza knows all too well. A few days prior to our conversation, the actress deleted her Twitter account (@EvilHag, of course), an act nearly blasphemous in the age of instant information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a long time coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like it made sense to do it right before the new year started, some kind of lame way of saying, \u2018Fuck it, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019 I realized that it was adding nothing positive to my life. It was unhealthy. It just bummed me out, honestly.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza\u2019s second Sundance offering is, well, a little harder to explain, 140 characters or not, even for the actress herself. The Little Hours, Plaza\u2019s third collaboration with writer-director Jeff Baena, has so many conflicting personalities it could star in Legion. At once a faithful adaptation of 14th-Century novella collection The Decameron and a raunchy comedy, the film sees Plaza playing a nun but not really, she warns, without further explanation. But yes, a nun (kind of), forced to live in a convent in the age of the Bubonic Plague. \u201cIt\u2019s almost academic. I think colleges would show it to explain that time period,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIf, you know, it wasn\u2019t so fucked up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with starring beside the likes of John C. Reilly, Alison Brie and Dave Franco, Plaza was put on prayer duty; that is to say, Baena asked the Catholic born-and-raised actress to ensure The Little Hours\u2019 dialogue, in between the countless \u201cfucks,\u201d was as Biblically accurate as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was kind of funny because I was working on Legion, which is a very different thing, a very dark thing,\u201d Plaza remembers, \u201cand I kept switching from that to literally reading the Bible at night. I, like, stole the Bible from my hotel room.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd as she reads, she remembers: memories, she tells me, of a childhood in a Catholic home, of leading mass as cantor, of Bible study and even of her very first paying job working the front desk of a convent attached to her all-girls high school. \u201cI just sat there and answered phone calls, mainly from the shoe cobbler who would have the nuns\u2019 shoes nice and cobbled.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing really crazy happened. I wish I had a scandalous nun story for you,\u201d she continues. I point out the cosmic irony of, decades later, playing a nun herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Plaza smiles. A few weeks later, reviews pour out of Sundance for The Little Hours, focusing primarily on sacramental wine chugging, chastity-vow breaking and a particular scene in which Plaza pelts a man with radishes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make them all so proud.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza began her 2017 with a dance. As the clock struck midnight on December 31, the actress, her Twitter deleted, Legion set to debut in two months, had a single resolution. \u201cMy goal was to start a legit dance party,\u201d she tells me.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had a massive New Year\u2019s Eve party at my house, about 200 people,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe packed it in. There was one point, right before midnight, there were so many people there you couldn\u2019t move. It was a fire hazard. And I wanted to get everyone to a dance floor.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza keeps herself busy with work\u2014\u201cI only act,\u201d she tells me, a statement that remains true well into 2017\u2014and doesn\u2019t really do New Year\u2019s Resolutions, or, at least, can think of none off the top of her head. Which makes this single objective, in the middle of a packed house, a unique one.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were playing all of the songs you want to hear\u2014Bowie, Prince, George Michael\u2014we were trying to do a whole, \u2018Can you fucking believe what happened in 2016?\u2019 playlist. But then I just was like, We gotta get some Chance the Rapper and start getting down and dirty with it. I felt there was kind of an energy to that party where everyone was just like, \u2018Ugh, I want to dance off 2016, get it out and start over.\u2019 That\u2019s all I wanted, and it happened, right after midnight.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was,\u201d she continues, \u201cwhat the kids these days call \u2018a rager.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aListening back over the interview audio later, things clicked into place right there, mostly, I imagine, because Plaza borrowed a phrase from her own character, Lenny Busker, the aforementioned \u201cwhat the kids these days call\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aNot to presume I understand Noah Hawley\u2014there are still parts of Legion I couldn\u2019t describe, even on a good day\u2014but on one particular point, I could attempt a guess. What did he see in Plaza, in one meeting, that made her the perfect fit for Lenny Busker? Let her tell you a story over one interview, over one meeting, and the matter of gender and age fall away; instead, you see there is no difference, really, between the woman who looked at a year of darkness, death and uncertainty and thought first of a dance-floor, and Lenny Busker, the eternal optimist in oversized headphones, lighting the way through the mental asylum.

aVAnother day, another priceless relic of history caught in the crossfire of snap-happy tourists. This week, a family visiting the museum at Prittlewell Priory museum in Britain\u2019s Southend-on-Sea damaged an 800-year-old coffin, which is believed to have once held the remains of an important monk, while attempting to take a photo of their child inside the artifact, reports the New York Times.\u000a\u000aThe Southend-on-Sea Borough Council posted before and after images of the sandstone coffin on its Tumblr, along with an announcement that the object will be be sent to undergo repairs, which are estimated cost of £100 (approx. $130).\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, August 20 a family visiting the museum placed their child inside the coffin for a photograph, damaging the item in the process. The event was captured, although not clearly, on the museum\u2019s CCTV cameras. However, the family left without reporting the damage, according to the Times.\u000a\u000aAnn Holland, Southend-on-Sea\u2019s executive councillor for culture, said in a statement that the coffin, after restoration, will likely be displayed in a \u201ccompletely enclosed\u201d case going forward.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe area will reopen as soon possible,\u201d said Holland in the Council\u2019s announcement. \u201cIn the meantime we would like to remind all visitors that they should observe and respect any barriers and signs in place that are there to protect our important heritage and history.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe coffin, according to the Council, was not exactly in pristine condition prior to the incident. It was discovered in three pieces in 1921 at the priory, and contains a crack in the center and missing piece along the top. The museum was able to recover the newly dislodged piece of sandstone, and plans to reattach it using \u201cspecial adhesives.\u201d

aVIn a recent interview with Time Out London, the actor Daniel Radcliffe mentions that he was once rejected by a Frieze Art Fair dealer because he wasn\u2019t exactly what the gallery was hoping for in a buyer.\u000a\u000aThe relevant quote, courtesy of The Art Newspaper:\u000a\u000a\u201cI went to Frieze Art Fair and saw a painting by Jim Hodges. The guy said, \u2018No, we\u2019re waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that.\u2019 I was like, thanks, thanks a lot,\u201d says the miffed movie star in Time Out.\u000a\u000aBastards! But wait! Is that the whole story? Because he spun a similar yarn to The Guardian in 2009 that ended much more happily:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dealer said they wanted to sell it to a more prestigious collector, and Jim got word of this. Turns out he\u2019s a massive Harry Potter fan and insisted they sell it to me. Ever since then I\u2019ve been really good friends with Jim and his best mate Tim, a photographer. And they are two gay guys, artists, in New York, and they introduced me to these amazing, crazy, mad, weird, extraordinary people. I was immediately embraced by the New York tranny community!\u201d The Hodges work, Mona D, Mary And Me, is \u201cbasically a drawing of blue ink on white paper. And it\u2019s the words, \u2018Oh for crying out loud\u2019 which is something his mum always used to say, as I think probably all our mothers did. And in the midst of it, it\u2019s weirdly calligraphic.\u201d What was its appeal? \u201cI suppose \u2013 without meaning to sound like it\u2019s a link to Harry Potter \u2013 it\u2019s about finding something magical and fantastical in a mundane phrase. That\u2019s what\u2019s lovely about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor also apparently owns a Damien Hirst butterfly painting, which \u201c[he] love[s].\u201d

aVThere was only one thing standing between Joan and her new man: Harley. Petite with luxurious, black curly hair and expressive brown eyes, she was obviously devoted to the guy Joan had just started seeing.\u000a\u000aI should probably mention that Harley is a miniature toy poodle.\u000a\u000a\u201cI always thought a man who loved animals would be a good thing,\u201d she said. I sat in front of the espresso machine, visiting Joan at work, while she anxiously steamed soy milk for a latte. \u201cBut he shares custody of the dog with his ex. They have a schedule for weekends and holidays. It\u2019s just too much.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow long did they have the dog for?\u201d I asked. I could understand being attached to a pet. I had a dog with my ex.\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo years. He FaceTimes with the dog twice a week, which means he\u2019s really talking to his ex-girlfriend. I think it\u2019s an excuse,\u201d she worries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho broke up with who?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe dumped him because she cheated. He was devastated and almost took her to court over Harley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you want to meet the dog?\u201d I asked her. It was like we were talking about a kid.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe. He said he\u2019s not ready for that yet. He doesn\u2019t want Harley to get attached. I think that\u2019s bullshit. He\u2019s going to have to choose.\u201d\u000a\u000aI thought Joan was overreacting; they\u2019d barely been going out for two weeks. That\u2019s nothing in the scheme of modern dating timeframes. By this stage, you\u2019re often lucky if you\u2019ve met your new potential mate\u2019s friends yet. So why would she expect to have a say in how he conducts his relationship with an estranged poodle?\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you do about your dog when you got a divorce?\u201d she asked me.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing. I had to walk away from that entire part of my life,\u201d I said, while fighting not to fall into that emotional hole and the welling tears that would follow. But I kept my cool as I proceeded to tell Joan about the furry casualty of my broken marriage, the dog I will refer to as \u201cBob\u201d to protect his identity.\u000a\u000aQuite honestly, I didn\u2019t want any pets to begin with. Usually, you hear stories of women fawning over baby animals and bringing them home to a cranky significant other. In our marriage, the traditional gender dynamic was often swapped, and this was one of those instances. I was leaning toward a hard no when he suggested we adopt a dog. He sent me a picture of Bob, then just a puppy with a wistful look in his eye. He was found in an alley in North Carolina, huddled together with his brother. And then, inevitably, once I met the little canine, I was in love. Yet my practical side still nagged. Financially, it would be a strain. But I was basically going through the motions with everything in my life, and I already had firmly cemented the habit of not quite thinking things through completely (i.e. getting married to begin with), so why stop now? I was sucked into the cuteness of Bob the puppy.\u000a\u000aAs precious as he was, the first few weeks were hard. He went through my closet, chewing on shoe after shoe, but inevitably just one in a pair, leaving the other in an impeccable but totally unwearable state due to the loss of its mate. He pooped all over my white West Elm duvet, and seemed to target the items to which I was emotionally attached for destruction\u2014almost like he knew.\u000a\u000aBut I couldn\u2019t be mad at a puppy, he was as charming as he was destructive. Though it was putting a definite cramp in my style. I could no longer just get up and go at my leisure in the mornings. I couldn\u2019t hang out with my girlfriends after work because I had to go home and walk Bob. My ex had timed Bob\u2019s adoption horribly\u2014he had just started a new job with such long hours that it left me, at least at first, as the sole parent. I felt such frustration every time he misbehaved. I loved that dog, but still doubted the decision to adopt him because I was so totally out of my depth.\u000a\u000aMy feelings about Bob changed dramatically when we had to take him to the Animal Medical Center emergency room one night after he became very ill. He would have to stay overnight, they told us. The nurse brought him out so we could say goodbye until the next day, and I broke down crying when I saw the tiny IV they had inserted into his little leg. I no longer cared about the damage done to my material items. I was all about Bob. He soon recovered and grew up into a handsome dog. Yes, he continued to ruin my shoes and the few pairs of designer sunglasses I had purchased off of Rue La La, but I also learned to put things out of reach.\u000a\u000aDogs are always happy to see you no matter what. It was a guarantee that I\u2019d come home to him wagging his tail at the end of a long day. Animals feed off of the emotions around them. When you\u2019re happy, they\u2019re happy with you. When you\u2019re not, they notice. As things became strained at home, Bob grew depressed. The air was always thick with tension and drama. We were living in a non-stop argument loop. Everyone was in low spirits. Seeing an animal overwhelmed with sadness because it\u2019s owners hated each other just added to my need to break our unhealthy cycle.\u000a\u000aThen the night came when I finally had the courage to leave. I sat with my bags packed for two hours before I actually did, terrified of what would lie ahead.\u000a\u000aI knew that once I left that apartment I would never be able to go back. Leaving is always the last thing one wants to do in a relationship. There are no set formulas; breakups are emotional shit storms. If the relationship was complicated, our split was even more so. We were involved for almost seven years, and Bob was a part of my life for five. Seeing Bob after the split would have meant revisiting emotions and memories that were best left in the past, for everyone involved. So to move on from my ex, I had to move on from Bob, too.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d said Joan, when I\u2019d finished, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cThis guy only had Harley for two years, you had Harley for five. He doesn\u2019t need to see his dog!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNah, don\u2019t take that away from him,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d wait another month to see how it plays out. It\u2019s been barely two weeks, and when did they break up?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSix weeks ago,\u201d she said, looking angry.\u000a\u000aMaybe it\u2019s not surprising to say that a week later when Joan gave the guy an ultimatum, her or Harley, he chose Harley. Then he chose to get back with his ex a few weeks afterwards. Even if her demands weren\u2019t quite fair, it seems her instincts were certainly on track. Luckily, Joan\u2019s next man was an animal lover with sole custody of his dog, no exes included.\u000a\u000aDo I regret not throwing a custody battle? I honestly can\u2019t say with certainty. Of course I\u2019m sad I can\u2019t see Bob again. I\u2019ve toyed with the idea of finding a neutral party that could transport Bob back and forth, and trying to reach an agreement with my ex, but for now I\u2019m leaving things the way they are. I still don\u2019t know that it would be wise to bring Bob, and the memories that come with him, back into my life. It takes a little longer for the dust to settle in the wake of some relationships than in others. That\u2019s if it ever settles at all.

aVEven though human rights lawyer Amal Clooney is spending her Italian vacation in the company of her three-month-old twins and George Clooney, she appears to be having a rather relaxing time. For proof, just look at her holiday wardrobe.\u000a\u000aGone are the tailored dresses and structured coats she\u2019s often photographed wearing as she steps into a courthouse. She seems to have ditched the figure hugging, thigh-skimming frocks she usually wears to dine out with her movie star husband in New York and London. And you better believe she is not squeezing her feet into any stilettos.\u000a\u000aInstead, during her time spent in Lake Como, Amal has embraced a more flowing silhouette\u2014which is ideal for night after night of pasta, pizza and red wine. So let\u2019s break down her looks, one paparazzi photo at a time.\u000a\u000aThe first shot from her vacation provided a front row view to Amal\u2019s workout gear. Dressed in head-to-toe navy\u2014and color coordinating with her husband\u2014she eschewed traditional tennis whites for something a bit edgier. Along with a navy ruffled skirt and a \u201cSunday\u201d tank top from Sundek (that retails for just $39), she slipped on a raffia visor that perfectly matched her color scheme. Though this workout look was rather matchy-matchy, the loose silhouette is really laid back and happens to be a far cry from the skintight Lululemon leggings that are a uniform of sorts in gyms around the globe.\u000a\u000aAmal did turn up the glam factor for a night at Harry\u2019s Bar, slipping into an emerald green frock by Stella McCartney. This might be the most dressy look from her Italian getaway, but you\u2019ll notice that she\u2019s still favoring a loose silhouette, which is directly related to a chilled out attitude.\u000a\u000aBy slipping into a black and white striped jumpsuit from Elisabetta Franchi to dine at Il Gatto Nero, Amal decided to show off her technical fashion knowledge. Though the jumpsuit is nipped in at the waist, the overall hourglass shape is both casual and cool. She smartly opted for vertical stripes, which add inches to her already impressive height. Topping off the jumpsuit are a pair of tassel earrings from Totally Tala, a brand helmed by none other than Amal\u2019s sister, Tala Alamuddin.\u000a\u000aFor a dinner at Villa d\u2019Este, a stunning hotel that provides sweeping views of Lake Como, Amal opted for billowing pants from Rosie Assoulin. Featuring yet another striped print, this time Amal chose a flattering chevron style in red\u2014and the style icon paired her wide-leg pants with a rouge camisole from the same designer. Easily accessorized with just a gold watch and clutch in the same color, this outfit was a welcome reprieve from the usual go-to ruffled shirt dress that appears to be the biggest trend of 2017. Plus, the trouser and top pair is far more polished any rumpled linen outfit.\u000a\u000aSure, the human rights lawyer might be dressing like she\u2019s on vacation, but she\u2019s still rather pulled together. What more would you expect from Amal Clooney?

aV\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s drizzling rain outside when I meet Ashley Eckstein, the actress who voices the fan favorite animated Star Wars character Ahsoka Tano and founder of the rapidly growing geek girl fashion line Her Universe. But inside Alice\u2019s Tea Cup\u2014her suggestion for tea, scones and restorative afternoon treats\u2014we\u2019ve found a cozy sanctum. Up a colorful rickety staircase, and beneath a glowing chandelier, I\u2019m greeted by Eckstein, who is donning one of Her Universe\u2019s newest designs: a fitted jean jacket embroidered with the Star Wars credo across the back, \u201cMay the Force Be With You.\u201d While Eckstein is only in New York briefly before heading West to check out the new Her Universe offices in Los Angeles now that the company has been acquired by retail giant Hot Topic, and then flying back East to her home in Florida, she happens to be a devoted Alice in Wonderland fan, and so there\u2019s always time for a tea party.\u000a\u000aHaving trouble finding a women\u2019s Star Trek t-shirt, or perhaps a Doctor Who hoodie that is not pink? Her Universe has you covered. The company began as a small t-shirt business in 2010 and has since evolved into an online fashion destination for affordable, diverse and refreshingly chic fan gear for women. Eckstein started Her Universe shortly after she began her voice work as Ahsoka Tano, when a personal search for Star Wars clothing to celebrate her new role left her with unsettlingly few options.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt really started honestly from a selfish place: What would I want? What would I wear?\u201d she tells me, as our tea arrives at the table. Early on, she set out to be different, and established a few rules that have become the core of what makes Her Universe appeal to fangirls. \u201cI love the color pink, but in the beginning [I decided] there would be nothing in our line with the color pink. Female fans, they\u2019d kind of been treated like an afterthought. They would make 20 shirts for guys and one shirt for girls, and it would be in pink and it would say \u2018I Heart Star Wars.\u2019 We\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it, which was at the time unheard of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it.\u201d \u2014 Her Universe founder Ashley Eckstein\u000a\u000aAnd so, Eckstein embarked on an ambitious venture: to create an apparel market for female fans where there was none. She found a manufacturer to partner with, and sought out her first license with Star Wars from Lucasfilm. \u201cI think we started out with 9 t-shirts, and that was it,\u201d she says. As the company grew, it acquired licenses from the Syfy channel, Disney, Marvel, BBC and Studio Ghibli, and expanded its offerings to include sweaters, jackets, dresses, leggings and an accessories line. Browse the Her Universe website and you\u2019ll just as soon find retro-style shirts with Thor, Spider-Man and Loki as you will a black skirt decorated with rainbow lightsaber design and a red, yellow and blue Captain Marvel Jacket. The company\u2019s line is stocked with graphic tees, dresses inspired by characters like Boba Fett and Agent Carter, as well as plus size options and clothes for kids.\u000a\u000aTaking the leap from t-shirts to fashion, meant finding a bigger partner. In 2016, Her Universe became a subsidiary of Hot Topic, though Eckstein still retains full control of the company. The move, she says, has just allowed the company to do more. Today, Her Universe hosts an annual fashion show at San Diego Comic Con, has retail partnerships with brands such as Kohl\u2019s to create a line of activewear, and a publishing imprint. In just a few short years, Eckstein has helped make geek girl gear into an industry.\u000a\u000aFandom has been a part of Eckstein\u2019s life for as long as she can remember, she tells me. Growing up, her father worked for Disney, and her love of Star Wars has always been a constant. She moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and worked in film and television before landing what she calls her \u201cdream come true\u201d role voicing Ahsoka, the first female Jedi to lead a series in the Star Wars franchise, and who has helped pave the way for a new generation of strong female characters like Rey and Jynn Erso. But while women today are more visible in the sci-fi and fantasy world than ever (roughly half of Comic Con attendees are women, and a 2013 survey by Wired found that similar numbers applied to fans of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.) However, in 2008 when Eckstein began her work with the franchise, she found that female fans faced more discrimination and bullying than acceptance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought, this is no way to live your life. Being a sci-fi fan is literally a part of your DNA, it\u2019s a part of who you are. Like I said, to me, I love tea parties, I love Alice in Wonderland, I love cupcakes and I love Star Wars. It\u2019s just a descriptor of who I literally say I am\u2014it\u2019s not a trend.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo while Her Universe is primarily known for its apparel line, it\u2019s also become a tight knit community for fangirls, both online and at comic con conventions and fan events. Eckstein travels constantly, bouncing between her work as Ahsoka and being the public face of her company. Critical to her success has been staying active on social media. Today, Her Universe\u2019s Twitter account has 54,000+ followers, on Instagram 67,000 and the brand reaches across Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr and Snapchat.\u000a\u000a\u201cA big part of our strategy was to go grassroots\u2026to interact with the fans directly,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the girls think they\u2019re talking to me it\u2019s because they are, and it has been from Day 1. It\u2019s just me asking the fans, What do you want?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what they want, it seems, are options. \u201cWe need [designs] for different aspects of our lifestyle. When you go to work you\u2019re not just going to wear a big logo T. Maybe you\u2019re going to wear a blazer where it\u2019s just a black blazer on the outside, but the lining is lined with Delta shields.\u201d Her Universe now offers exactly that: Behold the open-front Trek Blazer, which is part of the new collection for ThinkGeek.\u000a\u000aWhile Her Universe designs offer wide appeal to the most casual and devoted fans (who doesn\u2019t love R2D2?), creating designs that will appeal to both isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cI did discover there\u2019s a difference between super inside designs that may speak to the hardcore fans, and then you have to offer a design that even casual fans will like to. If you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000aHer Universe may have opened the market for geek girl fashion, but it\u2019s no longer the only player in the game. Major companies such as M.A.C. cosmetics and Columbia sportswear have created Star Wars-inspired collections, and Rodarte hit the run way with a line of couture gowns. But Eckstein isn\u2019t intimidated by the competition\u2014far from it, she embraces it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for it because everyone always wants to strive for what they see on the runway, but not everyone can afford that $4,000 dress. So, then they come to companies like ours. We\u2019re known for being affordable fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more mainstream it becomes in fashion, it makes it more acceptable for girls to walk in to work and wear a Star Wars blazer, and for it to be acceptable. And that\u2019s what I want. [For] fans to celebrate their fandom.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow that geek girl has gone mainstream, what\u2019s next? Eckstein has some predictions: \u201cThe Superhero lifestyle and look is on trend. But also\u2014last year we saw it at the Met Gala and we saw it at the Her Universe fashion show\u2014is wearable technology.\u201d The winner of the 2016 Her Universe fashion show used thermochromatic pigment and heating tape to make the Marauder\u2019s Map from Harry Potter appear and disappear on a dress in the time it took to walk the length of the runway.\u000a\u000a\u201cYears ago that would have appeared very geeky in the fashion world\u2026now it\u2019s becoming couture,\u201d she quips. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m excited about that, I think that trend is just starting. We\u2019re seeing it on the runways, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that comes into everyday fashion.\u201d\u000a\u000aEckstein admits that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead before the pop culture world becomes an equal space for female fans and entrepreneurs. But in fashion, the geek girl revolution is well on its way.

aVThroughout Donald Trump\u2019s time in office, the Democratic Party has struggled to find its footing. In dealing with an absence of power in Congress and the executive branch, the party has failed to rise above the internal battles that plagued it in 2016. Scandals, trials, and new books due for release this fall don\u2019t bode well for the Democratic Party as it prepares to orient itself for the 2018 elections.\u000a\u000aOn August 23, the Associated Press reported that the jury has been decided for Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial, which is expected to proceed for at least the next two months. Menendez was indicted in 2015 for accepting political bribes in the form of campaign donations, vacations, and private jet flights from Florida Optometrist Salomon Melgen. Melgen was convicted of Medicare fraud earlier this year and recently had his sentencing postponed until after Menendez\u2019s trial, fueling speculation that Melgen may cooperate with prosecutors in the case. If convicted, Menendez could be replaced by Republican Gov. Chris Christie before he leaves office in January 2018, further damaging the reputation of an already unpopular Democratic Party. Menendez would be the second Democrat serving in federal government to be convicted on corruption charges this year; In May 2017, Congresswoman Corrinne Brown, who served 12 terms in Congress, was convicted on charity fraud charges.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been in disarray for years, and new DNC Chair Tom Perez has yet reverse its downward trajectory. The organization\u2019s messaging is frequently mocked. Recently, it awkwardly complained about Trump not fulfilling his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and sent a fundraising letter that went viral on Twitter because it was looked like a debt collection bill. The DNC has lagged in fundraising, significantly falling behind the RNC and gradually adding to their debt, which currently stands at $3.4 million.\u000a\u000aAfter resigning from her post as DNC chair and rigging the primaries for Clinton, former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz remains plagued by scandal. Her former IT staffer, Imran Awan, was indicted last week on four charges, including bank fraud and providing false statements, and a separate federal investigation is ongoing for equipment and data theft. Wasserman Schultz has obstructed the investigation in her own right and inexplicably defended the staffer up until his recent arrest. The U.S. Capitol Police and FBI won\u2019t comment on the investigation until it\u2019s complete, but as long as it continues, the scandal will plague the party.\u000a\u000aIn addition to these ongoing issues facing the Democratic Party, new books from Hillary Clinton and former DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile are set to release this fall. Both will garner significant media attention and drag out the party\u2019s internal battle. Hillary Clinton\u2019s book, What Happened, which is due for release on September 12, is likely to increase her supporters\u2019 fantasy of her being president, as though Clinton\u2019s long existing and prevalent flaws, including the FBI investigation into her e-mail server, were all a conspiracy theory. Donna Brazile\u2019s upcoming book, Hacks, which is due for release in early November, will serve more tone deaf excuses for the Democratic Party\u2019s woes.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic Party has a long, arduous battle ahead to recoup the losses it suffered throughout the Obama administration, but the party leadership has resisted any reforms or changes to its inept leadership. The next few months hold little promise that Democrats will figure out how to boost their popularity. Instead, the problems that have plagued the party throughout the last year will continue to do so.

aVThe legalization of marijuana may soon replace abortion as our society\u2019s most controversial issue. Like abortion, the debate never seems to end.\u000a\u000aDuring the 1970s, a government commission recommended that marijuana use should not be criminal or subject someone to indictment based on its findings that it posed very little risk to the public. However, President Nixon took a different direction, declaring all drug abuse as \u201cpublic enemy number one in the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was created in 1970 to determine how marijuana should be regulated under federal criminal law. When the Controlled Substances Act was passed, Congress tentatively classified it as a Class I substance; however, legislators also acknowledged that additional study was warranted to verify if it indeed warranted the law\u2019s harshest designation.\u000a\u000aAfter conducting extensive studies, the Commission found that many of the negative public opinions about marijuana were unfounded. \u201cLooking only at the effects on the individual, there, is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the experimental or intermittent use of the natural preparations of cannabis,\u201d the report stated. On the basis of its findings, the Commission also recommended that simple possession should be decriminalized, concluding:\u000a\u000a[T]he criminal law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate. The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior, a step which our society takes only \u2018with the greatest reluctance.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe recommendations were unexpected and met with significant resistance from President Nixon. He even attempted to influence the Commission\u2019s findings by strong-arming its chairman, Raymond P. Shafer, whom Nixon had believed would come down against legalization. \u201cYou\u2019re enough of a pro to know that for you to come out with something that would run counter to what the Congress feels and what the country feels, and what we\u2019re planning to do, would make your commission just look bad as hell,\u201d Nixon stated.\u000a\u000aUltimately, nothing became of the report, as neither the Nixon Administration nor Congress took any further action. As a result, marijuana remains a Class I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Ironically, the classification is reserved for drugs with \u201chigh potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment.\u201d\u000a\u000aDonald Scarinci is a managing partner at Lyndhurst, N.J.-based law firm Scarinci Hollenbeck. He is also the editor of the Constitutional Law Reporter and Government & Law blogs.

aVIf Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has his way, Jaime Lannister will depart Game of Thrones in a brilliant flash of dragon fire. \u201cIt has to be a dragon death,\u201d he tells me, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the dragons that get him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re on the third floor of Greenwich Steakhouse, the Village melting outside under Manhattan\u2019s first truly warm day of the year, sitting surrounded by wine racks at a table long enough for a Lannister\u2019s living room. Coster-Waldau, his Danish accent far more pronounced than it is in Westeros, his eyes a White Walker shade of piercing blue, eats a single cookie off a tiny round plate, something I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if it were not being done by the six-foot-two result of a sketch artist being asked to draw Prince Charming. This cookie should be baked with gold, and there should be hundreds more; thousands more; enough to make A Song of Ice and Fire author George RR Martin spend at least four pages describing them.\u000a\u000aCoster-Waldau is in town to promote Evan Katz\u2019s low-budget noir Small Crimes, streaming now on Netflix, but one doesn\u2019t get Jaime Lannister in a room without discussing HBO\u2019s fantasy mega-hit; and one doesn\u2019t discuss Game of Thrones, period, without eventually discussing death. Which is how we land on the actor\u2019s desire for his own character\u2014the Lannister family\u2019s stone-jawed golden boy, incestuous father of two with sister Cersei (Lena Headey), a.k.a. Kingslayer, Oathbreaker and a whole host of other unsavory epithets\u2014to wave his one-handed farewell to the consistently kill-happy series by being burnt to a crisp by Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) massive, CGI dragons.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust fried,\u201d he says, clearly relishing the idea. \u201cHe has to burn. Has to.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, whether this is speculation or spoiler is known only by an extraordinarily exclusive crew; the series, debuted in 2011 and quickly ballooned into a worldwide phenomenon, has since surpassed its A Song of Ice and Fire source material. When it returns in July for its penultimate season, we will be over The Wall and into the unknown, the plot-points existing for now only in the heads of the cast and crew, series co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and George RR Martin himself.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s something important to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: the man is a sharer, to say the least, perhaps the result of being raised in Tybjerg, a tiny village situated in the countryside of southern Zealand. Within an hour of meeting him, I knew the TV series the actor was currently hooked on (Silicon Valley, loved the premiere); I knew the poster that hung on his childhood bedroom wall (the album cover of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d); I heard the story of a young Coster-Waldau serenading his schoolmates with a Rod Stewart cover (\u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy,\u201d of course) and was filled in on some hot Tybjerg gossip from circa 1980 about the time the principal of his middle school\u2019s wife started an affair with another teacher. \u201cNo, no, it gets even better,\u201d Coster-Waldau says before I could interrupt, fully headed down memory lane at this point. (For the record, it did get better. Small-town Denmark scandal is my new favorite scandal).\u000a\u000aSo, surely, nabbing a few spoilers from the biggest show on television by conversation\u2019s end wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, would it? \u201cFor years there was the whole thing with \u2018book readers\u2019 who knew what was going to happen. But it is more intense now, because nobody knows,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cThere has been a couple times where I\u2019ve actually, by accident, said something I shouldn\u2019t have. But because nobody knows, they don\u2019t necessarily pick up on it.\u201d\u000a\u000aI get what he\u2019s saying; the anticipation for more Thrones\u2014both show and book series\u2014has reached such a fever pitch of online hypothesizing and fan theories that an actual correct guess would be lost in the noise like a musician playing the wrong note in concert.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you go online you can definitely read every plot point that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou can find the ending of Game of Thrones on the internet. It\u2019s there. But you wouldn\u2019t know. Of course, nobody really wants to know.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, I throw the journalism ethics book out the third floor Greenwich Steakhouse window to abruptly correct my interview subject; I\u2019d very much like to know, on the record, the ending of Game of Thrones. He laughs. \u201cMaybe I should try it one day. Just say, \u2018Yeah, here is exactly what happens.\u2019 You\u2019d probably just go, \u2018Pfffft, no, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s right, of course. There is no way Jaime Lannister actually dies by dragon fire, no way the actor who plays him just came out and told me because, hey, how would I even know?\u000a\u000aRight?\u000a\u000aThe look on his face at this point, so self-assuredly charming in victory, is so Lannister-esque I half expect him to pick up that cookie\u2014that one single cookie off that tiny, tiny plate\u2014with a hand made of solid gold.\u000a\u000aIn the odd-ball dark comedy Small Crimes, Coster-Waldau plays ex-police officer Joe Denton, a world-weary five o\u2019clock shadow with legs pretty much the exact diametric opposite aesthetically of Jaime Lannister\u2019s flowing hair\u2019d gallantry; where people call Jaime \u201cKingslayer,\u201d the press calls Joe \u201cSlash Cop,\u201d a nod to the knife-wielding assault charge that landed him a six-year prison sentence. We meet Joe fresh out of jail for a bloody, brutal little film that often manages to simultaneously be quite funny, in which Coster-Waldau spends a great deal of screen time getting his ass kicked with everything from a stun gun to a pair of nunchucks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love that stuff,\u201d the actor smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because he deserves it. What we tried to do, and I spoke to [writer-director Evan Katz] about this, I said \u2018we have to lean into that aspect of it, because it is such a dark story and Joe is such a scumbag.\u2019 You think it\u2019s going to be one of those movies where a guy turns his life around, and he then goes and makes every wrong decision you can possibly make. So you have to be able to laugh at him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe tried to find the humor even while he\u2019s getting beaten up. Like, when [co-star] Gary Cole tases me, it\u2019s like, you know\u2026\u201d Coster-Waldau trails off and instead convulses in his chair, tongue out and eyes bulging, in a comically over-the-top rendition of a man being tased in the stomach by well-known character actor Gary Cole.\u000a\u000aThat is another important thing to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: he\u2019s simultaneously animated and engaged, an interviewer\u2019s delight. He will answer with a specific story, a detailed childhood memory or thought-out rumination on life itself, and in lieu of an actual anecdote he\u2019ll act out an answer for you.\u000a\u000aPerfect example: When discussing his fondness for his truly immoral Small Crimes character\u2014and that fondness is delightfully palpable throughout\u2014Coster-Waldau begins by saying \u201ceven though Joe is suck a fuck-up, I still\u2026well I don\u2019t care for him but I still want to know what happens to him. I don\u2019t want to be his best buddy, but there\u2019s something about him. He\u2019s like, what\u2019s the word\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a loss, Coster-Waldau simply does a spot-on impression of a fishing lure staying afloat, bobbing relentlessly above the water\u2019s surface. \u201cJoe is like that,\u201d he goes on afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m back, I can still make it no matter what.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA running theme throughout Small Crimes is that abstract idea of \u201csecond chances\u201d; whether or not they exist, and what it then would mean to truly earn one.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do believe in second chances,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cGod knows I believe in third chances as well. But the thing is, do you believe you can actually change? Fundamentally change the person you are? I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when I press for specifics, a moment in time when the actor, be it professional or personal, was given a second chance, he draws a blank. He puts his face in his hand and thinks about it, really thinks about it because if Coster-Waldau is going to properly answer an interview question\u2014no, if he\u2019s going to offer a life lesson, he\u2019s going to find the right words. Right now, though, the only thing popping into his head is a 2014 film he starred in, quite literally titled A Second Chance.\u000a\u000aI posit, only half-jokingly, that perhaps he simply does not make mistakes.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I do. I do,\u201d he says. \u201cGod no, I have made mistakes. We all do. But I don\u2019t know about the whole idea that forgiveness is a one-off/ I\u2019ve gotten a lot of second chances. You kind of have to earn it. We have this weird belief, which is very fundamental to our culture, that forgiveness is to be given. You can just get it, you can be forgiven for anything. Which would be wonderful, because guilt is a bitch to carry around.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe brightens suddenly. \u201cI do remember one thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor launches into a story that occurred not in his career, or on the set of Game of Thrones, or even over the course of his now-19-year marriage to Greenlandic singer Nukaaka Coster-Waldau, but during his grade-school years. A classmate stole a Swedish exchange student\u2019s video game\u2014Coster-Waldau calls it \u201cone of those beep beep games,\u201d which is endlessly endearing\u2014which then ended up in his own possession.\u000a\u000a\u201cI couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of it,\u201d he remembers of harboring the contraband \u2018beep beep game.\u2019 \u201cI called another friend, and he said, \u2018You have to bring it to the principal.\u2019 It was beautiful, because it was so innocent. \u2018You have to.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe problem, Coster-Waldau tells me, is that the principal was \u201ca psychopath\u201d (one-third of the aforementioned scandalous affair, actually). But still, the young Coster-Waldau summoned his courage and returned the exchange student\u2019s console, and life in small-town Denmark moved on.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, no,\u201d Coster-Waldau laughs. \u201cThe principal actually made me feel terrible, like I was on my way to prison for probably the rest of my life. He kind of just took the game back and said \u2018you\u2019re a piece of shit, you little scumbag.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cMy point,\u201d he continues, now beaming, \u201cis that he did not give me a second chance. But just the fact that I did it actually made me feel better. It was the action, not the forgiveness. I knew that I did the right thing. Not him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich, oddly enough, brings us right back to Jaime Lannister.\u000a\u000aYou see, the incident that gave the character the title of \u201cKingslayer\u201d occurred before the events of Game of Thrones began; Jaime, still captain of the Kingsguard, drove a sword through the very king he swore to protect, Aerys II Targaryen. Which, yes, is not the best career move. What Jaime\u2019s detractors do not know is Aerys had given the order to ignite countless caches of wildfire hidden throughout the city, killing thousands of innocent people, when Jaime stepped in to stop him; a crucial fact we do not learn until a season 3 bath tub confession from Jaime to Gwendoline Christie\u2019s Brienne of Tarth.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this is true, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone? Why didn\u2019t you tell Lord Stark?\u201d asks Brienne, referring to Sean Bean\u2019s ultra-moral Eddark Stark.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?\u201d Jaime answers, one line of a performance that landed Coster-Waldau on many an Emmy Snubs list in 2013. \u201cHe judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, not to outright compare regicide with the theft of a middle-schooler\u2019s video game system, but there is a certain parallel. Jaime Lannister as a character lives a life condemned\u2014is \u201cOathbreaker\u201d really that far off from \u201clittle scumbag\u201d?\u2014because of a choice he made, that he and nearly he alone knows was right. It is, as Coster-Waldau said, the action that defines him, not anyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u000a\u000aFour seasons later, and this parallel still colors the way Coster-Waldau plays Jaime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat scene in season 3 was a very important moment,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe most important for Jaime, I think, was in that bath with Brienne. It was called \u2018Kissed by Fire,\u2019 that episode.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich is why,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI think Jaime should be killed by fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would be poetic, in its way. A perfect circle. Maybe a little\u2026too perfect? \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re watching next season. You\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, fuck.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s kidding, of course. Jaime Lannister isn\u2019t going to be burned to death in season seven of Game of Thrones. That is not, as Coster-Waldau joked before, \u201cexactly what happens.\u201d Right?\u000a\u000aPffft, no, it\u2019s not.

aVChristopher Meloni would like to say he\u2019s sorry. Not to me, per se, sitting across from him in an airy loft above NoHo\u2019s cobblestoned Bond Street, but to his 233,000 Twitter followers, mostly. Maybe a little bit to 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Snatched, in which the actor appears briefly but memorably. Possibly, in a more roundabout, elliptical sort of way, he\u2019s even saying sorry to Snatched co-stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn. \u201cI find it very difficult to stay on point with all the promotion that I should be doing,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cI want to sit here right now and say I do apologize for being distracted at times with the magnitude of the horror that is this administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the Trump Administration, by the way, as in comma Donald. As in current President of the United States / former host of The Apprentice. As in the man who fired FBI Director James Comey just 24 hours after Meloni and I met to discuss a funny little comedy in which he plays a wannabe Indiana Jones-type named Roger. But if you want your \u201ccelebrities, they\u2019re just like us!\u201d moment, understand that Chris Meloni is having that relatable issue focusing on his work, on his art, on the comedy of it all when he feels that every refresh of the Twitter page brings Mad Max: Fury Road one step closer to becoming a documentary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve found this administration, and their stance not only on institutions but facts and numbers, is an outright attack on truth. Which, with every autocrat and in any dystopian novel, that\u2019s rule number one,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cThat there are still followers, I find that very dangerous. And that the attack from people who agree with the administration is to paint it as an \u2018us vs them\u2019 situation. Especially us, the libtards, the Hollywood libtards.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom the moment Meloni noted that he \u201cwoke up in a George Orwell novel today,\u201d the actor has been an active, outspoken and occasionally shirtless voice of #resistance. \u201cThe message\u2014which I\u2019m very poor at conveying, I\u2019ll be the first to admit\u2014is that the fight is not \u2018us vs them,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe fight is not against anything. It\u2019s for truth. And you have to agree on the truth. You can have debates on it, but you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aHe trails off, gazing at his hands. After all, he is here to promote Snatched, not a revolution. Finally, he looks up. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny the science of something like climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeloni\u2019s eyes, more like two storm clouds somehow bored into a rock face, have a way of making simple phrases like \u201cyou just can\u2019t\u201d sound very much like a universally acknowledged fact taught in schools across the nation. Of course I\u2019m not going to argue. If any actor has to keep an eye (or two) on our politicians, maybe it should be Chris Meloni.\u000a\u000aActually, we should probably talk about the eyes. Have you ever had Chris Meloni squint at you? It\u2019s terrifying, it really is. It\u2019s the squint that served him so well over 12 seasons and 273 episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Elliot Stabler. It\u2019s the gaze that\u2014and this is a compliment\u2014makes his August Pullman such an effectively enigmatic bounty hunter on WGN America\u2019s slave-era drama, Underground. Hell, it\u2019s the haunted stare of Meloni\u2019s psychotic yet oddly tender Chris Keller I still remember most from HBO\u2019s groundbreaking prison piece, Oz.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had that since I was a child,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a look, a certain stare. It\u2019s not cultivated, it just is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFunny enough, it\u2019s that look, the certain stare that allows Meloni to move so fluidly, and so often between drama and comedy. Keep his simmering intensity and simply change the context, and suddenly he\u2019s Roger in Snatched, exuding the confidence of Indiana Jones while displaying the skill-set of your local Sports Authority\u2019s junior manager. Or, if you will, suddenly he\u2019s Gene in 2001\u2019s summer-camp comedy Wet Hot American Summer\u2014David Wain\u2019s veritable who\u2019s who of comedy icons, A-listers and award-winners while they were all anything but\u2014the PTSD-ridden Vietnam veteran who also just so happens to be sexually attracted to refrigerators and prone to conversations with a talking can of vegetables (voiced by Archer\u2018s H. Jon Benjamin to boot).\u000a\u000aIn person, Meloni occupies that unique space between comedy and drama near-constantly. He lives in it, probably pays rent. I wondered for a while before this interview what kind of person I\u2019d be speaking to; intense or silly? The slave-catcher or the faux-adventurer? The horror show that was his Oz character, or the freak show that was, well, his Freakshow from Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle? The simplest answer is that he\u2019s both, simultaneously. He jokes, loud and often; when a member of his team requests some tunes, the actor puts on Manchester-based pop-rock band The 1975, a suggestion from his 16-year-old daughter. And yet whenever these endearing moments of levity do come up, Meloni\u2019s smile never quite un-arches those interrogation room eyebrows. It\u2019s not a surprise, then, that the method he describes for choosing his next project is an internal one, almost a zen process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, the spirit moves you,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe soul starts to need a different way to express itself. Whether you\u2019re immersed in comedy and suddenly you want to check out a drama, or if you\u2019ve been living in drama you might need a release valve. I\u2019m led by how I feel.\u201d\u000a\u000aRecently, the spirit led Meloni into the director\u2019s chair for only the second time in his career, when he helmed the season 2 episode of Underground, \u201cAuld Acquaintances.\u201d It was a far cry from his first effort\u2014a co-directing credit on National Lampoon\u2019s Dirty Movie in 2011\u2014that required, but was not limited to, blowing up a house, working around lead actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell\u2019s real-life pregnancy, and a lengthy, half-drunk monologue from his own character. \u201cAs an actor I\u2019m just concerned about me, my point of view vis-a-vi all the other actors and the moment,\u201d he says, then leans forward as if sharing a secret. \u201cAs a director, you have to be aware of everything.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re aware of the scene that happened before, while envisioning the scene after, and where this particular moment resonates, plus where each character\u2019s journey goes from here,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen you have to negotiate that, because maybe your idea doesn\u2019t sit with their idea. You have to make decisions on everything. How big do you want the bottle to be, what\u2019s the gun size? Is there a rug or isn\u2019t there a rug? You have to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page, and the page is your vision. Where to set up the camera, when that camera moves, how that camera moves.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy the expansion into directing? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s always that thought of \u2018Once I\u2019m done with this project, I\u2019m technically unemployed.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aClassic case of actor\u2019s dilemma, yes, but Meloni is set for the near-future at least. As part of the latest of what seems like many brand reboots, the SyFy network ordered a pilot for Happy!, adapted from Grant Morrison\u2019s graphic novel. Meloni will star as ex-cop turned mafia hitman Nick Sax, who gets his life back on track with the help of a tiny, blue winged horse voiced by Saturday Night Live\u2018s Bobby Moynihan.\u000a\u000aWhich is great news for fans of a dead-eyed Chris Meloni speaking to imaginary friends. In June, the actor also reprises his Wet Hot role for Netflix\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later (set a decade after the 2001 original, and acting as a follow-up to Netflix\u2019s surprisingly ingenious First Day of Camp). \u201cIt\u2019s all set. All in the can. Ready to roll,\u201d Meloni says on the status of the Wet Hot sequel, but is genuinely tight-lipped about where we will find the appliance-loving Gene.\u000a\u000aThe actor takes a long pause, then finally tells me \u201cGene is a solitary figure leading a life of mystery. He\u2019s trying to get his act together. He\u2019s finding a purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it wasn\u2019t plot-points that brought Meloni back to Camp Firewood in the first place. 10 Years Later reunites the cast\u2014loaded with names like Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd\u2014as well as original creators David Wain and Michael Showalter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know those guys. I trust their sensibilities so much, know their work ethic,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cThey have such a command of the material that it\u2019s really a no-brainer for me. I tell people all the time, it\u2019s like going home again.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe sits up straight then, coming to a much, much more appropriate analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to camp,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get to play with all your old friends.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt that, I swear, his eyes almost soften. Almost.

aVThough the summer box office is down upward of 12 percent and ticket sales have continued their steady decline, Hollywood could take some solace in the fact that New Line Cinema and Warner Bros.\u2019 upcoming horror feature It was tracking for a huge $50 million opening. But now it looks as if those initial projections were inaccurate.\u000a\u000aNew tracking numbers suggest the remake of Stephen King\u2019s classic novel could pull in as much as $60 million in its opening weekend, which would mark the biggest horror movie debut in history and the biggest September opening ever, according to The Wrap. The horror genre is the gift that just keeps on giving at the box office.\u000a\u000aRidley Scott\u2019s 2001 Hannibal still holds the horror movie opening weekend record with $58 million and is followed by 2011\u2019s Paranormal Activity 3, which took in $52.5 million. Hotel Transylvania 2 boasts the biggest September opening with $48.4 million back in 2015, according to Box Office Mojo.\u000a\u000aTypically, R-rated horror films don\u2019t break out like this. Among the biggest opening weekends for R-rated films of all-time, the highest scare flick on the list is 2013\u2019s The Conjuring at No. 33 with $41.8 million. But It is the perfect combination of nostalgia and cross-generational appeal that has intrigued even the most casual of film fans. The movie\u2019s first trailer set the record for most views ever in 24 hours back in March. Clearly, there\u2019s a buzz about It that other movies just aren\u2019t generating this year.\u000a\u000aBut Warner Bros. isn\u2019t getting ahead of itself just yet. Studio sources told The Wrap that internal estimates are far more conservative at a still impressive $35 million-plus, which would put it on pace for roughly $260 million worldwide (off a fairly big budget of $35 million to $40 million). But if It lives up to its $60 million promise and play\u2019s like The Conjuring (3.2 domestic multiplier), it could be looking at a worldwide total somewhere around $450 million!\u000a\u000aWith Wonder Woman, Annabelle: Creation, It and Justice League, Warner Bros. will likely be toasting to a profitable 2017 come New Years.

aVNew Yorkers have always known their city is the center of the universe, so it seems only fair that New York ought to play such an unusually outsized role in this year\u2019s presidential race.\u000a\u000aSure, the city has always funded presidential campaigns and has always seen the candidates visit if only to meet with rich people from whom they would like money. But the state has rarely weighed in formally on the race with a presidential primary that was actually competitive\u2014and never has it had competitive primaries in both parties at the same time. Now, instead of meeting only with the monied class, the candidates are eating pasta in the Bronx and matzo in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aIf having the candidates campaign in New York City, with all its ethnic food and tabloid drama, wasn\u2019t enough, two of the candidates most likely to become the next president are New York residents.\u000a\u000aWith the star power of the presidential campaign in town, it seems even the city\u2019s biggest personalities\u2014its gangly mayor, its mercurial governor, its swaggering prosecutor and grinning police commissioner\u2014have taken a backseat to the action. The campaign is all anyone is talking about, including Mayor Bill de Blasio himself, who has been pining to be a go-to progressive pundit and favored surrogate of Hillary Clinton, with less-than-stellar results.\u000a\u000a(Indeed, Mr. de Blasio has been lucky that all eyes are on the primary: It has meant less attention is being paid to reported investigations of his campaign contributions and his administration\u2019s role in a controversial property sale.)\u000a\u000aThe 2016 race seems to swirl around nearly everyone, as New York Democrats jockey for favor with their old pal Ms. Clinton\u2014perhaps looking for appointments down the line\u2014and jockey for headlines bashing their hometown foe, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s power list has a decided focus, then, on the national figures who call New York City home, the local folks who help keep them in the running and the possibilities the future holds for those people\u2014and what it could all mean for everybody else in town.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Schumer, Senator\u000a\u000aMr. Schumer has been ravenously ambitious since his days as a pothole-filling assemblyman from Brooklyn. Now, as the anointed next leader of the Senate Democrats, with the Democratic Party facing favorable prospects in November, there\u2019s an excellent chance you\u2019ll be calling him Majority Leader Schumer in 2017.\u000a\u000aNew York has never had a majority leader, let alone one from the borough of Kings, and Mr. Schumer will cement his role as the Empire State\u2019s most important elected official. Our city has long struggled on the federal terrain\u2014urban issues just aren\u2019t sexy to Republican congressmen from the Ozarks\u2014but with Mr. Schumer as one of the most powerful elected officials in the country, we\u2019re bound to do a little bit better. No matter who becomes the president\u2014more on that later\u2014Mr. Schumer is one New Yorker who is assured a spot near the top of the heap in Washington.\u000a\u000aHe also arrives at a precarious time for his own party, even as Democrats gloat about the crackup of the GOP in the Year of Trump. The grassroots left, powering Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, is ascendant, and the centrist Schumer has never had a very comfortable relationship with the most liberal end of the Democratic Party. His defense of Wall Street and his ability to raise prodigious sums of money from the financial sector were once nothing but an asset. Mr. Schumer\u2019s rise to power came in part because he could raise cash as well as anyone in politics. Now, with angry progressives demanding purity from their Democrats, Mr. Schumer will have to figure out how to balance his own pragmatist instincts with a political environment that may be unfriendly to people like him. Does Mr. Schumer tack left? Or for the first time in his career, does he resist the political current?\u000a\u000a2. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State\u000a\u000aNot since Thomas Dewey challenged Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 have two New Yorkers\u2014one a mid-life arrival, the other native-born\u2014vied against each other for the White House. And while Ms. Clinton\u2019s democratic socialist primary opponent, Mr. Sanders (a son of Brooklyn himself), may have a few rounds left in him, her nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate is all but assured, assuming nothing comes of her email scandal. Voters remain lukewarm to the ex-secretary of state, but New York\u2019s political elite has scrambled to hoist the former Empire State senator onto their shoulders. The names of her top surrogates in the city dot this list, and some could easily wind up in her administration should she triumph in November. A polarizing figure, Ms. Clinton could have the good fortune of facing an opponent this fall whose unfavorability ratings outstrip even her own.\u000a\u000aAbout that opponent. Mr. Trump, too, is a New Yorker who could be the next president. But truth be told, his influence in this town seems largely relegated to being the target of ire from Democrats, who see a win-win in criticizing a candidate so deeply disliked by so many, even as he is beloved by those who show up to his rallies and to vote for him. It\u2019s unclear yet whether Mr. Trump has shattered the Republican Party or revitalized it, or whether his campaign will be little more than a passing spasm of anti-establishment outrage\u2014and as such, the extent of his true power as a player in New York City remains unclear, too.\u000a\u000aThis list will go to press just hour before some of these open questions will be answered in our state\u2019s primary. If Mr. Trump cracks 50 percent in his hometown, it\u2019ll boost him toward the convention and argue he can be competitive in the northerast in the general. An under-convincing win here will be rough for Ms. Clinton, but if she can win by 10 or more points she\u2019ll keep surging toward November.\u000a\u000a3. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney\u000a\u000aAll pols fear the probing, sardonic eye of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District. After falling heavily last year on the two most powerful legislators in the state, ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and former State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, it seemed to pass over Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2014though the prosecutor is still reportedly peering into potential sweetheart contracts for donors in Buffalo.\u000a\u000aNow Mayor Bill de Blasio and his NYPD are in the anticorruption evangelist\u2019s sights. At issue are likely illegal gifts cops seem to have received from two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top contributors in Brooklyn\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community. The investigation may also implicate one or more of the much-criticized nonprofits the mayor created to raise cash and advance his liberal agenda, which the group Citizens Union labeled a \u201cshadow government\u201d earlier this year.\u000a\u000aGiven his success exposing shady dealings in Albany, City Hall and on Wall Street, Mr. Bharara (a former aide to Mr. Schumer) could well become the attorney general for the United States under a Clinton administration\u2014or, given that Ms. Clinton set up her controversial \u201chomebrew\u201d email server on his turf, he could wind up leading the investigation that denies her the White House.\u000a\u000a4. Andrew Cuomo, Governor\u000a\u000aJust in time for the presidential season, the famously cautious and calculating governor banked left\u2014hard. He forewent his own rumored bid for the White House to instead become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s earliest endorsers and biggest boosters in New York. He also embraced two of the causes he once scoffed at: a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. Both passed in this year\u2019s budget, giving New York some of the most liberal labor laws in the country.\u000a\u000aThe governor has also abandoned his once-proud fiscal conservatism, announcing billions upon billions of dollars worth in infrastructure investments. Every decrepit and despised New York transit hub would get demolished then built anew under the governor\u2019s designs: LaGuardia Airport, Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Nobody seems to know yet where all the money will come from, but sources tell the Observer Mr. Cuomo sees these projects as his legacy in office.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Cuomo is auditioning for some role in Ms. Clinton\u2019s Cabinet (or what that role would be\u2014they\u2019re based in the same state, so vice president is pretty much off the table) or whether he just decided to spite his rival, Mr. de Blasio, by snatching away the mantle of progressivism. Either way, New York City will be a very different place by the time he departs Albany.\u000a\u000a5. Bill de Blasio, Mayor\u000a\u000aFor all his bumbling, fumbling, stumbling, bobbling, unforced errors and outright pratfalls, Mr. de Blasio managed this spring to push through what may be his most significant accomplishment in office: rezoning New York City. From now on, developers will get the benefit of loosened height and density restrictions, but they\u2019ll have to set aside 25 to 30 percent of new apartments for middle-class and lower-middle class tenants.\u000a\u000aThe mayor is still missing a new version of the 421a building tax credit\u2014the gas for his affordable housing engine\u2014but the rule changes have potential to permanently change both the city\u2019s rental market and its physical terrain. That will doubtless outlast Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure at Gracie Mansion, however long that ends up being.\u000a\u000aAfter a few flirtations with his ideological cousin Mr. Sanders, Mr. de Blasio belatedly backed Ms. Clinton, his former employer, for president. His hesitance seemed to earn him her ire, but the mayor paid his penance knocking on doors for her in Iowa, and she appears to have warmed to him again. His grandiose hopes to hold a candidate forum and shape the 2016 race have fallen through, and he seems to have accepted a humbler role in the process, shilling for her in New York, the same as nearly every other Democrat in the city.\u000a\u000aHe just better hope that Mr. Bharara\u2019s investigation goes away.\u000a\u000a6. Bill Bratton, Police Commissioner\u000a\u000aThe media-savvy police commissioner about town was at the top of this last year and with good reason: Mr. Bratton is many ways a better politician than the mayor who hired him. He is still the commissioner who seems to get the most leeway from the mayor he serves. But while Mr. Bratton dominated city headlines last year\u2014going against the mayor to call for more cops in the\u000a\u000abudget, dealing with the fallout of massive antipolice protests\u2014things are simply a bit quieter this year, as City Hall moved to focus on housing more than the issues aligned with the NYPD. And Mr. Bharara\u2019s probe into higher-ups at the NYPD accepting gifts is sure to be a headache\u2014though the mayor is doubtless glad he chose Mr. Bratton to lead the department over one of the men being investigated, former Chief of Department Philip Banks. Mr. Bratton continues to say what\u2019s on his mind, even jumping into the presidential race to take Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to task\u2014and tell him to \u201cshut up\u201d\u2014in response to his proposal to monitor Muslims to prevent terror attacks. Any police commissioner is a major presence in New York but particularly this one, with his penchant for hitting the best restaurants and the biggest social events, filling a role that the homebody mayor doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy much.\u000a\u000a7. Carl Heastie, Assembly Speaker\u000a\u000aHis first year as Assembly speaker, Mr. Heastie gained a reputation for the same detached taciturnity as his predecessor Mr. Silver. This spring, he showed for the first time that he might have some of the fallen pol\u2019s famed negotiating prowess. The Bronx lawmaker shielded the city from up to a billion dollars in cuts to the CUNY system and in Medicaid assistance from Albany that Mr. Cuomo had proposed in his budget. He also laid out a plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, to the governor\u2019s chagrin, indicating that Mr. Heastie is looking to put pressure on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s left flank.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nearly impossible to decipher the speaker\u2019s motivations, but he\u2019s the closest thing Mr. de Blasio has to a powerful friend in Albany\u2014even though he\u2019s much closer to the mayor\u2019s main rival at home, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.\u000a\u000a8. Melissa Mark-Viverito, Council Speaker\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the City Council as mainly a rubber stamp for the mayor\u2014but even if it is, its speaker is looking to make the most of her position. Ms. Mark-Viverito has tried to assert her\u000a\u000aindependence from Mr. de Blasio: making amendments to his housing plan, throwing cold water all over his crumbling effort to ban horse carriages (but only after first carrying the water for it), breaking from him on the efforts to cap Uber in the city. But she\u2019s also used her perch to be a voice on national issues, speaking out frequently on immigration and representation of Latinos in local government and becoming a favored surrogate for Hillary Clinton. In fact, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s political prowess was perhaps best on display with her endorsement of Ms. Clinton\u2014particularly considering how Mr. de Blasio bungled his. Plenty of people are whispering about whether the speaker might be offered a spot in a future Clinton administration when her term in the Council expires.\u000a\u000a9. Anthony Shorris, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aThe unsung bureaucrat who makes City Hall go around, Mr. Shorris is the man who does the day-to-day managing of the city as its first deputy mayor. He took a leading role in reassessing the city\u2019s services for the homeless after one of his fellow deputy mayors hastily left the department and the leader of the Department of Homeless Services was seemingly pushed out. His institutional knowledge of government has been key for Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a10. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO\u000a\u000aThe Goldman Sachs CEO has come a long way from the Brooklyn housing projects he grew up in\u2014financially at least. A search of Ms. Clinton\u2019s donor rolls comes up flush with his employees, providing fodder for both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. (That goes without mentioning all those speeches Goldman paid the former first lady to deliver.) He also counts Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife among his underlings, and he enjoys a fairly warm relationship with Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a11. Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator\u000a\u000aFor now, Gillibrand will be in Schumer\u2019s shadow, but New York\u2019s junior senator has been building her profile as an advocate for women and the sexually abused. Long-removed from her days as a conservative upstate lawmaker viewed skeptically by the city\u2019s Democratic establishment, she just may be future presidential candidate material.\u000a\u000a12. Steven Banks, Commissioner of Social Services\u000a\u000aMr. Banks has emerged in the last year as a major player in the mayor\u2019s administration, rising up a somewhat obscure post at the Human Resources Administration to become the face of the city\u2019s response to a growing and difficult to manage homelessness problem\u2014and its brand-new Commissioner of Social Services. Mr. Banks, who made his bones at the Legal Aid Society suing the departments he now leads, will now oversee both the HRA and the Department of Homeless Services. Even-handed and hyper-knowledgeable about his field, Mr. Banks clearly has the trust of Mr. de Blasio, who has let Mr. Banks lead several of his own City Hall press conferences.\u000a\u000a13. James Capalino, CEO of Capalino + Company\u000a\u000aThis veteran lobbyist\u2019s fortunes have steadily risen since City Hall was taken over by Mr. de Blasio\u2014making his lobbying firm the highest-earning in the city. That\u2019s raised some eyebrows, considering Mr. Capalino\u2019s close relationship with Mr. de Blasio, for whom he\u2019s raised campaign cash. That tight relationship has been attractive to clients of Mr. Capalino\u2019s, particularly the real estate powerhouses like Brookfield Properties and SL Green that employ him. But what\u2019s really put Mr. Capalino in the spotlight, and under the microscope, is his connection to a deal that has proven disastrous for the mayor: the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side property that will allow a private developer to turn what was once an nursing home for AIDS patients into luxury condos\u2014and which helped the building\u2019s owner make a $72 million profit selling it.\u000a\u000a14. Hakeem Jeffries, Congressman\u000a\u000aPossibly Brooklyn\u2019s brightest rising star, the congressman has become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s top lieutenants in the black community. A relatively new member of the New York delegation and a Democrat in the Republican House, Mr. Jeffries has long reportedly eyed other pols\u2019 jobs\u2014including Mr. de Blasio\u2019s and Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s. Perhaps a job in the White House would be a suitable outlet for his ambitions.\u000a\u000a15. Vicki Been and Carl Weisbrod, Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner and Planning Chairman\u000a\u000aThe dynamic duo at the forefront of the mayor\u2019s plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in a decade, Ms. Been and Mr. Weisbrod played major roles in cajoling the planning commission and city council to pass the mayor\u2019s massive rezoning plan. But even after that victory, there\u2019s still plenty to be done in terms of neighborhood-specific efforts, like the combative one underway in East New York.\u000a\u000a16. Thomas Prendergast, MTA Chairman\u000a\u000aMr. Prendergast not only runs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2014and therefore oversees a vital part of nearly every New Yorker\u2019s day\u2014he also serves as a major New York City surrogate for Gov. Cuomo. Often, that means going toe-to-toe with the mayor, arguing over things like the city\u2019s share of the bill for the MTA.\u000a\u000a17. Michael Bloomberg, Former Mayor\u000a\u000aMr. Bloomberg couldn\u2019t stay away from politics forever. When it looked like the nation might face a Sanders/Trump race for the presidency, the billionaire media mogul publicly weighed injecting another New Yorker into the mix\u2014himself. He ultimately realized an independent doesn\u2019t have a prayer in America\u2019s two-party system, but he bitterly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive and demagogic\u201d style upon withdrawing from contention. Look for him to endorse Ms. Clinton after the convention, possibly with his wallet.\u000a\u000a18. Emma Wolfe, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs\u000a\u000aA veteran member of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inner circle, Ms. Wolfe is the mayor\u2019s political fixer and his liaison to the groups outside City Hall with which he must work\u2014the governor\u2019s office, unions, the City Council and just about everyone in Albany. Behind her aw-shucks demeanor is a tough and experienced political operative and one of the mayor\u2019s closest and sharpest advisers.\u000a\u000a19. Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation\u000a\u000aDismiss Mr. Murdoch\u2019s New York Post at your peril. The venerable tabloid is forever a pain for any mayor but especially this one\u2014who just last week saw himself on the wood (that\u2019s the cover, for those who don\u2019t know tab-speak) three days in a row, accused of scandal. For readers who like their criticism of Mr. de Blasio a little classier, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s got The Wall Street Journal\u2014which also offers influential reporting on just about everything else. And then, there\u2019s that little cable powerhouse Fox News. In a town where the media is a major force, Mr. Murdoch is the force behind plenty of it.\u000a\u000a20. Dean Fuleihan, Budget Director\u000a\u000aThe city\u2019s moneyman, Mr. Fuleihan oversees New York\u2019s mammoth budget\u2014proposed to be $82.1 billion this year. It\u2019s a less stressful job than in years past, now that the city has inked contracts with most of the municipal workforce and with a budget the mayor himself has admitted isn\u2019t exactly as exciting as his previous ones. But when it comes to budgets, as City Hall has also noted, boring can be good. Perhaps the biggest challenge is working with Albany\u2014something Mr. Fuleihan, a former aide to disgraced ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, knows plenty about.\u000a\u000a21. Alicia Glen, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most headline-grabbing challenge of Ms. Glen\u2019s deputy mayorship, shepherding through the mayor\u2019s affordable housing plan, is done now that the plan has been approved. But there will be plenty of work to do make that plan a reality\u2014particularly in the absence of the 421a tax credit that induces so many developers to build. And Ms. Glen will remain a bridge to the real estate types and private companies that play a major role in economic development in the city.\u000a\u000a22. James Malatras, Director of State Operations\u000a\u000aMr. Malatras is Gov. Cuomo\u2019s go-to-guy on policy, and lately it seems like lots of the policies that Mr. Cuomo rolls out focus on New York City. Mr. Malatras is tasked with putting out fires like the one Mr. Cuomo set when he proposed shifting nearly half a billion dollars of costs for CUNY to the city.\u000a\u000a23. George Gresham, 1199SEIU President\u000a\u000aGresham, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, is the unique figure who manages to be on good terms with both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo. As the head of the largest union in the state, he\u2019s been at the forefront of the fight for $15 push and remains maybe the most important New York labor leader out there.\u000a\u000a24. Dean Baquet, Executive Editor of The New York Times\u000a\u000aIf the screaming headlines of the Post or the woodcuts of the Journal aren\u2019t your speed, how about Mr. Baquet\u2019s Grey Lady? As the editor of the Times, Mr. Baquet determines all the news fit to print on politics ranging from City Hall to Albany to the campaign trail. Plenty of reporters have been plucked from local politics beats to chase the presidential candidates\u2014but at the same time, the paper is beefing up its presence in City Hall.\u000a\u000a25. Phil Walzak, Senior Advisor to the Mayor\u000a\u000aAfter a rocky stint as press secretary\u2014a gig that wasn\u2019t quite what he wanted in the first place\u2014Mr. Walzak has settled in as \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the mayor. He still spends a decent amount of his time crafting Mr. de Blasio\u2019s message, at least when he and the mayor aren\u2019t heading off on road trips to watch ballgames.\u000a\u000a26. Jonathan Rosen, Co-Founder ofBerlinRosen\u000a\u000aMr. Rosen, of the PR firm BerlinRosen, is perhaps Mr. de Blasio\u2019s best-known outside consultant\u2014but the mayor\u2019s relationship with Mr. Rosen and others has been gaining greater scrutiny. Mr. Rosen is not a lobbyist and as such does not have to disclose his meetings with the mayor, but his firm represents a slew of boldfaced names that have major business at City Hall. BerlinRosen also handles the mayor\u2019s nongovernmental press, putting out his message as Mr. de Blasio continually tries to influence national politics and spinning on issues like his campaign contributions.\u000a\u000a27. Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of Teachers\u000a\u000aWhile the UFT originally backed former comptroller Bill Thompson, Mr. Mulgrew came around pretty quickly to Mr. de Blasio: The union was the first to ink a new contract with City Hall, and from there Mr. Mulgrew hasn\u2019t looked back. He\u2019s been a frequent visitor to City Hall and a loud defender of the mayor. That must be a welcome change for Mr. Mulgrew after 12 years of being frozen out by Mr. Bloomberg.\u000a\u000a28. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u000a\u000aMr. Dimon is the head of one of those big banks Bernie Sanders is always talking about breaking up, so unsurprisingly he doesn\u2019t think doing so is a great idea. He remains a powerful representative of Wall Street\u2014which is something of an industry non grata in this election cycle but has long held sway over New York\u2019s elected officials, especially Mr. Schumer, to whom Mr. Dimon has donated plenty.\u000a\u000a29. Scott Stringer, Comptroller\u000a\u000aMr. Stringer was among the first city Democratic pols to start going after Mr. de Blasio, and as others have joined in, he\u2019s remained a loud voice thanks to his ability to turn out audits and run investigations. Is it all part of a lead-up to challenging Mr. de Blasio in 2017? It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Stringer is willing to take that risk, but he\u2019s clearly intending to set himself up as a critical voice and perhaps an alternative.\u000a\u000a30. Bill Lipton and Dan Cantor, Co-Founders of the Working Families Party\u000a\u000aAfter backing Mr. Cuomo in 2014 and pissing off its base, the progressive party is getting a redo by going all-in on Bernie Sanders, even as the New York Democratic establishment (and many WFP allies) unite around Ms. Clinton. Were Mr. Sanders to exceed expectations on April 19, expect plenty of accolades for the two men, who have made the labor-backed party a force in New York.\u000a\u000a31. Letitia James, Public Advocate\u000a\u000aThe public advocate has sought to bring her legal experience to the role, filing a slew of lawsuits against various city agencies. Several of them have been tossed out, but that hasn\u2019t slowed down Ms. James\u2019 brand of agitating against the city while also being careful not to do much damage to her friend, Mr. de Blasio. Ms. James has also made a habit of traveling all across the city for events like town halls\u2014a move that might help boost her numbers when she runs for re-election (or perhaps for a higher office).\u000a\u000a32. Shola Olatoye, NYCHA Chairwoman\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of tough jobs in city government, but leading the city\u2019s aging public housing system has got to be one of the very toughest. Ms. Olatoye is tasked with trying to find a way to make the New York City Housing Authority solvent again, and she\u2019ll seek to do so through the Next Generation NYCHA proposal, a controversial plan to lease green space on NYCHA property to private developers.\u000a\u000a33. Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ SEIU\u000a\u000aMr. Figueroa was another player in the major effort to increase the minimum wage in the state, first for fast food workers and then for everyone. He\u2019s also an outspoken advocate of immigration reform and gatekeeper of a union of largely Latino membership that helps sway local elections and endorsed Ms. Clinton for president.\u000a\u000a34. Julissa Ferreras, City Councilwoman\u000a\u000aThe chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s finance committee keeps a relatively low profile, but the Queens lawmaker is quietly one of the most influential council members and a candidate to replace Melissa Mark-Viverito as speaker. Were she to take the reins in 2018, she\u2019d be an automatic mayoral contender.

aVCould Ruth Negga pull an upset on Sunday night at the Academy Awards? The Ethiopian-Irish actress doesn\u2019t have her knickers in a twist over it \u2013 the stunningLoving lead, 35, is on a collision course with stardom and, win or lose, doors are swinging open in Hollywood. The petite actress removed her Prada heels and dug in with the Observer to discuss her extraordinarily ordinary heroine. Mildred Loving, a modest Black woman who married a white man in 1958 and courageously battled the Virginia anti-miscegenation laws for love, equity and the fundamental right for a man and a woman to have a family in the United States.\u000a\u000aWould you call yourself brave?\u000a\u000aRuth Negga: Definitely not. I\u2019m the scaredy-est cat I know. I would hope I\u2019d be brave and that in certain situations, when it would call for it, that I would stand up. But am I tough? I can be quite tough \u2013 but it\u2019s not angry small women\u2019s syndrome.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not?\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not. When you\u2019re small and people address you in that patronizing way, and you think please don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t think being brave and being tough are necessarily mutually exclusive, but you can be either or in certain situations. No one is any one trait 24/7. In order to be brave you need to understand what it is to be fearful. Isn\u2019t that what they say?\u000a\u000aDo you consider Mildred Loving brave?\u000a\u000aAbsolutely! I think she\u2019s brave, but I don\u2019t know if Mildred thought that she was brave. And I can only access that. I had to leave my thoughts out, because I was playing her. For Mildred, she was just pursuing her right to justice. I don\u2019t think she thought it would take nine years. Can you imagine? Every step of the way, she was just doing, and I think sometimes just getting on with things and doing are extraordinary acts of bravery.\u000a\u000aCan you elaborate?\u000a\u000aAnyone who\u2019s had to confront a situation where they feel like they had to fight a little harder, or overcome obstacles, it becomes second nature. Nothing\u2019s going to be handed to you, so in a weird way, you develop this amazing not even a work ethic, but you\u2019re like a Duracell battery. You\u2019ll outlast everyone. You have the ability \u2013you just need the opportunity. The opportunities have to be there. That\u2019s all that people need.\u000a\u000aWhen did opportunity first knock in your own career?\u000a\u000aI was very lucky to get a job right out of college in Dublin [Trinity College\u2019s The Samuel Beckett Centre]. Just before I graduated, Annie Ryan cast me as the title character in a stage version of Nabokov\u2019s Lolita. It\u2019s one of my favorite books. It\u2019s amazing and horrifying \u2014 and this was amazing and horrifying.\u000a\u000aDo you see the lover and the monster in the lecherous character Humbert Humbert, who would now likely be on the sex offender registry?\u000a\u000aIt scares us because we see that those things can live side by side within certain people. It\u2019s scary because we don\u2019t want to know that we can be capable of grotesque acts. I think we\u2019re desperate, aren\u2019t we, to iron out nuances and complexities in life because we think it makes life more palatable. But, in fact, it\u2019s just making it more difficult because it\u2019s luring us down the primrose path, which is wrong. It means that we understand each other less and less and ourselves less and less, because if we forgo the nuance, then we\u2019re just not going to make any progress.\u000a\u000aYou definitely explore the dark side in your violent, volatile comic-book anti-heroine Tulip O\u2019Hare in the AMC TV series Preacher.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s something grotesque about Tulip. I wanted her face to even be grotesque sometimes. But still be peculiarly magnetic and sexy and, like, everything that women are rarely allowed to be on our screens \u2014 because we are in real life. Like me and my girls, like we were all of those things. I I thought I\u2019d like to contribute to that broadening of female roles. Tulip\u2019s fun and she\u2019s feisty. And then she\u2019s not so fun and she\u2019s not so feisty. I embrace the complexity and nuances \u2014 and that she\u2019s funny. I find her funny.\u000a\u000aOne of your signature qualities is large expressive eyes out of proportion to your frame.\u000a\u000aI have a real sticky face. I have no poker face. It\u2019s actually handy being an actress, though. I\u2019ll take the lack of poker face.\u000a\u000aWhat did you take away from living in Mildred\u2019s shoes?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think I can sum it up in a sentence, really. I think that anyone who worked on this film surrounded by those two people, Mildred and Richard Loving, can\u2019t help but find their goodness infectious, and aspirational. I think I\u2019ve internalized it for my heart. Mildred\u2019s still there. Some characters stay with you for a while; others, I find their scent gets less strong. Some people are forever etched into you.\u000a\u000aLike Mildred Loving?\u000a\u000aVery much so.

aVIf you ask Alison Brie, pro wrestling\u2014that confounding mix of live theater, improv, athletics and body oil\u2014can be summed up in three words. \u201cTuck your chin,\u201d she says, in the infectiously high-spirited voice that spawned a voiceover career to rival the Community and Mad Men star\u2019s live-action resume. \u201cTuck your chin, always. Or else you slam the back of your head. In more complicated moves, you can break your neck. So tuck your chin. It\u2019s the key to everything we learned.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow, exactly, did straight-A Annie Edison come to be an expert in safely slamming onto a canvas? The answer is GLOW, a new Netflix original from Liz Flahive and Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan that chronicles the rise in the 1980s of the real-life upstart organization known as the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (if you don\u2019t have time for Brett Whitcomb\u2019s stellar documentary, settle for this 15-minute montage of every G.L.O.W. wrestler\u2019s signature rap intro and remember to thank me later). Brie stars as Ruth, a struggling, out-of-work actress who finds purpose, and a steady gig, inside the squared circle.\u000a\u000aLike wrestling itself, GLOW is a lot of things at once. An ensemble comedy dressed up in spandex. A meditation on the strength of the female body. A look at what\u2019s changed about racism and sexism since the 1980s and, more importantly, what has remained exactly the same.\u000a\u000aHonestly, define GLOW how you\u2019d like. Just don\u2019t use the word \u201cfake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018Fake.\u2019 That is the biggest misconception about pro wrestling,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cSo many people have asked me \u2018but the ring is basically a trampoline, right?\u2019 No. No! It\u2019s planks of wood that have a little give with metal in between. I have such a deep respect for it now. For the athleticism, for the showmanship. I certainly get very defensive when people use \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018pro wrestling\u2019 in the same sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer voice drops, becoming far more Macho Man Randy Savage than Vincent Adultman. \u201cI\u2019m immediately like, \u2018I will take you down!\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat deep respect came courtesy of a four-week crash course prior to production that saw the entire cast\u2014including American Gods MVP Betty Gilpin and resident Mr. Robot hacker Sunita Mani\u2014learning lockups and back bumps from Chavo Guerrero Jr. of the generation-spanning Guerrero wrestling dynasty. It was, Brie says, as grueling as it was emotional; by the time production began, GLOW\u2019s cast was bonded by a shared desire not to drop a co-star on her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of wrestling is about working together, and nurturing your partner. Their life is in your hands as much as yours is in theirs. And there\u2019s a big leap between learning and \u2018now you just sort of have to do the moves,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cYou can only really talk through this stuff for so long until it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., flip over and land on your back.\u2019 There\u2019s really not a halfway version of that.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s another key thing,\u201d she continues, practically a seasoned ring veteran speaking to a rookie. \u201cCommitment in the ring. When you go halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the course our conversation it became clear that professional wrestling\u2014\u201creal\u201d or not\u2014has more in common with Hollywood than you would imagine. The bruises, the boiling down to barest stereotypes, even the occasional spandex requirement. If you go to become an actor halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u000a\u000aTo nab the role of Ruth in GLOW, Brie went anything but halfway.\u000a\u000aWhen Community concluded after six seasons (but no movie), the actress took a full year to read a pile of network pilots but finding nothing to pique her interest. \u201cA lot of the characters I was getting sent for network TV seemed very similar to parts I\u2019ve played before,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted different. \u2018Unique\u2019 was the main word I kept stressing to people.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe parallels to GLOW\u2019s Ruth\u2014an actress searching not just for work but also an identity change, saved by the sudden appearance of a wrestling show\u2014are uncanny, right down to the fact that the studio and producers wanted nothing to do with her. \u201cOf course, the show I\u2019d found and really wanted to do, they didn\u2019t want me for, at all,\u201d Brie says and laughs. \u201cIn fact, I think they were against it. Not only were they not certain, they were adamantly against me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they thought I was edgy enough,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve played these real apple pie characters. I look a certain way. I was looking to change the dialogue about the work I was doing, but they were not privy to that information. So they looked at my résumé and went, \u2018That is not what we\u2019re picturing.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aBrie disagreed. While GLOW\u2019s creative department saw Mad Men\u2019s Trudy Campbell and heard Unikitty from The Lego Movie, the actress herself had a different picture in her head, a fighter with big hair and bigger biceps similar to Sigourney Weaver in Alien (once Brie was cast, she actually did bring a photo of Ripley to hair department head Theraesa Rivers). And she fought. First, to simply get into the audition room, then across several follow-ups with producers Kohan and Flahive, a sojourn to Toronto to get on tape with Gilpin and a return trip Los Angeles for yet another round of auditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was like \u2018pre-read? Yeah! I\u2019ll be there. Anything. I\u2019ll record myself on tape. Whatever,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cI think at every point they could feel my desperation growing.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs luck would have it, desperation is a staple of Ruth\u2019s personality\u2014of every character on GLOW, in her own way. \u201cRuth is a person who was just tired of feeling invisible,\u201d Brie says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more like Ruth than while I was auditioning for the show. And they saw it. I\u2019ve heard [Liz Flahive] and [executive-producer Carly Mensch] say it: \u2018We were watching you transform into the character as you were fighting for the show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAs it turns out, the Ruth we get through GLOW\u2019s debut season could only be played by Brie, and the show would tell a different story without her. The actress remembers something Flahivi told her, before they had even met in person. \u201cShe said, \u2018this is a show about women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 \u201d Which is true; GLOW\u2019s cast runs the gamut\u2014color, size, shape\u2014of what a woman can look like. To position Brie, smallest of them all, at the center says a good deal about the relationship between a person\u2019s size and their capacity to stay strong.\u000a\u000aWhich didn\u2019t make the bumps feel better. But it helped.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wrestling really became all about fearlessness,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hesitate. You had to just make a decision and do it, do things that were very scary for all of us. But being forced to overcome those fears in an instant, essentially in front of a group of strangers, really empowered all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aSound advice, for anyone looking to leap into the rigorous trials of Hollywood or simply dive off the top turnbuckle. It\u2019s about fearlessness.\u000a\u000aJust remember to tuck your chin.

aVWhen Prince Harry swept actress girlfriend Meghan Markle away to celebrate her 36th birthday, rumors started flying that the two would get engaged. But when they arrived back home, there was no ring to be seen. Still, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there was no proposal\u2026\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s entirely possible the pair did get engaged, but are keeping the news under wraps. After all, they will plan the announcement out, down to the last detail, and Kensington Palace will issue the final edict. Unfortunately, there will be no cheesy Facebook engagement photos to judge or elaborate New York Times announcement to howl over. Instead, if Prince William and Kate Middleton are an example, there will simply be a short press release announcing a broad date for the forthcoming wedding.\u000a\u000aFor a little foresight, think all the way back to 2010, when the original royal couple announced their long awaited engagement. Keep in mind, Prince Harry and his current girlfriend have only been dating a little over a year, which doesn\u2019t exactly make for a required engagement. But the pair are quite a bit older than Kate and Wills were, when they announced their engagement at 28\u2014after eight years of dating.\u000a\u000aThe engagement announcement was followed by a surprisingly in-depth on-camera interview, where Prince William admitted that he originally asked his new fiancée to marry him while the pair were on vacation in Kenya, the month before. \u201cWe had been talking about marriage for a while, so it wasn\u2019t a massively big surprise,\u201d the prince admitted while the woman previously known as \u201cWaity Katie\u201d looked on.\u000a\u000aIf the location sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Prince Harry and Meghan Markle flew to Africa to celebrate her birthday earlier this month, where the pair enjoyed a romantic safari in Botswana.

aVEveryone thinks that dogs worship their owners \u2013 viewing them as gods of some sort. While that may be true in the majority of cases, it isn\u2019t always so. As a veterinarian who has focused on animal behavior and the human/canine bond for 30 years, I can confirm that sometimes, no matter what, a dog and his person just aren\u2019t going to get along.\u000a\u000aTake Ruckus, an adopted Wheaton terrier with an attitude. He pretty much hated his new owner, Rick, and was none too warm and fuzzy with Rick\u2019s wife, Cindy. Although Rick was a terrific guy by human standards, Ruckus gave him hell \u2013 much the same as he had done with his previous male owner. It started slowly with some space guarding and territoriality. It eventually got so bad that Rick had to call on his way home to tell Cindy to confine Ruckus for fear of being attacked.\u000a\u000aTo Ruckus, Rick was persona non grata in his own home. It all ended very badly one day when Ruckus was tied up outside while Rick was mowing the lawn. Ruckus\u2019s constant lunging eventually dislodged the tethering post and he flew at Rick, teeth bared and intent on committing grievous bodily harm. A wrestling match ensued; the police and animal control were called while Rick hung on with Ruckus in a choke hold. You really don\u2019t want to know how this story ended: not well for Ruckus, I\u2019m afraid.\u000a\u000aRick adored Ruckus, but it was one-way love. Ruckus truly hated him and engaged in what I called unidirectional aggression. I later found out that unidirectional aggression is a recognized entity in people as well as other animal species.\u000a\u000aWhile there are dogs like Ruckus who frankly dislike their owner, there are others who get no pleasure out of living under the same roof as them. They merely tolerate certain people because they have no other choice. After adoption, these hapless hounds just find themselves having to endure uninteresting or punitive owners. Some withdraw and remain in a permanent funk. Others simply accept this shoddy treatment as the norm and carry on as best they can.\u000a\u000aIn some cases, the dog may have good reason to be nonplussed with his owner: mistreatment will weaken and even seriously damage the human-animal bond. For example, a Brittany intended for hunting was constantly being trained by his owner using an electric shock collar. One day, the dog hid from him and lay quaking under the bed. When the man tried to drag him out, the dog bit him. You could say the man got his just desserts. The behavior the dog showed was fear aggression \u2013 directed toward the owner.\u000a\u000aCuriously, this direct association between harsh treatment by an owner would not explain Ruckus\u2019 situation because Rick never mistreated him. It seems most likely that Ruckus had been seriously abused by a man in the critical period of his development \u2013 certainly the within the first three to four months of life \u2013 and he never forgot it (almost like PTSD).\u000a\u000aA German shepherd I wrote about in my book \u201cThe Dog Who Loved Too Much\u201d was fearful of, but not aggressive to, his male owner. In this case, similar to the Ruckus situation, it was not what the male owner had done to the dog but what other men had done to the dog previously that carried over as a dislike of all men.\u000a\u000aBut this dog\u2019s reaction was not proactive and aggressive like Ruckus\u2019. Rather, it manifest as pure fear with no aggression \u2013 probably because of the dog\u2019s naturally retiring temperament. When the man came home, the dog ran and hid and never appeared again until he left. The dog did not interact with him at all \u2013 except under one discrete circumstance.\u000a\u000aWhen the man\u2019s wife, a diabetic, became hypoglycemic at night (a very dangerous situation), the dog would run to the husband\u2019s side of the bed and tug at the bedclothes until he woke up and realized the problem. The dog\u2019s love for the wife caused him to overcome his fear and summon help when it was really needed. Bravery is not about having no fear but having the grit to fight through it. By this standard, the dog was as brave as they come \u2013 although he still would have preferred that the male owner did not exist at all.\u000a\u000aSo when you hear about dogs being \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d and supplying \u201cunconditional love\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s true only if the person adopts a compatible pet and invests time and attention, showing the dog it\u2019s understood and appreciated. Long walks, plenty of fun, regular meals, clear communication, good leadership and affection should create the dog of everyone\u2019s dreams.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s another instance where \u201cthe love you take is equal to the love you make,\u201d to quote the Beatles. Mean-spirited owners, or those who have been duped into using punitive training methods, do not enjoy the wonderful bond that can exist \u2013 and their dogs do not appreciate them either.\u000a\u000aNicholas Dodman is a Professor Emeritus of Behavioral Pharmacology and Animal Behavior in the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University.

aVEvery internet user (especially photographers and journalists) has encountered visible watermarks, the logos and patterns overlaid on digital stock photos to protect copyrights. It\u2019s long been assumed that these marks protect the photos from being used in unauthorized or unlicensed ways.\u000a\u000aBut Google recently discovered a hack that automatically removes watermarks, giving users unobstructed access to copyrighted images. The good news is the company also figured out a way to stop it.\u000a\u000aResearchers Tali Dekel, Michael Rubenstein, Ce Liu and William T. Freeman made their work public this week in a post on Google\u2019s blog, an academic paper and a video.\u000a\u000aWatermarks purposely feature complex structures like thin lines and shadows to make it harder for computers to figure out where the mark ends and the actual image begins. Indeed, even a Photoshop expert with the most up-to-date tools needs almost 10 minutes to remove just one watermark.\u000a\u000aBut the Google team realized that the same watermark is often embedded in many images at one time. That means a hacker who knows the relative properties of each image can accurately recover the watermark pattern and reverse the process, revealing the original images. This hack can be performed automatically with no user intervention.\u000a\u000aSo how can companies like Shutterstock and Adobe combat this problem? Simply put, by making watermarks more complicated. That doesn\u2019t just mean changing their position, but rather introducing random geometric patterns to \u201cwarp\u201d the image and make the marks inconsistent. Even the subtlest change generates watermarks that can\u2019t be hacked or fully removed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile we cannot guarantee that there will not be a way to break such randomized watermarking schemes in the future, we believe (and our experiments show) that randomization will make watermarked collection attacks fundamentally more difficult,\u201d the researchers conclude.\u000a\u000aYou can read the team\u2019s full paper (submitted to the Computer Vision Foundation) for more mathematical and technical details.

aVAn action-thriller without any thrills is like a Big Mac without the cheese. Bushwick, by the director team Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott (Cooties) is a noisy duh-and-so-what effort that pretends to be shot in one continual take (sorry boys, you can see the camera cuts) but seems to drag on for days.\u000a\u000aIn the opening shot, a couple walks through a deserted subway station on their way to the girl\u2019s grandmother in Brooklyn, wondering where everybody has gone. Suddenly a cloaked figure dashes through the tunnel in flames. On their way out, they hear sirens and helicopters circling overhead. The boy is machine-gunned down, and once she reaches the street, the girl, whose name is Lucy, is tackled and handcuffed by a man wearing a mask, who is then massacred himself by artillery fire from a passing car. Martial law has been declared, but why? Shortly after, the girl is befriended by a tough Marine named Stupe who reluctantly lets her tag along as he tries to make his way to Hoboken. The movie has only been running a few minutes, and already it\u2019s as dopey as a dwarf who escaped from Snow White. It takes almost an hour before Lucy (Brittany Snow) and Stupe (Dave Bautista) learn what all the violence, panic and bloodshed is about. Are you sitting down? In the brain-dead script by Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, it appears that Texas has decided to secede from the union, and all of the other Southern states have joined the Lone Star state in support, forming something called the New American Coalition, to invade Northern cities like New York in support. In the massive war that ensues, the body count rises. Needless to say, Lucy never reaches her destination to find out if her grandmother is dead or alive; instead, she spends the rest of the movie ripping glass splinters out of her companion\u2019s back and sewing him up with string, rescuing a herd of innocent victims hiding out in a church with the aid of a gang of killers (she needs their guns), and following her military Marine Corps protector through the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, dodging bullets, rapists, and marauding armies of mercenaries with accents that sound like the cast of the Beverly Hillbillies. They bandage each other\u2019s wounds. A sniper blows one of her fingers off. Already preposterous as a 19-dollar bill, the movie turns hilarious when Lucy enters a store that is being looted where she pauses to listens to a radio announcer who promises an address by Donald Trump. In the end, there\u2019s nobody left alive, including the president of (what is left of) the good old U.S.A. The demilitarized zone is somewhere in Queens.\u000a\u000aBUSHWICK \u2605\u000a\u000a(1/4 stars)\u000a\u000aDirected by: Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott\u000a\u000aWritten by: Nick Damici and Graham Reznick\u000a\u000aStarring: Dave Bautista, Brittany Snow, Christian Navarro and Arturo Castro\u000a\u000aRunning time: 93 mins.\u000a\u000aWhere do they think up this stuff? The screenplay promises more excitement than it delivers, fails to develop characters beyond their most tertiary identities, and belly-flops even as political satire. The actors struggle to keep the audience awake, but it\u2019s hard to work up much concern for people you never know anything about. With the problems of racist brutality in the current construct, somebody must have considered tapping into the moral and ethical divisiveness rampant in America today a political challenge that goes great with popcorn. Instead, it just seems exaggerated and silly. Maybe there\u2019s an idea rattling around in here somewhere, but I\u2019d like to see it in a better movie than Bushwick.

aVWine devotees from all over the world flock to America\u2019s preeminent wine region, Napa. Though quite small in size compared to other major wine-producing meccas, the valley is brimming with exquisite vineyards. To match, is a burgeoning restaurant scene (complimented by the fact that The Culinary Institute at Greystone has based itself there). In 2016, the area counted 3.5 million visitors making their pilgrimages to wine country, who spent over $1.9 billion. You can find excellent wine at many of Napa\u2019s vineyards, but a true treat is an expert pairing to accompany an exquisite meal. Here are Napa\u2019s top five dining destinations.\u000a\u000aOne of the unique aspects of the #WineTrain is the four-star dining on our restaurant on wheels. Our culinary team crafts creative and delicious bites to complement our diverse tours. Come on board and dig into food and wine wonder! Book at winetrain.com #AllAboard A post shared by Napa Valley Wine Train (@winetrain) on Jul 12, 2017 at 10:14am PDT\u000a\u000aThere are multiple ways to get to Napa, but if you\u2019re looking to start the fun before you even set foot in the region you may want to consider the Napa Valley Wine Train. Catch the ferry from San Francisco to Valejo and then hop on the shuttle to the train station, where you board the picture perfect 100-year old Pullman railcar. You\u2019ll feel like you are in a scene from Murder on the Orient Express, except with less murder and a whole lot more pinot noir. Speedy the train is not, but the meals are gourmet, and you can actually view the chefs making your food in the kitchen cart. The ride offers vistas of some of the most beautiful vineyards in Napa, Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford and St. Helena. You can select different packages for your travel, but the one that brings you to Castello di Amorosa is considered by many the best option. The most ideal way to begin any tour is with a big, beautiful castle, after all. Even though this 13th-century style palazzo built by Dario Sattui is less than 20 years old, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re living like Italian nobility. The eight-level structure made of 8,000 tons of hand-squared stone, has 171 acres, 107 rooms (of which 95 are devoted to producing or storing wine), 900 linear feet of caves, a great hall with two-story Italian frescoes, a drawbridge, a dungeon, a torture chamber and a moat. It also has biggest barrel room in the U.S.\u000a\u000aSometime dreams do come true\u2026 Thank you @chefthomaskeller and everyone at #thefrenchlaundry for a night I will never forget. #foodporn #garbagefriends A post shared by Martha MacIsaac (@marthamacisaac) on Jul 9, 2017 at 11:24pm PDT\u000a\u000aAfter wine, restauranteur Thomas Keller might arguably be the second biggest Napa draw. The famous chef literally has a monopoly in Napa with now five Michelin-starred restaurants. The French Laundry and Bouchon Bistro are probably his best known venues, though French Laundry is basically impossible to get a reservation at during the busy season, which is now. Ad Hoc and Addendum is a great, more casual Keller alternative if you want a little barbecue with your wine. But if you can\u2019t get in to French Laundry, you can still always walk around the kitchen\u2019s garden across the street. If you are lucky enough to snag a seat, expect to pay about $310 per head for the nine-course meal. Emma Stone called her recent visit to the restaurant a dream come true.\u000a\u000aThis rich and delicious Duck Rillette recipe was created by Chef Jamie Prouten to accompany our Gravel Lounge charcuterie platter, and also makes an elegant spread for sandwiches, pasta stuffing, or as a dip for crudité! \U0001f60b\U0001f60b\U0001f60b \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 >>Get the recipe at Feedbyroundpond.com << . . #napavalley #visitnapavalley #bloglover #recipe #brunch #winecountry #summer #summer #charcuterie #duck #antipasti #winecountry #roundpondestate A post shared by Round Pond Estate (@roundpondestate) on Aug 20, 2017 at 12:03pm PDT\u000a\u000aIf you are looking for an amazing brunch experience look no farther than Round Pond, a vineyard tucked away behind a palm-tree lined grand driveway that rivals the one in Jurassic Park. The family-owned Rutherford Estate vineyard is as well known for their wine as for their olive oil and red wine vinegar. In addition to its 360 acres of vines, the estate also boasts 12 acres of olive orchards and five acres of organic gardens (if you\u2019re counting). This is perhaps what makes their four-hour garden-to-table Sunday brunch so special\u2014it begins with a tour of the garden led by a winery chef. With your freshly foraged veggies in hand, the next stop is a cooking demonstration, followed by a wine-pairing discussion, and then food is finally delivered. On weekdays you can also stop in for a lovely Il Pranzo lunch and tasting, and perhaps dine on the Duck confit grilled cheese\u2014the way it should always be prepared.\u000a\u000aSummer reservations are now available (through September 2017) via @tockhq.

A post shared by The Restaurant at Meadowood (@therestaurantmw) on Jun 1, 2017 at 11:31am PDT\u000a\u000aIn addition to being an award-winning resort and spa, Meadowood is home to a three-starred Michelin restaurant headed by Christopher Kostow. The genius chef uses local ingredients from the resort\u2019s gardens in the most incendiary ways, but you won\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019ve dined on until after the meal, when the menu is presented (you do get to see the wine menu before the meal, however). You\u2019ll probably want to go for the Chef\u2019s Counter, but the bar menu is a great option as well.

aVIt hasn\u2019t been a good summer for wearable technology: Intel axed its wearables division in July, and a little over a month later, a federal court ruled that workplace wellness programs\u2014many of which rely on wearables like activity trackers for data collection\u2014can no longer be defined as voluntary when employees stand to lose money if they don\u2019t participate. Although this doesn\u2019t have immediate effects on workplace-wellness programs, it could alter the financial terms of how future programs deploy wearables. This is not news wearables needed to hear. As Business of Fashion pointed out in a look at the wearables industry, Intel\u2019s strategy shift could be indicative of a looming crisis for the industry, and a telltale sign of what we already suspected: consumers do not find these products attractive. They report:\u000a\u000aEarly entrant Jawbone, which raised more than $900 million over the course of nearly 20 years and was valued at $3.2 billion in 2014, began liquidation proceedings in June. Then there is Fitbit, which raised $730 million when it went public in June 2015. At the time, it was valued at over $4 billion. Today, the maker of activity-trackers, which acquired smartwatch start-up Pebble\u2019s assets in February for $23 million, is valued at just over $1 billion.\u000a\u000aSo we\u2019re looking at a product category that\u2019s lost at least $3 billion in valuation in the last two years.\u000a\u000aSo what? It\u2019s tough to be sympathetic if the story is that the product doesn\u2019t attract consumers, is not effective at counting calories or motivating people to exercise, and is generally not considered useful.\u000a\u000aBut the real story here is that wearables as we understand them now (crazy-advanced, but ugly watches and tiny sensors in our pockets or bras that require us to log on to the web to manage the data) are basically where mobile phones were pre-iPhone.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not just what the tech can do. It\u2019s what the experience of using the tech is like, and whether the user perceives the tech as expanding the potential for his or her fun, utility or productivity. That\u2019s when the tech becomes transformative.\u000a\u000aWho cares? Women in tech do. The wearables industry is notable because it\u2019s one of the few tech sectors where women comprise a substantial percentage of early founders for hardware start-ups, and they\u2019re still a significant presence in the field. If the press narrative becomes \u201cwearables are in a slump,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t be that hard for someone to decide the problem is not in what the product was, but who was creating it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s tough to get a read on what the gender breakdown is now for tech leads on devices\u2014not only are companies getting acquired, the big guns like Apple got into the market, and the scope of gender bias among workers in tech companies is only now getting sustained attention\u2014but what is apparent is this: There are many vast, not-yet-exhausted markets for wearables, and their success or failure will depend on a tech culture that is not predominantly young and male.\u000a\u000aFor example, elder care wearables are a category some investors and developers are eying\u2014nearly one in five Americans will be a senior citizen by 2030. And while speculation swirls around augmentative wearables, my question is this: Where is the input from home health care aides and nursing home staffers?\u000a\u000aThe elder care wearables I\u2019ve seen personally at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2016 and 2017, plus ones listed in tech news articles, all seem to circle around the premise that senior citizens will retain their faculties, dexterity and autonomy until the day they die. If that were the case, far fewer than 814,000 people would be working as home health aides right now.\u000a\u000aIf you want to find out what kinds of wearables are of use to the elderly, talk to the people who care for the elderly. They\u2019ll be the ones who can tell you what kind of data they need to monitor or what capabilities their patients need to have supplemented.\u000a\u000aAnother area of booming interest to wearables types: the bra. I am not a noble enough person to resist going for the obvious joke here\u2014a tech-bro startup dedicated to a Bluetooth-connected bra that unsnaps itself so nobody has to master the one-handed unhook method!\u2014but let\u2019s all acknowledge it and move on.\u000a\u000aThere are already sports bras that contain heart-rate monitors. There are sports bras that measure all sorts of breathing and heart rate variables to help runners optimize their training. There is a bra in development to monitor breast tissue density and detect lumps. In order for this product category to continue expanding\u2014a smart nursing bra that allows women more control over pumping schedules and maximizing production, a bra to monitor respiration as part of a stress-management strategy, for example\u2014it will need startups, and the people running them, to understand what the market wants, not what the market should want.\u000a\u000aWearable tech does not begin and end with the fitness monitor. In fact, wearing anything at all is a deployment of technology\u2014weatherproofing! sun-blocking! The amazing thing is how that functional technology expanded over time to define and fulfill new requirements, from aesthetics to class signaling. Wiring our attire so its functionality is extended is a logical next step; expect some stumbles until someone develops a product that seems simultaneously natural and new.\u000a\u000aWant more?

aVWhenever there is a major terror attack, it doesn\u2019t take long for President Donald Trump to bring up the story about General John Pershing defeating Muslim insurgents in the Philippines with pork-laced bullets. But the story is more Hollywood than history. Pork is hardly the kryptonite that armchair anti-terrorism experts think it is.\u000a\u000aShortly after the terror attack in Barcelona, in which a terrorist mowed down several people with his car, Trump tweeted, \u201cStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump first brought up Pershing at the South Carolina primary in 2016. According to the Washington Post, Trump said,\u000a\u000a\u201cThey were having terrorism problems, just like we do. And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs\u2019 blood\u2014you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs\u2019 blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And to the 50th person, he said, \u2018You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.\u2019 And for 25 years, there wasn\u2019t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aTexas A&M History Professor Brian McAllister Linn said he heard of the Pershing tale after 9/11 but was unable to find an example of the general using the tactic, according to Time magazine. Politifact checked with eight scholars but couldn\u2019t find support for the tale either.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t a case of the media and academics picking on Trump. The conservative National Review took similar offense at General Pershing being associated with such dirty tactics. As David French writes,\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst, it\u2019s false. There\u2019s no evidence Pershing did such a thing. In fact, he got the history exactly backwards. Pershing worked hard to avoid inflaming religious fanaticism and worked hard to avoid unnecessary loss of life. For example, read this excerpt from a letter Pershing wrote to the insurgents. The language comes from his own memoir: \u2018I write you this letter because I am sorry to know that you and your people refuse to do what the government has ordered. You do not give up your arms. Soldiers were sent to Taglibi so that you could come into camp and turn in your guns. When the soldiers went to camp a Taglibi, your Moros fired into camp and tried to kill the soldiers. Then the soldiers had to shoot all Moros who fired upon them. When the soldiers marched through the country, the Moros again shot at them, so the soldiers had to kill several others. I am sorry the soldiers had to kill any Moros. All Moros are the same to me as my children and no father wants to kill his own children.\u2019 Those are not the words of a man who commits a religious war crime\u2026 Simply put, Trump libeled an American hero, the man who led American troops through the crucible of the First World War.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s story is likely based upon a 1939 movie called The Real Glory. In the film, actor Gary Cooper and his mates battle Muslim insurgents in the Philippines with pork, as some screenwriter no doubt heard that to consume such meat is illegal in Islam. Their plan to bury dead guerrillas in pig skins saves the day, just before the credits roll.\u000a\u000aBut the use of pork-laced bullets, smearing bodies in pork, and burying people in pig skins doesn\u2019t have the chilling effect on terrorists that Americans might expect. In 2002, Israelis tried it to prevent Hamas suicide bombers from attacking. The leaders of this Palestinian terror group claimed that a \u201cmartyr\u201d would get to heaven for his actions\u2014pork or not.\u000a\u000a\u201cPalestinian Muslims reacted with scorn to the idea, saying the soul went to paradise and was unaffected by any taint to the body,\u201dThe Telegraph reported. \u201c \u2018The keys to heaven are not in the hands of settlers,\u2019 said Sheikh Hassan Youssef, for Hamas, whose military wing has sent dozens of suicide bombers into Israel. Islamic reference books say the body of a martyr who dies for the faith is so pure that it does not need to be washed before burial, in contrast to the usual Muslim practice.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt may be comforting to believe that a Muslim driving a truck loaded with explosives toward an American military base would slam on the brakes if a pig\u2019s carcass was hung outside the gates, but such a plan is unlikely to succeed. Bin Laden didn\u2019t surrender in order to avoid a fate in which he would be packed in pork, dead or alive.\u000a\u000aIf America is to prevail against ISIS, a reconstituted al-Qaeda, Hamas, or any other terrorism group, we need a better strategy than made-up tales. Good intelligence, better vigilance, sophisticated technology and building alliances will do better to battle terrorism than bacon.\u000a\u000aJohn A.

aVNew York\u2019s top female Democrats and women\u2019s groups renewed calls for the establishment of a women\u2019s history museum and the need for an Equal Rights Amendment at an event marking the 44th annual Women\u2019s Equality Day.\u000a\u000aAs proposed and passed by both houses of Congress in 1972, the ERA would codify \u201cequal rights under the law\u201d for men and women in the U.S. Constitution, and allow the federal government to pass laws prohibiting sex discrimination in hiring, firing, promotions and benefits. U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney \u2014 who has been a longtime ERA advocate \u2014 and Jessica Neuwirth, president of the Equal Rights Amendment Coalition, drafted an updated version of the amendment and are looking to get the state legislatures to pass and approve it.\u000a\u000aAnd Maloney\u2019s Smithsonian Women\u2019s History Museum Act, which would create a women\u2019s history museum on the National Mall, has the support of the majority of the House of Representatives, with 246 bipartisan co-sponsors.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m gonna continue asking everyone,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how many times they say no. I\u2019m not gonna stop until we pass the National Women\u2019s Museum and until we pass the Equal Rights Amendment. I will continue to ask everyone that we meet today, every elected official, I will continue to ask the president of the United States to stand up and support this amendment.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn addition to the museum, the act establishes an advisory council consisting of 25 members appointed by the Smithsonian Board of Regents to make recommendations concerning planning, design and construction, operations and finances and programming for the museum.\u000a\u000aThe bill is based on the work of the bipartisan American Museum of Women\u2019s History of Congressional Commission created in 2014 to study the need for such a museum through legislation introduced by Maloney and Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, in the House, and former Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, and Maine Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, in the Senate.\u000a\u000aMaloney has said that the amendment\u2019s passage has become more needed due to President Trump\u2019s election. Trump described sexually assaulting women on tape, pushed to defund Planned Parenthood, outlined plans to eliminate grant programs established under the Violence Against Women Act, sought to allow conservative religious groups to become more politically active and expressed interest in seeing the Supreme Court overturn the Roe v. Wade decision.\u000a\u000aLt. Gov. Kathy Hochul reiterated that point, and noted that the right to vote is not the only pressing issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I do not feel he has been fair to women,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cThere are so many instances where, for example, the assault on women\u2019s health care, the Affordable Care Act, that\u2019s talking about rights that we hold dear, the right to have contraceptive access \u2026 that\u2019s under assault under thus administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther attendees included Neuwirth; Manhattan Assemblywoman Rebecca Seawright; Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer; Maya Wiley, board chairwoman of the city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board; the National Organization for Women; and Moms Demand Action.\u000a\u000aJacqueline Ebanks, director of the city\u2019s Commission on Gender Equity, told the Observer that the work of the commission is in line with the effort. And she wants to show Trump and others to understand that women need to be recognized for their contributions to society.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll women are full citizens in this country and all citizens deserve recognition and acknowledgement for the work they have done to make this country what it is and the soul we will do to help build a greater democracy,\u201d Ebanks said. \u201cAnd so we need to be acknowledged but frankly acknowledged or not women have taken their rightful place in this society and will continue to do the job to ensure full equality for all.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith Maskara, CEO of Girl Scouts of Greater New York, spoke of a \u201cleadership crisis,\u201d saying that girls need to know they can be leaders.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn order for them to believe that and to know that, we have to show them that it does exist, it has existed,\u201d Maskara told the Observer.

aVThis Sunday night will see Game of Thrones conclude its seventh season with \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf.\u201d While we have many predictions for the finale, one stands out as the most likely: this episode will set viewership records for Thrones and maybe even HBO.\u000a\u000aTo date, the show\u2019s biggest outing was actually this season\u2019s fifth episode, \u201cEastwatch,\u201d with 10.7 million live viewers, per TV Series Finale. That number broke the record set just one week prior by \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice,\u201d which earned 10.1 million viewers. The biggest season finale in Thrones history came last year in Episode 60, \u201cThe Winds of Winter,\u201d to the tune of 8.889 million live total viewers, according to TheWrap.\u000a\u000aSince the show debuted in 2011, it has consistently added legions of fans every year, a feat made more impressive when you remember how competitive and time consuming the Peak TV era really is. Other mega hits such as AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead and FOX\u2019s Empire have seen a decline in viewers as the seasons have marched by. But Thrones just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Last Sunday\u2019s penultimate episode, which we found somewhat underwhelming, garnered 10.2 million live viewers.\u000a\u000aHere are the ratings for the show\u2019s previous six season finales, per TheWrap.\u000a\u000aSeason 1: 3.041 million total viewers\u000a\u000aSeason 2: 4.202 million\u000a\u000aSeason 3: 5.393 million\u000a\u000aSeason 4: 7.093 million\u000a\u000aSeason 5: 8.112 million\u000a\u000aSeason 6: 8.889 million\u000a\u000aGiven the show\u2019s massive cultural footprint and its steady increase in finale ratings, don\u2019t be surprised to see \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf\u201d top the 11 million mark. This would also mark a network high for HBO.

aVThe University of Arkansas announced Wednesday that it was the recipient of a $120 million donation from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation\u2014a charity started by the family of Walmart founders Sam and Helen Walton\u2014to establish the first ever dedicated art school in the state.\u000a\u000aThe gift is the \u201clargest ever given to a U.S. university in support of or to establish a school of art,\u201d according to an announcement on the University\u2019s website. The new school will open inside the University\u2019s J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences at the University, and feature a special focus on the study of American art and the art of the Americas, according to University of Arkansas chancellor Joseph E. Steinmetz. Additionally, the art school\u2019s programming will run in close conjunction with another Walton family venture: The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe newly endowed School of Art will transform the university and region into an international hub for the study of art,\u201d said Steinmetz in a statement. \u201cThe School of Art will also have an immediate, resounding positive effect on the culture of our entire state, and its imprint will be seen across the nation and beyond.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the school\u2019s relationship with the Crystal Bridges Museum, which is located in Bentonville and founded by Walmart heiress Alice Walton, Steinmetz said: \u201cWith an emphasis on cross-disciplinary collaborations and signature outreach efforts with the museum, and a focus on student, faculty and staff diversity, the school will be uniquely positioned to develop programs to rival the top competitors in the field.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the College of Arts and Sciences currently has department of art offering Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts degree programs, as well as an MFA program, the art school will offer additional degree programs in graphic design as well as doctorates in art history and arts education, reports The Art Newspaper. The new art school will be \u201cphased in,\u201d according to the school\u2019s announcement, over the course of five years.\u000a\u000aThe $120 million gift directly supports funding for scholarships, travel and internships, partnerships with Crystal Bridges and other local arts organizations, the creation of additional graduate degree programs and the renovation of of the Fine Arts Center, according the University\u2019s announcement.\u000a\u000aThe Walton Family Foundation\u2019s Crystal Bridges Museum, which was founded in 2005 by its current board of directors chair Alice Walton, is known for its expansive collection of American art and contemporary building designed by Moshe Safdie to hover over twin ponds. On the formation of the University of Arkansas\u2019 art school, Walton said in a statement: \u201cThe School of Art will shape a new generation of artists, historians, designers and teachers with a unique understanding of the hope art can bring to communities\u2026 The unparalleled access to meaningful American art will connect the heartland to the world.\u201d

aVThe NJ Sharing Network Foundation is welcoming Yvonne Payne of Teaneck to its Board of Trustees \u2013 two years after she received a life-saving heart transplant.\u000a\u000aPayne eagerly looks for opportunities to honor the memory of child actress Sammi Kane Kraft, whose tragic death in a 2012 California car crash meant a new heart and a new chance at life for Payne.\u000a\u000aPayne lead a team at NJ Sharing Network\u2019s 5K Walk and USATF-Certified Race on June 8, raising thousands of dollars for the life-saving mission.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am touched by the entire NJ Sharing Network organization,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI definitely want to help out and ensure as many people as possible know the importance of registering for organ donation, especially in the Black and Latino communities. I want to share my story with others and hope they can support this beautiful organization.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayne \u2013 wife of Fox Business Network contributor Charles Payne \u2013 is inspired by her heart donor, Sammi Kane Kraft. Kraft, whose real-life baseball skills landed her the starring role as a spunky pitching ace in the 2005 remake of \u201cBad News Bears,\u201d died Oct. 9, 2012, at the age of 20.\u000a\u000aFour days later, Payne underwent heart transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Today, the lively 56-year-old Teaneck woman is determined to give back something tangible to other people in need \u2013 including her service to the Foundation.\u000a\u000aPayne recalls an \u201cactive and athletic childhood,\u201d but rheumatic fever at age 13 left her with a weak heart and prone to fatigue due to arrhythmia. \u201cI learned to cope and tried to be as active as possible as a teenager and young adult,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy heart always seemed so noisy in my chest,\u201d she recalled. In her mid-30s Payne was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening rapid heartbeat that ultimately required her to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctors told me I would eventually need a heart transplant. That was a frightening idea, so I kept telling myself and everyone else that I\u2019d be just fine,\u201d Payne said. By 2011, her condition worsened and her bouts of exhaustion became more frequent.\u000a\u000aPhysicians at New York Presbyterian implanted a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in July 2012 to provide temporary relief. \u201cAn LVAD is a bridge-to-a-transplant until a heart is available,\u201d said Payne, noting that her recovery and potentially long wait for a donor brought on \u201cfear and depression.\u201d\u000a\u000aA personal phone call from former Vice President Dick Cheney helped lift Payne\u2019s spirits. \u201cIt meant so much. Mr. Cheney had LVAD surgery too. He told me to have faith, stay strong and leave my depression behind,\u201d said Payne, who had met Cheney once while visiting friends in Wyoming.\u000a\u000aWhile the LVAD helped for a short while, her condition turned critical less than three months later when she developed a blood clot in the LVAD and doctors told her she needed an immediate heart transplant.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also needed a miracle,\u201d Payne said. It came in an emotional phone call from Shelly and Lulu Kane Kraft \u2013 Sammi\u2019s parents and friends of Payne\u2019s husband, Charles. \u201cThey knew about my condition, kept me in their prayers and were calling to say they wanted their daughter\u2019s passing to help me live,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWithin 48 hours, the Paynes flew to Los Angeles and Yvonne underwent transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai. \u201cThe first thing I recall when I woke up after surgery was the quiet. It was the first time my heart was really ever silent,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDirected organ donation, which Payne underwent, is not normal for emergency situations and is considered rare. Most people receive the gift of donation from an anonymous donor. For directed organ donation, blood types must be compatible between donors and intended recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Payne is devoting time and energy to offer hope to others facing heart transplants and making a similar journey through her service with the NJ Sharing Network Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cYvonne\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment is an inspiration to us all,\u201d said Elisse Glennon, executive director, NJ Sharing Network Foundation. \u201cWe are excited to be working with her. She is a dynamic person who will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goals. We are especially pleased about her commitment to outreach to minority communities and look forward to working closely with her in the coming months and years.\u201d

aV\u201cShould I give the benediction?\u201d gallerist Roland Augustine asked the nine of us who had gathered on Saturday morning, Nov. 12, outside Luhring Augustine, the Chelsea gallery he runs with Lawrence Luhring. He laughed. \u201cOn your mark. Get set. Go!\u201d We bounded east on 23rd Street, carrying a thin bouquet of chamomile flowers in our hands, high-fiving Mr. Luhring down the block, and then, following Dutch artist Guido van der Werve, turned left on Sixth Avenue, toward Central Park.\u000a\u000aMr. van der Werve, 34, outfitted in a black shirt, shorts and knee-high compression socks, was leading us to the grave of Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, in Valhalla, New York, a 30-mile trek, for his Performa 11 work. (Chamomiles are Russia\u2019s native flower.) The last time we ran more than 10 miles was about a year ago, and as we ran we realized that trying to participate was a very poor decision.\u000a\u000aAfter winding through Central Park, finishing six miles, most of the runners had given up and Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson (also a Luhring Augustine artist), who had made part of the journey on a trusty folding bicycle, decided to quit. We were beginning to feel rather fatigued. Mr. van der Werve, however, felt great. A few months earlier he had run 60 miles around his house (for an art piece), and he had made a 28-mile version of the run to the grave last year, leaving from MoMA P.S.1 as part of his participation in that museum\u2019s \u201cGreater New York\u201d exhibition.\u000a\u000aAlong with the artist and another writer, Reid Singer (who had run the New York City Marathon the previous weekend, and is thus completely, charmingly insane), we wound our way up through Harlem and the Bronx and Mount Vernon. We entered Yonkers, and passed Sarah Lawrence College. \u201cIf you keep up this pace, you will run a four-hour marathon,\u201d Mr. van der Werve told us encouragingly.\u000a\u000aThen, at mile 20, our knee felt like it was about to pop off. It was unpleasant. So we stopped, and followed the rest of the run in an SUV that Luhring Augustine had rented. Mr. van der Werve looked entirely relaxed as he cruised along with Mr. Singer, and they picked up the pace a bit after graciously running at a somewhat reduced speed to accommodate your author.\u000a\u000aA few days earlier, at the Trestle on Tenth restaurant in Chelsea, we had asked Mr. van der Werve how the inaugural Rachmaninoff run came about for the P.S.1 exhibition. \u201cThe other idea was climbing the height of Mount Everest on a step ladder,\u201d he explained. \u201cI tried it for about three hours, just to test it, but that turned out to be impossible, at least for me.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. van der Werve, who has composed music for many of his films, said that he had once read that when Rachmaninoff died in 1943, World War II prevented his body from being returned to Europe, and so he ended up being buried in Westchester. \u201cHe seemed kind of lonely there,\u201d he proposed. \u201cNo one knows he is there. Chopin is in Père Lachaise, with Jim Morrison and other famous people.\u201d (For a future project, he is planning a 1,000-mile triathlon between Paris to Warsaw, where Chopin\u2019s heart is buried supposedly buried, having been secreted out of France by his sister.)\u000a\u000aWe asked him why he likes to run, admitting that we tend to picture artists smoking and drinking. He explained, \u201cI\u2019ve done that a lot, as well, but I tend to get hooked on things, and I figured it was better to get hooked on a running addiction than anything else. For any artist, or anyone who has to structure their own time, it\u2019s very easy to turn around a point for a long time, so to say,\u201d he continued, between sips of espresso.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of what I do is trying to come up with new ideas for films or music, so it can be hard. Running is a great way to get sharp,\u201d he told us. In Berlin, he has started \u201ca little running club. The Berlin Artist Running Foundation, or BARF. We have about 20 members, but it\u2019s hard to organize artists. What I do is, when I am going to run\u201d\u2014he runs five or six days a week\u2014\u201cI post it on a Facebook page. Sometimes people show up. Usually no one shows up.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cMany times, when you know you\u2019re going to have a bad day, it\u2019s nice to go for a run.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is hard to imagine Mr. van der Werve having a bad day. Relaxed and cheerful, he jumped from one story and anecdote to another during our talk (and during the run)\u2014telling us the source of the brand name Asics, the history of freestyle swimming and how much he liked The Book of Mormon when he saw it with colleagues from the gallery earlier in the week. But there is a sadness\u2014a Romantic melancholy\u2014in much of his work.\u000a\u000aOne film shows a man\u2014the artist\u2014walking alone on a wide expanse of ice, just yards away from a huge ice-clearing ship that is bearing down beside him. In another, he acquires a Steinway grand piano and performs Chopin\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 (he once trained to be a classic pianist) cramped inside his Amsterdam apartment with a sizable orchestra. The piano is then repossessed by the company.\u000a\u000aMore than five and a half hours after we began, we met Messrs. van der Werve and Singer in Kensico Cemetery. (It had taken a bit longer than expected, the artist explained alter, because the route\u2013judging by his GPS watch\u2013had ended up being 33 miles, not the expected 30.) Each laid his flowers on the grave, concluding one of the more bizarre, elegantly simple pieces of durational performances we have ever seen. We had been invited along on the journey, an equal with the artist, but failed. No need to worry, he explained, the run will be an annual tradition\u000a\u000aBack in the SUV, returning to Manhattan, we asked Mr. van der Werve how he expected to feel the next day. \u201cWe all may be a bit immobile,\u201d he said.

aVAcademy Award nominated filmmaker George Lucas is the newest celeb resident of a small town in the south of France. The Star Wars creator, it has now been revealed, is the buyer of a historic chateau in the Var region of Provence.\u000a\u000aChâteau Margüi is a massive 253-acre estate, and is known for the famous vineyard, located on the property. It\u2019s now the newest addition to Lucas\u2019 Skywalker Vineyards collection, which produces vino in California and Italy.\u000a\u000aLucas is following in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, who purchased Château Miraval, an estate just south of Château Margüi, in 2008. The former couple paid nearly $67 million for the historic property, and held their wedding there in August 2014. Pitt and Jolie announced their separation almost one year ago, but they\u2019re still attached to Miraval.\u000a\u000aLucas paid $11.2 million for his chateau in April of this year. The vineyard at Château Margüi has produced award winning rosés in the past, as well as red and white wines, which are more difficult to grow in this particular region. Aside from the 33-acres dedicated to vineyards, the property also has orchards, a vegetable garden and olive groves.\u000a\u000aThe sprawling estate includes an 18th century chateau as well as a Roman chapel, multiple houses and also \u201ctechnical\u201d buildings, all of which were renovated sometime in the last twenty years.\u000a\u000aAside from the vino, Lucas is also apparently planning on building a small hotel on the property, and per People, has already received planning permission to embark on that project. The pricy renovations and additions will cost approximately $17.7 million, and the full-time staff on the estate will grow from three to 15.\u000a\u000aHopefully, Lucas\u2019 planned renovations go more smoothly than Pitt and Jolie\u2018s at Chateau Miraval. The exes are currently involved in a legal battle with a French designer, who is claiming payments for work gradually halted for no apparent reason\u2014after three years in court, Pitt and Jolie have reportedly been ordered by a French court to pay approximately $590,000.

aVIn the expanding genre of gay cinema, coming out dramas are now yesterday\u2019s mashed potatoes. A lot of things about the arresting dynamics of Beach Rats\u2014a sad, thoughtful look at the life after high school of a bored, directionless Brooklyn teenager searching for sexual identity on the brink of manhood\u2014make this a film worthy of special attention. But the most memorable thing about it is the profoundly understated sensitivity of Harris Dickinson, a (surprisingly) British actor to keep an eye on. It\u2019s the best career-making debut since Lucas Hedges in Manchester by the Sea. He may have been trained in a London drama school, but his hesitant, awkward accent is as natural to the far shores of Brooklyn as the Coney Island boardwalk, where his character, Frankie, spends most of his time.\u000a\u000aWritten and directed by Eliza Hittman, Beach Rats is a moving coming-of-age story filmed in annoyingly grainy 16-millimeter about Frankie, a handsome 19-year-old who doesn\u2019t know what to do with his pointless existence. He\u2019s a high school graduate with no ambition, no imagination, and no focus, unemployed with no prospects, living at home with a hostile younger sister, a chain-smoking mother, and a father dying of cancer from whom Frankie steals an occasional opioid painkiller to share with his buddies. Like his gang of macho cronies, he passes the summer days lifting weights, smoking pot, riding the Coney Island bumper cars, soaking in the rays, and picking the occasional pocket. At night, he\u2019s glued to his computer, watching gay porn, scanning gay hookup sites and chat rooms and shyly posing naked. He eventually progresses to actual dates in the shadows of the sand dunes and alleys near the beach, usually with older men. He\u2019s not a criminal, because he only steals to be one of the gang, and he\u2019s not really gay (at first) because he confesses, when his tricks ask him what he\u2019s into: \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d He has no particular loyalty to his buddies, although they envy his natural ability as a babe magnet. He has a girlfriend named Simone (a terrific Madeline Weinstein) but shows no interest in sex, preferring the company of surrogate father figures who take him to bed and provide a fleeting affection he never got at home. Frankie, in fact, is a lost boy, shiftless and confused\u2014experimenting with sex out of desperate loneliness and very much the tragic victim of a stagnant, empty environment from which there is no escape. The script is non-linear, but eventually leads to one bold move in which Frankie tries to prove his manhood by inviting his pals to scam a lonely, clean-cut college student for his weed\u2014a dumb decision that ends in violence.\u000a\u000aBEACH RATS \u2605\u2605\u2605\u000a\u000a(3/4 stars)\u000a\u000aDirected by: Eliza Hittman\u000a\u000aWritten by: Eliza Hittman\u000a\u000aStarring: Harris Dickinson, Madeline Weinstein, Kate Hodge and Neal Huff\u000a\u000aRunning time: 95 mins.\u000a\u000aDirector Eliza Hittman explores Brooklyn\u2019s growing reputation as a mecca for confused young hipsters through focusing on one closeted young man, who knows he\u2019s different from the rest of the herd but clueless about how to do anything positive with the knowledge. The directorial style is the kind of evocative naturalism favored by John Cassavetes, yet entirely conventional, eventually inconclusive and emotionally shallow. Focusing on closeups of Frankie\u2019s abs, fingers, ripe lips and naked buttocks, it\u2019s eroticized without being graphic. The characters seem real in their inarticulate immaturity, but they all lack definition, including Frankie. He\u2019s the one you want to save, but he never really progresses beyond indifference to the prison of his own passivity. The subplots never amount to anything substantial, and the film has no ending. Frankie just dissolves into the Coney Island seascape in a blur to await the next sexual encounter.\u000a\u000aThe saving grace\u2014the thing that keeps you interested and caring\u2014is Dickinson, the newcomer with phenomenal potential, so honest and self-assured I can\u2019t wait to see what he does next. His perfect, laid-back New York drawl and loping beefcake stride belie his disciplined professional polish. When he trips over words, it\u2019s a touching attempt to hide his true feelings, or apologize for having any feelings at all. He\u2019s really worth seeing. The film he dominates, alas, fades from memory long before he does.

aVIf you\u2019ve ever been to the McKittrick Hotel, the site of Punchdrunk\u2019s immersive theater (and mandatory stop for visiting relatives) Sleep No More, you know it can get creepy at night. But even on an afternoon this summer\u2014empty of all Eyes Wide Shut masks, bellhops lip-syncing to Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d or impromptu nude dance sequence in blood baths\u2014the McKittrick still has a looming, menacing presence. Or maybe I was just nervous. After all, I was there to meet Sigourney Weaver, and a dark, semi-abandoned haunted house might have been the wrong call. Why couldn\u2019t I have picked a well-lit coffee shop to interview the star of all the Aliens and Ghostbusters?\u000a\u000aIf I was skittish, Weaver, already posing for photos when I tentatively tiptoed into an empty bar area, seemed entirely at ease. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget, they have my meat in the freezer,\u201d Weaver reminded no one in particular between poses. \u201cI really can\u2019t forget to take the meat with me when I go.\u201d Directly following our interview, Weaver would be driving back to the Adirondacks, and the possibility of leaving the meat (never clarified as to how much there was of it, or what kind) was causing her more anxiety than a Hitchcockian faux-tel. Weaver\u201468 years old and 6 feet tall without heels\u2014can make herself at home in even the most inhospitable of environments.\u000a\u000aThe notion that Sigourney Weaver is the embodiment of the \u201cDIY and take no shit\u201d authority figure for a generation of young women might sound, in retrospect, like a backhanded compliment. But for those of us who grew up as tomboys in the 80s, Weaver stood as shining beacon of some other way to be. While other girls wanted to be Princess Leia or Jasmine, there were always a few of us who wanted to be Ripley. Or later on, Katharine Parker in Working Girl, a woman so ahead of her time in office politicking that she managed to mash-up Claire Underwood from House of Cards and Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, a solid two decades before either existed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect time to be different,\u201d Weaver tells me on the topic of beauty standards, as we slide into a dark and quiet booth in the red-curtained bar room. \u201cI think it\u2019s our time.\u201d She notes her obsession with watching the Olympics. \u201cYou see the glorious range of what women look like, how strong they are. I think this is all changing on screen, as people want to see themselves reflected a little bit more. They don\u2019t want to see some little stick figure up there all the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat inspired me in the beginning was that Vanessa Redgrave was my height,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee, I guess if they want you, they must want your height.\u2019 Realistically, it protected me from being in more prosaic films, because I was never the little girlfriend. I didn\u2019t get to do a lot of love stories, which I think I would have enjoyed. Mostly I did other kinds of movies and other kinds of stories, partly because I was too tall for traditional roles. So it was really these crazy kind of directors who would look at me and say, \u2018You can do this!\u2019 Sometimes it would even be a man\u2019s role. That I didn\u2019t fit into the traditional mold, I think that\u2019s made my career much more interesting, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, that untraditional mold encompasses more than just Weaver\u2019s height and muscle tone. Born in Manhattan as Susan Alexandra Weaver (she renamed herself \u201cSigourney\u201d in 1965, basing it on a small character from The Great Gatsby) to an actress mother and a TV-producing father, Weaver spent her early years attending a series of private and prep schools before turning 18, when she promptly left for Israel and joined a Kibbutz for several months. When she came back to the states, she attended both Sarah Lawrence and Stanford University. She chalks up a lot of her success to the fact that she was an English major in her undergrad years. \u201cAt Stanford, they had a drama department, which I kind of assiduously avoided, because it did very square things. I joined this group called The Company, and we did outrageous new plays. We did commedia dell\u2019arte in a covered wagon and wandered around the Bay Area. A lot of Shakespeare.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough increasingly comfortable outside mainstream theater culture\u2014for a period of time at Stanford, Weaver dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house\u2014the actress did eventually audition for Yale\u2019s prestigious drama graduate program. She showed up to her appointment in a long sheet, tied off with a belt made out of rope, and proceeded to knit together three speeches from Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Saint Joan of the Stockyards. (One day, I would like to produce a line of dolls and accessories for children based on Sigourney Weaver. Not her in character, just Sigourney: She\u2019ll come with her own toga and tree house and well-worn copy of Threepenny Opera, but the car with a trunk carrying a month\u2019s worth of ice-packed sirloin is sold separately.)\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually had a difficult time [at Yale], because they took everything so seriously,\u201d Weaver recalls. \u201cThey gave you your own dressing room. It seemed so lonely to me. Everyone was so competitive. I thought, I really miss my friends, and having everyone do their makeup up in the same little piece of cracked mirror in the back of someone\u2019s truck.\u201d Weaver had to wait until she\u2019d graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1974 before she could recover her sense of community by performing in Off-Broadway shows.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, many of the films Weaver works on tend to have directors that cultivate a similar comrade-in-arms mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re illegitimate films,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201cBut for instance, I just worked with Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie), and we just did this crazy film in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was nothing you\u2019ve heard of. But it was really cool, like his version of a student film. It was really guerrilla filmmaking. It was two takes and move on. I just love working that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater, I will crosscheck her name with Blomkamp\u2019s to see what \u201chis version of a student film\u201d looks like. The movie turns out to be Alien 5.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s surprising to hear Sigourney Weaver talk about her legacy as a feminist movie icon. For beginners, she doesn\u2019t like to think of herself as a genre actress, even though she\u2019s associated with so many tough-as-nails sci-fi heroines.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think genres are very misleading,\u201d she says, almost reproachfully. \u201cRemember, I was an English major, so it was always about the story for me. I never cared what the role was, whether it was big or small.\u201d Same goes for movie franchises: Though she\u2019s a part of the culture, she holds herself at a distance from the Hollywood machine that churns out reboots, sequels and spinoffs with alarming frequency.\u000a\u000a\u2018All good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u2019\u2014 Sigourney Weaver\u000a\u000a\u201cSee, I\u2019m from the very old world, where setting out to make a franchise is a very bad idea,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think when you start off from the idea of a movie being part of a franchise, you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You have to start with one really good script and really good characters. Women have probably suffered, because people have tried to do the franchise thing. You have to find a role, that, whether played by a man or a woman, would be a really compelling character.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat said, Weaver is now attached to another Aliens film along with the upcoming Avatar sequels. \u201cLook, franchises have to be earned,\u201d she stresses. \u201cI know a lot of agents are telling young people nowadays to attach themselves to one. In the old days, that\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019d want, to be locked into a contract like that, for just one role. I\u2019m sure young people are just trying to be in movies. But sometimes even a little tiny movie can go around the world. And then, you see, you can have more of a say in it, should your little movie become a franchise. But first, you need to have a really great writer. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be put together by Hollywood people, adding a little this and that. I just don\u2019t think that works.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver is equally dismissive of the American film industry writ large. \u201cI never really feel like I went to Hollywood,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when I did actually go there, for a film like Ghostbusters, which was a big film by Universal, it was really our story that we were telling, and it felt like it belonged to us.\u201d On the opposite end of the spectrum from the work she\u2019s most well known for are some of her favorite roles, in underrated films like Scott Elliott\u2019s A Map of the World. Or 2006\u2019s Snow Cake, where she got to play opposite Alan Rickman. \u201cOften, when you sell a film to Harvey Weinstein and it\u2019s good,\u201d\u2014Weaver lets down her polished persona for a moment in a flash of teeth that could as easily be a puckish smile as a conspiratorial grimace\u2014\u201che just doesn\u2019t distribute it.\u201d\u000a\u000aEither way, Weaver figures, the old model of movies is on its way to extinction. \u201cThe Hollywood thing is going to be a dinosaur very soon.\u201d People are making and distributing movies on leaner budgets, and releasing them online, without the help of a major studio for distribution. \u201cIt\u2019s already happening, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver\u2019s latest role is in A Monster Calls, which is itself a pretty uncategorizable genre-blend. Ostensibly a kid\u2019s movie (though it\u2019s hard to imagine what child could walk out of the film without being traumatized) based on the \u201clow fantasy\u201d novel by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls takes the messaging of a John Green story and dresses it up in the psychedelic, phantasmagorical guise of a Heavenly Creatures or Pan\u2019s Labyrinth. Liam Neeson is the voice of a talking tree monster that is not Groot, though you could be forgiven for confusing the two. The titular tree monster is summoned to help a young boy Conor (Lewis MacDougall) deal with the impending death of his young mother. (A truly emaciated Felicity Jones, who we can at least agree is having a much better time in this holiday\u2019s other blockbuster escapist hit, Rogue One.) Weaver plays Conor\u2019s British grandmother, a woman who takes the concept of \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d a little too far. When Conor is forced to come live with her, we see that his grandmother has taken the same approach toward interior design: her living room filled with breakable knickknacks and irreplaceable family heirlooms. When Conor, in a fit of fantasy rage (portrayed in beautiful watercolor animation, to differentiate it from the \u201creal\u201d world) reduces the room to shards and splinters, he only has a moment to savor his destruction before hearing the key in the lock. Grandmother\u2019s home.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a testament to both the nuance of the character and Weaver\u2019s portrayal of her that the scene feels like it lasts a lifetime. Without saying a word, Weaver\u2019s eyes widen and waver as she daintily crunches through the wreckage until she comes to the one piece of furniture left untouched. Only then does she bare her teeth and let\u2019s us see the big bad wolf inside, howling in wordless rage and frustration as she deals out the fatal blow to the literal and metaphorical semblance of structure in her life. Then, still mute, she leaves the room, never once looking at Conor, who is screaming apologies and excuses all the while.\u000a\u000aLater, the boy will hear her sobbing in the bathroom, the door locked.\u000a\u000aDespite holding her own no less formidable opponents as ghosts, extraterrestrial slime monsters and even Jennifer Love Hewitt (Heartbreakers, anyone?), there\u2019s something so primal that Weaver tapped into when confronted by the young boy\u2019s outburst. In that moment, I didn\u2019t know if I was terrified of Weaver\u2019s grandmother or for her. The scariest possibility? Probably both.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly? I end up doing a lot of big movies, and I so wanted to do something very small and intimate and very dramatic,\u201d says Weaver on her decision to take the part, adding that she had been interested in working with director J.A. Bayona after seeing two of his films, The Orphanage and The Impossible. \u201cThe story really catches at your heart,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s not a film about cancer but about coming to terms with loss. I just knew Bayona would create something very original and so personal.\u201d\u000a\u000aSigourney Weaver is in a rush to get back upstate, so I remind her to take her frozen meat before asking her my one super-fan question: Did she ever find movies that she starred in too scary?\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, often!\u201d She laughs. \u201cWatching the Alien movies\u2026when you\u2019re on set, acting, you don\u2019t realize the sounds they are going to be adding later. It really does a number on you, when you\u2019re watching it as an audience member.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my scariest role?\u201d Weaver pauses. \u201cMy character in Copycat was completely nuts.\u201d This was her turn as an agoraphobic psychologist in Jon Amiel\u2019s 1995 psychological thriller. (Surprisingly, as I found out, not based on a Thomas Harris novel!) Sigourney Weaver, a.k.a. Ripley, a.k.a. one of the toughest women in the biz, stands up and shudders. \u201cThat woman? She just scared the hell out of me.\u201d

aV\u201cTanning is about products that are easy at home, no hassle\u2014not scary tanning, but someone using it and feeling confident with what they\u2019re doing,\u201d James Read told us, spray gun in hand. The Observer spoke to the London-based tanning expert, who became famous for his tantouring technique, where he emphasizes collar bones and décolletage, creating a natural glow that won\u2019t turn orange under camera lights.\u000a\u000aRead has been working in tanning for 15 years. Since his start, he\u2019s become the go-to guy to the stars, including Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Jessie J, Naomi Campbell and Mariah Carey.\u000a\u000aRead is one reason the Lindsay Lohan\u2019s orange look fell out of favor in the early aughts. \u201cI helped change people\u2019s perception of tanning,\u201d he told us from his room at the Gramercy Hotel, which had more than enough room for a tanning tent. \u201cA lot of celebrities I tanned from the beginning, like Gaga and Rosie Huntington-Whitely, started to strip back from orange looking tans at award ceremonies to natural looking glows. It was all about working with your whole look, not overpowering it.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, some tan fans still go for the darkest hue. \u201cThe younger market is jumping back on the dark tans again,\u201d Read revealed. \u201cWhereas people in their 30s are more into the natural glow. Eighteen to 25 are into full on dark tans in UK and Australia.\u201d He\u2019s even launching a super dark tanning product in Australia to embrace the aesthetic.\u000a\u000aHe launched his brand seven years ago, as a way to combine tanning and skincare. His products include everything from an overnight mask to a tantour kit. \u201cI was giving all the products to Rosie [Huntington-Whitely] and Ellie Goulding, and they were testing it. Rosie was obsessed with the sleep mask and giving it to her friends. Cara Delevingne bought it on a British Airways flight, which was quite cool.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor those who would rather tan at home than strip down to their skivvies in front of a stranger, it\u2019s easy to get the same glow. Read\u2019s tips are to moisturize, never apply too much, wait three to four days to re-apply and to moisturize daily. \u201cAs the old tan breaks, it takes the new tan with it, and that\u2019s how the tans look patchy. Then you look orange, you get the dodgy angles, or the hands and the wrists,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFor special events, Read suggests photographing yourself to make sure it\u2019s not too dark. \u201cDo a tan selfie and you\u2019ll be able to see what the tan looks like. You see differently through a camera lens, it shows how people will actually be seeing you.\u201d And if you want the same tan as your favorite celebrity, Read suggests his tantouring technique. \u201cTantouring is about using the tan to contour certain areas of the body, so you look fit. Tan the day before, wash the tan off, then stand in front of the mirror and spray the tops of the legs, the front of the shoulders, the décolletage, down the sides. Leave it on for an hour then wash it off and it will highlight the areas.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut women aren\u2019t the only ones aiming for a golden glow. \u201cMen now have jumped on the whole tanning thing,\u201d Read told us. \u201cRyan Reynolds uses the bronzing mist and the sleep mask because he\u2019s filming Deadpool 2 and requested all the stuff to be sent so he can tan himself while filming.\u201d The popularity has led to Read creating a new product specifically for men to use after they shave.\u000a\u000aIf you can\u2019t make it to visit Read personally, at his central London spray tanning suite, there\u2019s still the opportunity to tantour in the comfort of your own home. His products have been sold since 2014 on Net-a-Porter, and they\u2019re now at Sephora.

aVNEWARK \u2013 World leaders gathered on Tuesday in Johannesburg, South Africa to honor Nelson Mandela, a man who dedicated his life to fighting, and defeating, apartheid, a system of racial segregation embedded in his country\u2019s laws and enforced by its police. When remembering Mandela, New Jersey\u2019s leaders have mentioned a disturbing truth \u2013 the Garden State, in many ways, suffers de facto segregation that leaves its citizens separate but unequal.\u000a\u000aIt was Gov. Jim Florio who first coined the term \u201cthe two New Jerseys\u201d in his 1990 inaugural address, the same year Mandela was freed from prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor New Jersey to be truly a commonwealth, we simply cannot have two New Jerseys,\u201d Florio said. \u201cOne where youngsters go off on a road to college, and another where youngsters go off on a road to despair. One where towns flourish with the rewards of prosperity, and another with decaying cities, littered with abandoned cars and abandoned hopes.\u201d\u000a\u000aNearly 25 years later, the hope of closing this gap is a dream deferred.\u000a\u000aOne example of the continuing divide between rich and poor New Jersey was underscored by recent studies released jointly by Rutgers-Newark and UCLA in October. Stark numbers presented in the reports indicate that in the 2010-11 school year, almost half of black and Hispanic students attended schools where fewer than 10 percent of the students were white, and many attended schools where there were essentially no white students. The Rutgers report from the university\u2019s Institute on Education Law and Policy went so far as to call 191 of 1,597 schools statewide \u201capartheid schools,\u201d defined as schools where 1 percent or less of the student population is white and where at least 79 percent of students are low-income, a \u201cdouble segregation\u201d marked by race and poverty.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Dr. M. William Howard, Jr., pastor of Newark\u2019s Bethany Baptist Church and the former chairman of Rutgers\u2019 Board of Governors, met Mandela personally as a result of his decades-long anti-apartheid activism.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew Jersey is arguably one of the most racially segregated states in the nation,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe question for me is not only race, but economics. Black people came to places like Newark, Paterson and Camden from the South to find work. That work has now disappeared, but those residents remained. The absence of capital, combined with a smidgen of racism, has produced the separation of families, decline in housing, increase in crime, and decline in the public schools in the cities. You will find black people living in some of the wealthiest suburbs in the state, provided they can afford the housing, and therefore have access to the suburban public schools.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we face today in our urban centers in our state is what Mandela still faced at the time of his death in South Africa,\u201d Howard added. \u201cIf we were to go together now to South Africa, we would find millions of black people living in the same squalid conditions that they knew before Mandela was released from prison. And we would find certain highly educated, economically advantaged black people now living in opulent, suburban areas. I\u2019m sure than Mandela recognized this, was not happy with this, and saw it as the long-term work of the South African government and society to correct this imbalance. New Jersey\u2019s cities are largely populated by people who are unlikely to be able to access the modern economy. You cannot explain the horrific situation of segregation in the state of New Jersey only in terms of race. To continue to chip away at public schools by the introduction of charter schools to the point that they are almost tipping the balance in places like Newark is a big mistake. Education is not only the key to reviving our central cities \u2013 it\u2019s the key to keeping our competitive edge in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoland Anglin, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers, noted that the man seen as the father of South Africa would take a similar guiding hand to the Garden State\u2019s problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would first say that we need to look at the things that created segregation in New Jersey, just the way he looked at the things that created segregation in South Africa,\u201d Anglin said. \u201cI think he would say that the thing South Africa did with their struggle, that we perhaps need to do, is to have a clear and decisive forum for reconciliation and move forward on the things that are still problematic. In Newark, for example, we\u2019ve never come to a real reconciliation about the disturbances of the 1960s, and how society needed to do more to make sure that those who have been left behind have an adequate opportunity to progress so that balanced communities can be formed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have the suburbanization of people of color in New Jersey, but they are being re-concentrated in pockets,\u201d Anglin added. \u201cResidential patterns are not happening in a way that promotes upward mobility. Change involves some level of enforcing fair-housing laws that challenges landlords who won\u2019t rent to certain racial minorities coming out of urban areas. It also involves some level of incentives and social engineering. We don\u2019t have that appetite as a society, much less as a state. Nelson Mandela would say that we need to cement the public will on all sides to make change, not just people in urban areas \u2013 that\u2019s a doomed strategy. It is no one\u2019s interest to have a poor, under-fed class of people who don\u2019t have access to opportunity. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that they participate in the public life and economic life of this state and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor her part, Assemblywoman Grace Spencer (D-29) recalled protesting against apartheid during her college years. Many commentators have observed that there were two distinct periods in Nelson Mandela\u2019s career: a confrontational period where he advocated armed struggle against apartheid, the other a more conciliatory period after his release from prison that smoothed the way to majority rule in South Africa. Regarding what kind of public leadership is needed to end de facto segregation in New Jersey, Spencer suggested the adoption of a hybrid tone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe person who is rambunctious and defiant begins to call attention to de facto segregation in New Jersey,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut you also need the person who is more conciliatory who can bring people together and mend the wounds of the problem. I don\u2019t think apartheid would have ended if it wasn\u2019t for the rambunctious Mandela, and I don\u2019t think there would have been such a good transition without the conciliatory Mandela. You need both.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the man who encapsulated the concept of two New Jerseys, what must be done to end de facto desegregation in the state is clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would feel a need to speak out and point out the deficiencies that exist. We still do have two New Jerseys. Things have changed a bit, but only for the worse,\u201d Gov. Florio told PolitickerNJ.com. \u201cThe middle class is now feeling threatened by economic problems as well. It\u2019s going to take policy changes to make us a much more egalitarian society. Mr. Mandela would be out in the forefront trying to get those changes made.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need leadership that is willing to tell people things that they don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Florio added. \u201cAt this point, there are no good options. It\u2019s the difference between losing a finger and being decapitated. During the gubernatorial campaign we just went through, neither of the candidates, nor the press, talked about the overwhelming fiscal problems we\u2019re going to have in New Jersey in the coming years. That\u2019s because if you talk about it, someone is going to ask you what you\u2019re going to do about it. We all know poverty exists. But somebody\u2019s got to start talking about it. Somebody\u2019s got to be out front. Nelson Mandela is a good example of someone who was willing to take on things that were much more burdensome than things that we experienced. If he was willing to do that, then we have to have people who will at least raise issues for debate.\u201d

aVAn ongoing controversy in opera production today is the question of \u201ccreator\u2019s intentions,\u201d that is, how a composer might have expected his work to look and sound upon the stage.\u000a\u000aWhat voice type, for instance, did Bizet have in mind for the title role of Carmen, a soprano or a mezzo? How much improvisation upon the written notes would Bellini have expected in his Norma? And would Wagner have recognized his Parsifal set under a highway overpass in post-apocalyptic America?\u000a\u000aThe fact that these debates are based largely on guesswork doesn\u2019t daunt the antagonists. In fact, there\u2019s even a Facebook group opposing so-called \u201cmodern\u201d opera productions, and naturally, another group in favor. One topic, though, is not so often addressed: the actual size of the theater in which the opera is performed.\u000a\u000aThe Metropolitan Opera, for instance, with its approximately 3,800 seats, is a far larger space than the venues the biggest operatic composers would have envisioned. And yet the Met performs works like Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni, an intimate piece, which premiered in 1787 at Prague\u2019s Estates Theater with a capacity of about 650\u2014roughly that of New York\u2019s smallest Broadway houses.\u000a\u000aSo the chance to see Don Giovanni in a theater closer to the size of the estates not only lends an air of authenticity, but, as last week\u2019s Mostly Mozart\u2019s presentation of the opera revealed, it can be revelatory. Conducted and directed by Iván Fischer, this production in the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center (capacity of 1,100) achieved an easy, big-house feel Mozart operas almost never attain.\u000a\u000aThe visual element of this production was simplicity itself: a void of black drapes surrounded a couple of stage platforms. Inside this neutral space, a corps of singers and dancers made up in marble-white suggested both architecture and background extras. In one particularly charming moment, a tangle of sozzled peasant girls gracefully stood and arrange themselves into a gazebo behind which the nervous bride Zerlina could hide.\u000a\u000aNaturally, focus fell on the solo singers, who, for the most part gave sensitive, detailed performances. Finest of all was Christopher Maltman, his crisp lyric baritone sounding both commanding and mercurial, a perfect match for his sleek stage demeanor. As the violated Donna Anna, soprano Laura Aikin may have lacked the ultimate in steely power, but commanded pinpoint virtuosity for the fiendishly difficult aria \u201cNon mi dir\u201d in the second act.\u000a\u000aIf the remaining singers were not exactly starry, they formed a tight, energetic ensemble. And while the Budapest Festival Orchestra\u2019s playing was not literally \u201cwhat Mozart would have wanted\u201d\u2014the 18th century composer would surely have raised an eyebrow at the strings\u2019 modern vibrato\u2014I think he would have laughed with delight at the group\u2019s impeccable attack and sweet tone.

aVAs Conde Nast looks set to announce consolidation of its publishing division following similar changes at Hearst Magazines last year, other, smaller players in the sector have better news. New York-based niche magazine, Paper, just celebrated its 32nd successful year in print. Meanwhile, in Munich, Germany, Platea, an independent art and fashion magazine, rejoiced its snowballing readership. The quarterly magazine targeted at young creatives has been in business for less than two years and already garnered a loyal audience within Europe. Likewise, The Gentlewoman, a magazine based in London aimed at intellectual women with \u201cstyle and purpose,\u201d has been growing exponentially throughout a seven year run.\u000a\u000aVestoj, Dazed and Confused, Love, Kinfolk, V, Interview, and System are independent magazines, some names less familiar than others, enjoying growing success while their mainstream counterparts such as Instyle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan have shown a consistent drop in circulation. At a time when print is seemingly waning with many titles now transitioning to digital-only, the success of mainly fashion-based indie magazines seems puzzling. Yet, a quick look through any of them reveals one simple ingredient: contemporary voices and a deeper connection with the audience. The content and design appeals to those attracted by new, avant-garde inspiration and is unfettered by fashion advertising behemoths. This is not to say though, that fashion brands are not on board. Many are lining up for space in the most influential spots and the kudos of appearing alongside raw, emerging talent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNiche and indie magazines are very in touch with their audience, they tend to be lean mean fighting machines, often run by a single person who can nimbly engage with their audience far more easily than a mainstream magazine that\u2019s often weighed down by too many people involved in the decision making & production process,\u201d James Hyman told observer.com. Hyman is founder of The Hyman Archive in London, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest collection of magazines.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost independent titles consist of small teams, often dispersed across different parts of the world. Instead of self-aggrandizing and building personal brands, niche editors are motivated by a sense of purpose and enthusiasm for their publication\u2019s cultural role. The key word here is \u2018niche,\u2019 something most commercial fashion magazines have lost sight of, with far too many similarities between them. \u201c[Independent] magazines have smaller teams and lower overheads, and are published less often. Smaller teams mean more focused, controlled decision-making. The mainstream, on the other hand, has commoditized itself and become repetitive, and more concerned with business rather than being creatively focused,\u201d explained Jeremy Leslie, creative director at MagCulture, one of the most respected magazine stores in London stocking over 350 different titles.\u000a\u000aHe added that most mainstream magazines are now at a point where they don\u2019t have a voice of their own and have become clones in terms of both character and physical nature, \u201c [They\u2019re] all the same size, same paper, same number of pages. Straight in the recycle bin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertising pressures are one of the top reasons for the decline in the quality of content in traditional print titles. A source close to I-D, a British art, fashion and youth culture magazine confirmed how it lost a chunk of its readership as their content became more commercially driven, after being bought by Vice in 2012, a multimedia company partly owned by Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new I-D magazine is just another place to view cool work\u2014no thoughtful criticism or fascinating narrative that once made it worth reading,\u201d noted an agitated user on a reddit thread.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you need to please advertisers, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to take risks and when you\u2019re aiming for demographics, you\u2019re not going to go out on a limb and do something really different,\u201d said Steven Watson, founder at Stack Magazines, a subscription service that selects and delivers new, independent titles to users every month.\u000a\u000aAlthough independent publications don\u2019t have mighty commercial obligations at their heels, they do need support. Penny Martin of The Gentlewoman, noted that although they are growing, with \u201ca very healthy advertising quotient of around 30 percent,\u201d they don\u2019t let that interfere with the content, \u201cWe are working with companies who respect our independent ideals and understand that a magazine publishing long form articles and lavishing space on typography and design has fewer pages to display product.\u201d\u000a\u000aTypically created with an immense attention to detail plus great design and photography and in some cases better paper quality\u2014some small titles become minor works of art. \u201cI wanted to do print to have a platform to cherish the content I collect. It has a stronger appearance and is more special. It doesn\u2019t get thrown away. Crafting magazines is an art form and a lot of people are involved and brought together to create something that you can touch and feel. It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Tristan Boettcher, editor in chief at Platea.\u000a\u000aWatson added that the superior quality of these young titles has made them a luxury product and more collectible than the old guard. \u201cIt\u2019s in part a response to the mainstream which over the last 10 years has reduced the thickness of the paper to make it cheaper and reduced the budgets because of falling revenues. So now a group of independent magazine makers have decided, \u2018Magazines don\u2019t have to be like this, we can print magazines in beautiful thick paper, with beautiful typography and design and we could charge £10 for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy becoming an indispensable item, the indie magazine circuit is also winning the print versus digital debate, where online media just can\u2019t offer the quality or longevity that these publications do.\u000a\u000aWatson argued that niche publications don\u2019t see digital as competition or a threat but as a tool to further their own popularity. \u201cI think it\u2019s really about what makes your product different from everything else. Build everything around that thing. Then not only does it become something that you can\u2019t get online, you can\u2019t get that anywhere else. That is really the magic of these publications.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis doesn\u2019t mean the bells are tolling for all traditional magazines. U.S Vogue, for instance, consistently re-invents content, featuring youthfully influential and diverse personalities and blasting a hole in tradition with the controversial but ultimately successful, Kimye cover. Modern publishing requires a rethinking of purpose. Leslie advised that it is all about striking a balance between familiarity and repetition, and celebrating the possibilities of the manufacturing process without losing its uniqueness, \u201cCreatively, print is bang in the center of a hugely innovative golden age. Just be sure of your magazine\u2019s point of view and personality and don\u2019t be a cheap copy.\u201d

aVIn explosive testimony that cast a new cloud on Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration, Todd Barretta, the recently ousted NJ Transit chief compliance officer, claimed Friday that he was fired after being told repeatedly to ignore the systematic safety and staffing issues he uncovered at the embattled rail operator.\u000a\u000aBarretta, who was fired last week after six months on the job, gave extensive testimony to a joint legislative oversight committee of the Assembly and Senate, laying out in stark terms how he was rebuffed as he sought to ensure NJ Transit followed appropriate safety and staffing procedures.\u000a\u000aThe rail agency is a \u201crunaway train\u201d plagued by a \u201cculture of secrecy\u201d and fear-mongering, he said. Baretta said he would not want to ride the rail system because of its antiquated infrastructure.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a toxic environment that promotes a culture not accepting of any corrective course,\u201d he testified. \u201cAlthough my tenure was extremely short in terms of time, I witnessed more occurrences of agency-wide mismanagement fueled by ignorance, arrogance, hypocrisy, incompetence, patronage, cover-up and corruption than one can reasonably expect to experience throughout an entire career.\u201d\u000a\u000aBarretta said agency leadership repeatedly told him to stand down as he outlined issues involving outdated policies, employee safety testing and potential misuse of Superstorm Sandy recovery money. He claimed officials told him to stop putting his analyses in writing.\u000a\u000aBarretta said he observed instructors giving engineers the answers to continuing education tests. He said he was admonished when he chronicled this in a memo.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tests were done together as groups so the answers were given and then everyone filled in the bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cOutrageous is an understatement.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn one instance, Barretta said, NJ Transit Executive Director Steven Santoro made him remove sections of a memo he wrote about the agency\u2019s compliance with New Jersey\u2019s family leave law for employees.\u000a\u000aBarretta said he was demoted in July and was told NJ Transit would \u201cbring in someone with more experience in public agency culture.\u201d He was later suspended and then terminated on Aug. 21, he told the committee. Asked after his testimony if he thought he was fired because he was pointing out systematic issues at the agency, Barretta said, \u201cI believe so.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said a \u201cclub of individuals\u201d at the agency \u201cterrorize other employees,\u201d saying he faced retaliation and was not told details about an internal investigation into his suspension.\u000a\u000aThat NJ Transit has been deeply underfunded for years under Christie and before is no secret. The agency has diverted millions of dollars from capital funding projects to be able to keep covering the cost of its operations, and fares have increased several times in recent years. Christie has had difficulty recruiting a leader for NJ Transit with the right \u201cexperience in public agency culture.\u201d William Crosbie, a former chief operating officer of Amtrak, accepted the top job only to pull out last year before his start date.\u000a\u000aBut Barretta\u2019s testimony gave a close and disturbing look at the lengths NJ Transit\u2019s top executives will go to sweep problems under the rug, and raised questions about whether those executives are adequately considering passenger safety and complying with the law.\u000a\u000aSantoro looked on as Barretta gave his roughly 45-minute testimony. Afterward, he told the committee that Barretta was originally suspended for \u201csignificant misuse\u201d of his NJ Transit vehicle, and questioned Barretta\u2019s ability to assess the agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Barretta has only been here for a few months,\u201d Santoro said. \u201cHow he can make that observation is interesting.\u201d\u000a\u000aLying under oath to a legislative committee is an offense under state law. But neither Barretta nor Santoro was sworn in before giving public testimony on Friday.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom discrimination, to negligence to possible outright malfeasance, the allegations we heard today are disturbing, to say the least,\u201d Assemblywoman Liz Muoio (D-Mercer) said after the hearing in a statement. \u201cA system that was once considered a jewel amongst state transit operations has been described today as a \u2018toxic environment,\u2019 wasting millions of taxpayer dollars and endangering public safety. If the former compliance officer for NJ Transit doesn\u2019t feel comfortable putting his family on our trains, why should the general public?\u201d

aVIn June 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz for violating the DNC Charter by rigging the Democratic presidential primaries for Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders. Even former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid admitted in July 2016, \u201c\u201cI knew\u2014everybody knew\u2014that this was not a fair deal.\u201d He added adding that Debbie Wasserman Schultz should have resigned much sooner than she did. The lawsuit was filed to push the DNC to admit their wrongdoing and provide Bernie Sanders supporters, who supported him financially with millions of dollars in campaign contributions, with restitution for being cheated.\u000a\u000aOn August 25, 2017, Federal Judge William Zloch, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation in which DNC attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidate. \u201cIn evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are true\u2014that the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent,\u201d the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated.\u000a\u000aThe order then explained why the lawsuit would be dismissed. \u201cThe Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chair\u2019s conduct\u2014the keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not.\u201d The court added that it did not consider this within its jurisdiction. \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, possessing \u2018only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.'\u201d\u000a\u000aThe order reaffirmed that the primaries were tipped in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor, but the court\u2019s authority to intervene in a court of law is limited.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Court thus assumes that the DNC and Wasserman Schultz preferred Hillary Clinton as the Democratic candidate for president over Bernie Sanders or any other Democratic candidate. It assumes that they stockpiled information useful to the Clinton campaign. It assumes that they devoted their resources to assist Clinton in securing the party\u2019s nomination and opposing other Democratic candidates. And it assumes that they engaged in these surreptitious acts while publically proclaiming they were completely neutral, fair, and impartial. This Order therefore concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt this time, it\u2019s unclear if the attorneys who filed the class action lawsuit, Jared and Elizabeth Beck, will pursue other legal recourse regarding the 2016 Democratic primaries.

aVOn August 24, the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Energy censored a Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science proposal from Dr. Jennifer Bowen, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.\u000a\u000aShe posted a screenshot of the email on Facebook, writing, \u201cThis just happened. I\u2019m just going to leave this here for people to ponder.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the email, Dr. Bowen was told, \u201cI have been asked to contact you to update the wording in your proposal abstract to remove words such as \u2018global warming\u2019 or \u2018climate change.\u2019 This is being asked as we have to meet the president\u2019s budget language restrictions and don\u2019t want to make any changes without your knowledge or consent. Below is the current wording for your abstract\u2014at your next convenience, will you kindly revise the wording and send back to me as soon as you can? That way we can update our website.\u201d The words \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal warming\u201d were highlighted for removal in the proposal.\u000a\u000aDr. Bowen wrote that the email is \u201ctotally real and terrifying.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the Department of Energy\u2019s website, a press release was issued on August 23 announcing the acceptance of 14 Joint Genome Institute proposals, including the one Dr. Bowen submitted. The press release notes the following:\u000a\u000a\u201cJennifer Bowen of Northeastern University and co-PI Jonathan Sanderman of Woods Hole Research Center will combine high resolution organic matter characterization and microbial meta-omics to assess the effects of nutrient loading on salt marsh carbon sequestration. They will analyze sediment samples from three-meter-deep cores, where the deepest sediments are approximately 3000 years old, that have been collected as part of a multi-investigator project studying the long-term nutrient enrichment of salt marshes at the NSF initiated Plum Island Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research site. Their goal is to obtain new insights into the forces that control carbon storage in salt marsh sediments and how exposure of those sediments to a critical global change driver, nitrate enrichment, alters carbon storage capacity, a critical ecosystem service.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn March 2017, Politico reported that \u201ca supervisor at the Energy Department\u2019s international climate office told staff this week not to use the phrases \u2018climate change,\u2019 \u2019emissions reduction\u2019 or \u2018Paris Agreement\u2019 in written memos, briefings or other written communication, sources have told Politico.\u201d It appears that censorship has permeated into other aspects of the Department of Energy, including censoring scientists who contribute research and data to the government agency. The action came shortly after Trump signed an executive order repealing several of Barack Obama\u2019s climate regulatory initiatives.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian reported earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has been censored from using the term \u201cclimate change.\u201d They have been directed to use the phrase \u201cweather extremes\u201d instead.\u000a\u000aScientists have feared the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to scale back and undermine climate change initiatives. On August 7, The New York Times reported that scientists from 13 federal agencies leaked a climate change report for fear it would be censored or its findings would be prevented from release. The Trump administration is politicizing and manipulating scientists\u2019 work and research to better fit its own political agenda, which favors industries that profit from suppressing climate change science.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Energy\u2019s Joint Genome Institute has not yet responded to a request for comment.

aVCobie Smulders wants to know where she can rent an RV.\u000a\u000aThe actress, best known for her work on How I Met Your Mother, is currently making her Broadway debut in a revival of Noel Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. But on a recent Monday morning the statuesque brunette was looking ahead to July, when her run ends and she, her husband (Saturday Night Live alum Taran Killam, who\u2019s currently starring in Hamilton) and their two children (ages 2 and 7) head back to California.\u000a\u000aSmulders wants to make the cross-country journey in a trailer, but she\u2019s at a loss for where to begin\u2014until one of her stylists recommends a dealership in Weehawken, New Jersey, at which point Smulders says she\u2019ll \u201cget on that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old is no stranger to long road trips. Early in her acting career, she made an annual pilgrimage from her home in Vancouver to Los Angeles to try her luck during TV pilot season (which runs from November to March). She and her Canuck cohorts referred to the trip as the \u201cCanadian migration.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d work in restaurants all year long to make money, and then blow it for three months in L.A. while we were trying to get jobs,\u201d Smulders told the Observer during an interview at the Musket Room, a barn stable turned high-end restaurant in lower Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSmulders participated in theater clubs throughout elementary and high school, and she also briefly moved to New York to pursue her craft\u2014that\u2019s where she saw Rent and first dreamed of being on Broadway.\u000a\u000aBut it was those trips to L.A. that bore the most fruit. Indeed, during Smulders\u2019 third pilot season she landed her breakout role as TV reporter Robin Scherbatsky on How I Met Your Mother. The CBS sitcom debuted in 2005 and ran for nine seasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was one of those magical things that just kept going,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aAmong the most magical parts of it (at least for Smulders) was that her character had a pop star alter ego named Robin Sparkles, whose hits included \u201cLet\u2019s Go to the Mall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of the major complaints for long-running shows is that they become mundane,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cI never felt that way because of stuff like Robin Sparkles.\u201d\u000a\u000aOutside this fantasy world, Robin was the on-again, off-again love interest of both Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Indeed, in the series finale, after the titular mother dies, Ted\u2019s kids convince him to give his relationship with Robin another shot (she and Barney have married and divorced by this point).\u000a\u000aMany fans were disappointed in the way the series wrapped up, and while Smulders disagrees she\u2019s glad that people had strong opinions about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople were really emotionally invested in this show,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful way to end the time we spent together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmulders\u2019 fan base expanded from comedy fans to comic book fanboys when she was cast as badass S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (and Samuel L. Jackson sidekick) Maria Hill in the Avengers franchise. She met Joss Whedon (director of the first two films) through her Mother co-star Alyson Hannigan.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe humans aren\u2019t as interesting to watch in a battle, but Joss is kind and makes sure every actor has a moment,\u201d said Smulders, who will appear in next summer\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War.\u000a\u000aShe also made waves earlier this year after a mysterious cameo on the Netflix show Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2014the series cut away from the main action several times to show Smulders and Will Arnett handcuffed in the back of a van and exploring Peru, among other adventures. The couple\u2019s entire storyline turned out to be a red herring.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy character didn\u2019t die, so I have no idea what they\u2019re gonna do next season,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs such, Smulders is refocusing on comedy while she stars in Present Laughter, which opens April 5 at the St. James Theatre. And it\u2019s clear her comedic instincts are still strong from her sitcom days\u2014at one point during the photo shoot for this article, she started nibbling on a chili pepper that was sitting on the bar, a sight to make even the most hardened cynic chuckle.\u000a\u000aWhile this is Smulders\u2019 first time on Broadway, she\u2019s been a fan of Coward since the beginning of her career\u2014she performed scenes from his classic Private Lives in acting classes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love the way he uses comedy as a weapon,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aThe main sharpshooter in Present Laughter is Garry Essendine (played by Oscar and Tony winner Kevin Kline), a celebrated, self-absorbed actor with a voracious libido who\u2019s going through a midlife crisis. Throughout the play he negotiates comic conflicts with his wife, producer, director, secretary and servants, among others.\u000a\u000aSmulders plays Joanna Lyppiatt, who\u2019s married to Garry\u2019s producer but is also infatuated with Garry himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all feel like we can help him in some way or save him in some way or make his life better in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all want to be with him, and we think we know him, so it\u2019s a bit of a game trying to get into the inner circle of this world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaying the game with a formidable opponent like Kline keeps Smulders on her toes\u2014she described him as an \u201cidiot savant\u201d who takes comedy seriously.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe keeps changing and keeping things interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s like water: so fluid, going from one thing to the next. He\u2019s a true artist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same traits apply to Smulders herself, according to Present Laughter director Moritz von Stuelpnagel (a Tony nominee for helming Hand to God).\u000a\u000a\u201cCobie was built for the theater,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cShe\u2019s thoughtful about storytelling and precise in her comedy. It\u2019s been a real joy to watch her take a character that might otherwise descend into a flat archetype and have her flesh the role out with dynamic humanity.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Coward\u2019s fast-paced writing style is similar to the patter on sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother, Smulders said sustaining that rhythm for almost three hours presented a new challenge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing in a 15 minute scene is unlike anything you have to do on film or TV,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Broadway grind of rehearsals and performances has also had an impact on Smulders\u2019 home life, especially since her spouse is in the same boat\u2014Killam is playing King George III in Hamilton through April 13.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously there\u2019s a little bit of a \u2018Who\u2019s getting up first to take care of the kids\u2019 type of situation,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cBut aside from the lack of sleep, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019re together in ways that we haven\u2019t been before.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe and Killam meet for dinner together on two show days. Smulders admitted she takes advantage of the fact that her future RV partner is in Broadway\u2019s biggest hit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s a part of it, and by association I feel like I\u2019m a part of it, but maybe that\u2019s just me being greedy,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGreed aside, Smulders said that her time in New York had been \u201ca dream\u201d thus far.\u000a\u000a\u201cI keep fooling people into giving me jobs, and now I\u2019m on Broadway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always something I\u2019ve wanted to be a part of, and I can\u2019t believe that this is the experience I\u2019m having.\u201d

aVTomorrow night\u2019s fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor in Las Vegas is poised to break pay-per-view records. And while no one knows who will win this bout for the ages, it\u2019s clear that one of the competitors has a back-up plan in place.\u000a\u000aYou see, Mayweather isn\u2019t just a world famous boxer. He\u2019s also a bitcoin aficionaodo.\u000a\u000aIn the past few weeks, Mayweather\u2019s social media feeds have alternated between posts hyping the fight and valentines to cryptocurrency. He even told his Twitter and Instagram followers to call him \u201cFloyd Crypto Mayweather.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt all started in the last week of July, when Mayweather posted about Stox, an open source platform where users can predict the outcome of finance, politics and sporting events (presumably its algorithm favors Mayweather in this weekend\u2019s fight).\u000a\u000aStox is powered by the STX digital token, which opened its initial coin offering (ICO, the bitcoin version of an initial public offering) on August 2.\u000a\u000aICOs aren\u2019t federally regulated yet, but that didn\u2019t stop Mayweather from bragging to his followers about his newest investment. A week before the ICO he posted two \u201cChampion Predictions\u201d on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m gonna make a shit ton of money on August 26. I\u2019m gonna make a shit ton of money on August 2 on the Stox.com ICO.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was right\u2014the ICO raised $33 million on its first day.\u000a\u000aSo now Mayweather\u2019s at it again. In the midst of fight prep on Wednesday, he promoted Hubii, a blockchain-based media tech company that opened its ICO yesterday. Mayweather expressed his hope, via an Instagram post, that Hubii\u2019s digital currency could be used for \u201csmart contracts for sports.\u201d\u000a\u000aHubii aims to raise $50 million during this ICO, though it\u2019s not open to American investors. So since Mayweather\u2019s Instagram plug for Hubii used the hashtag #ad, some outlets are speculating that the company paid him for the promotion.\u000a\u000aMayweather certainly isn\u2019t lacking for cash\u2014he stands to make $25 million in merchandising alone from the McGregor fight. But win or lose, it looks like he\u2019ll have a lucrative second career as a bitcoin pitchman.

aVIn this era of yoga pants, it\u2019s easy to forget the leotard\u2014early active-wear that required the confidence of a naked emperor.\u000a\u000aNamed after Jules Léotard, a 19th-century French acrobat (and a man), the garment is known for its close fit and resemblance to a woman\u2019s bathing suit. Unlike the unitard, leotards have no legs and tend to ride up one\u2019s rear in an asymmetric fashion that defies science.\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, I am leo-phobic, avoiding all situations that could put me near crotch-slinging clothing. I hate \u201csexy Halloween\u201d costumes and business tops that stay tucked in because they snap over one\u2019s skivvies. When I see celebrities in spangly bodysuits, I slam my hand on the table. Uh-uh, Taylor Swift.\u000a\u000aUnlike my younger millennial counterparts, I have a history with the leotard that they should understand.\u000a\u000aAs a child of the 1980s, I envied my mother\u2019s puffed sleeve bodysuit, the one she wore while executing the Jane Fonda Workout. When I was a little girl in tap class, I got my own first leotard, a light blue long-sleeve garment with a zipper down the front. I still remember how the nylon felt on my skin: scratchy with a chemically enhanced stretchiness. There was always an air pocket in the lower back, but I liked that I looked like a superhero when I opened my arms in a \u201cT\u201d and posed with one foot off the floor. As I bloomed from four-years-old to five, I swear my leotard tried to stunt my growth by giving me a constant frontal wedgie.\u000a\u000aLater, I minored in dance in college. As I trekked through the snow from history to ballet, I felt like black bodysuits and pink tights were a humid second skin under my jeans and sweaters. Meanwhile, the fitness world hamstring curled itself around the dance crowd. Early adapters graduated from striped leotards to sports bras and baggy Adidas pants, à la Sporty Spice.\u000a\u000aAfter college, I became a professional dancer and saved my money for audition leotards. My favorite was a bright red number with lots of criss-crossing stripes in the back. These leos weren\u2019t cheap, ranging between $50 to $75, but they helped individuals stand out during cattle calls with hundreds of other young women. In the early 2000s, custom-made unitards became the \u201cit\u201d item. A few years later, leggings and tank tops emerged as the vestments of the Pilates and yoga crowd. They were so comfortable and resembled street clothes, which saved me time and money at the laundromat.\u000a\u000aI get hives when I think of a leotard renaissance attempted by clothiers like American Apparel, a scandal-plagued company that recently closed more than a hundred stores. (It was the curse of the leo!) So do many of my colleagues, fellow fitness instructors whose careers started decades before mine.\u000a\u000aRecently, I conducted a leo-poll to remind millennials how grateful they should be to those who sacrificed convenience to pave the way from leos to Lululemon. Here are three things my fitness elders remember about their time in Lycra:\u000a\u000aLeotard-wearers burn more calories in the bathroom than on the dance floor . I\u2019ll let this unsavory fact sink in as I tell you about one of my mentors, a Baby Boomer whose aerobics career began in 1978. This woman has all the signs of bodysuit trauma, including hysterical laughter at the mere mention of a leotard. To conceal her identity\u2014and keep her safe in the leotard witness protection program\u2014I will call her \u201cJennifer.\u201d Jennifer, who can still rock a step aerobics routine without falling off the bench, says leotards were tools of her trade, a new profession that didn\u2019t even require certifications. Being a fitness instructor then was like embracing the Wild West. Instead of tumbleweeds, they had leg lifts. But when it came time to tinkle, everything had to come off: sweaty bodysuit, tights and underwear. What an inconvenience to a person who also stays hydrated. As leotards got smaller, underwear stayed the same size . Here\u2019s what Jennifer says about that: \u201c We didn\u2019t wear thongs or go commando in those days, so your underwear had to fit under it. Hence, we had \u2018high leg\u2019 bikinis in white, beige or black. You wore \u2014 in this order \u2014 your underwear (with a sanitary napkin if needed because who wore tampons back then?), your pink or beige tights and your leotard.\u201d Yuck. Before Madonna, your bra had to hide under your leotard. And yes, bras only came in white, beige or black. Another fitness professional \u2014whom I\u2019ll call Debbie\u2014said she had to wear a sports bra underneath her leotard because shelf bras hadn\u2019t been invented yet. But unlike Jennifer, Debbie avoided panty lines by going sans . Instead of wearing her leo over her tights, she pulled her tights over her leotard to avoid \u201cride up.\u201d Don\u2019t get Jennifer or Debbie started about yeast infections, a major hazard, especially before the birth of the cotton crotch. Like snowflakes, each leotard had its own personality that had to stand alone without legwarmers or belts. Here\u2019s what Jennifer says about hers: \u201cMy favorite leotard, which I still have, is grey with a short skirt attached. Very flattering. I still wear it today, on Halloween.\u201d Debbie, who has banished all leotards from her drawer, remembers technological advances in fabric, from cotton and nylon to Spandex and wicking material. Usually, she wore spaghetti straps or tank style, but when she choreographed a dance exercise video in 1989, thongs were the height of fashion. Yet like Pangaea, the supercontinent that separated into individual landmasses, leotards were beginning to break apart into ( gasp ) briefs and sports bras. Debbie remembers her dancers were to wear thong briefs underneath thick footless tights for the video. On top, they were going to wear midriff shirts to show their toned bellies. Jennifer added that women with skinny back sides have no business wearing thongs and that we should all meditate on that.\u000a\u000aToday, Jennifer and Debbie have occasional leotard flashbacks. But mostly, they embrace tank tops, shorts and leggings when they teach classes. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with a thong as outerwear, they agree there\u2019s nothing right either.\u000a\u000aAnn Votaw is a freelance writer in New York who has a M.A. in Health Education. She teaches yoga and physical fitness to adults 60 and better.

aVIn today\u2019s market, it\u2019s not all together unusual for an artwork to surface at an auction and sell for thousands, even millions, more than what it was initially worth when it was first produced. Case in point, Pop artist Andy Warhol\u2019s famous \u201cBrillo Box\u201d sculpture, which is now the subject of a forthcoming HBO documentary, titled BRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) and premiering August 7, according to a press release.\u000a\u000aThe film traces the epic story of one of Warhol\u2019s original, signed Brillo Boxes, first bought in 1969 for $1,000 by newlywed art collectors Martin and Rita Skyler, and after an impressive, successive list of owners (including Gagosian gallery founding director Robert Shapazian and Charles Saatchi) the work was eventually sold at Christie\u2019s in 2010 for just over $3 million.\u000a\u000aHow could an artwork, seemingly simple in its construction and concept and lampooned by critics, accumulate so much in value over the span of forty years? Martin and Rita\u2019s daughter Lisanne, who has written, directed and produced the new film, seeks to find an answer by closely following the Brillo\u2019s Box\u2019s story, from its early years in her family\u2019s home to the stunningly 2010 sale at Christie\u2019s.\u000a\u000aSkyler\u2019s film captures reactions from her parents as they recall discovering the remarkable rise in value of the artwork they traded in 1971 in exchange for a piece by Peter Young, as well as expert analysis from Christie\u2019s chairman of the Americans Laura Paulson, Philadelphia Museum of Art curator Jessica Todd Smith, Warhol Museum former director Eric Shiner and critic and historian Irving Sandler, among others.\u000a\u000aBRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) will premiere on HBO the day after what would have been Warhol\u2019s 89th birthday, at 10 p.m. ET.

aVIn the age of the \u201cobesity epidemic,\u201d more research than ever is focused on determining safe, effective, and long-lasting ways to help prevent or reverse unhealthy weight gain. And studies have found that one possible solution is following a very-low carbohydrate diet called the ketogenic diet.\u000a\u000aThe keto diet drastically reduces the body\u2019s supply of glucose\u2014which is typically obtained from eating carbohydrate-heavy foods like grains and sugar\u2014instead forcing the body to use fat for energy. That may sound similar to other low-carb diets, but there is one key keto distinction: Instead of a focus on lots of protein, the keto diet emphasizes healthy fats, mostly from keto-approved foods like coconut or olive oil, butter, meat, avocado, and eggs.\u000a\u000aFor this reason, the keto diet doesn\u2019t just help with weight loss. It\u2019s also been shown to reduce the risk for diabetes or heart disease, protect against certain neurological disorders, and improve cognitive function. But that doesn\u2019t mean that adopting the keto diet will be all smooth sailing, either. For many, the transition from a high-carb diet to one that\u2019s built around healthy fats and plenty of vegetables can trigger some side effects.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re considering adopting the keto diet to help improve your overall health, be advised that you may run into one or more of the following challenges. The good news, however, is that most of these will very likely dissipate within several weeks\u2014or even sooner if you follow my advice.\u000a\u000aConstipation\u000a\u000aBecause you\u2019ll be eating far less carbohydrates than you\u2019re used to while on a keto diet, you\u2019ll likely also be decreasing the amount of fiber in your diet. This can contribute to various digestive changes, including constipation. To help keep things \u201cmoving,\u201d drink plenty of water and make sure to eat a variety of low-carb plant foods throughout the day, especially high-fiber veggies like leafy greens, cooked cruciferous veggies and avocado.\u000a\u000aYou may also want to supplement with a digestive enzyme, particularly one that contains the enzyme lipase. Lipase is the primary enzyme that breaks down dietary fats, which will help with all of the extra avocado and coconut oil you\u2019ll likely be consuming.\u000a\u000aLow energy\u000a\u000aMany metabolic changes need to take place in your body in order for you to switch from using fat for fuel instead of glucose. And while this process unfolds, it\u2019s common to experience periods of fatigue, weakness, and brain fog as your body reserves energy for the aforementioned metabolic processes.\u000a\u000aOne way to help keep your energy up is to make sure that you\u2019re not dehydrated and that you\u2019re also getting enough essential nutrients, especially electrolytes. Many keto dieters find that adding salt to their meals and having some bone broth on a daily basis helps to restore some of the electrolytes that are lost during ketosis, including magnesium, potassium, and sodium. Bone broth also supplies a number of other important nutrients and amino acids, while decreasing potential side effects like muscle wasting, headaches, cramping, and spasms.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, you should aim to sleep at least eight hours per night and go lighter on your schedule during this transition period, which should prevent you from feeling even more stressed and run down. If you can\u2019t seem to sleep well, try these natural tips to fall asleep fast, or try taking about 400 milligrams of magnesium citrate before bed.\u000a\u000aMuscle weakness\u000a\u000aIn addition to feeling more tired than normal on the keto diet, you may also experience decreased strength, difficulty recovering from a tough workout, and/or general weakness. For this reason, I recommend saving any intense training sessions for when you\u2019re feeling stronger and more energized\u2014especially if you\u2019re also dealing with signs of hypoglycemia (another potential side effect of ketosis), which can cause temporary shakiness, lightheadedness, and sweating.\u000a\u000aSo how can you combat this potential weakness? For starters, be sure to eat enough protein to fuel your body\u2014but not too much. On the keto diet, the total amount of protein needed is not very high, about 1.3 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight. If you suspect you\u2019re not eating enough overall, try having more non-starchy veggies and fat, instead of more protein, as an excess can lead to dehydration, mood swings and kidney issues (not to mention bad breath).\u000a\u000aTo replenish sodium levels\u2014if hypoglycemia is an issue\u2014you might also want to try having a glass of water with about one-quarter teaspoon of Himalayan or natural sea salt salt stirred in.\u000a\u000aIncreased cravings\u000a\u000aAccording to a 2007 report that appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, \u201cOne major advantage of the ketogenic diet is that it allows the calorie intake to be cut drastically without producing ravenous hunger.\u201d So even though your overall appetite may be decreased on the keto diet, the reality is that your cravings for carbs or sugar might not be.\u000a\u000aFood preferences and ingrained dietary habits can take some time to change, so it\u2019s expected that you might deal with some temporary symptoms of \u201cwithdrawal\u201d as you remove certain comfort foods from your diet. In many cases this might be more of an emotional issue than a physical symptom, so be patient with yourself and remember that your taste buds are capable of changing. Be sure to eat enough calories in general, and allow time for your preferences to sort themselves out, which will happen as you start feeling better overall.\u000a\u000aEating more healthy fats, fiber, and adequate amounts of lean protein will help kick those cravings, as will regular servings of probiotic-rich, fermented foods.\u000a\u000aMoodiness\u000a\u000aMany people don\u2019t realize just how connected their digestive system is to their nervous system. When your diet changes, so does the production of hormones and neurotransmitters that affect how you feel, sleep and behave. You might notice that for the first couple weeks on the keto diet you\u2019re feeling unmotivated and generally crummy, but this doesn\u2019t mean that the diet is doing harm.\u000a\u000aIn short, it takes time for your brain to adapt to its new energy source (remember: fat, not carbs), so hang in there. If symptoms like lack of sleep, sluggishness, or lingering headaches are contributing to your poor moods, try getting more magnesium from foods like leafy greens, avocado, and salmon to help. You should aim to eat at least two cups of raw, green, leafy vegetables per day, in addition to other non-starchy veggies that you enjoy.\u000a\u000aAlso, remember that meditation, exercise, and journaling are great, non-food ways to improve your mood fast.\u000a\u000aDr. Josh Axe, DNM, DC, CNS, is a doctor of natural medicine, clinical nutritionist and author with a passion to help people get well using food as medicine.

aVSen. Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys are asking to pause his corruption trial at certain points over the coming months so that the senator can travel to Washington, D.C., and vote on several high-profile bills.\u000a\u000aMenendez attorney Abbe Lowell filed a motion to alter the court schedule on Thursday. The trial is currently scheduled to start Sept. 6 and is expected to last into November, a timeline that could prevent the senator from voting on issues such as health care, raising the federal borrowing limit to avoid default and approving a spending plan to avert a government shutdown.\u000a\u000aA single vote can have a big impact in the closely divided Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats and Democrats 48. Menendez\u2019s legal team said that if the senator were absent for his trial, the jury could infer he does not care enough about the case.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to members of Congress especially \u2026 they have a constitutional right to be an active part of every minute of their trial, but they also have constitutional obligations to serve the people who elected them,\u201d Menendez\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cIf a non-public official chooses not to attend his or her trial, the jury may draw whatever inference it wants, including that the defendant did not care enough about his or her case. However, this is not a proper or accurate inference here, and the court can and should take appropriate steps to prevent the prejudice that might come with such an incorrect inference.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Department of Justice opposed Menendez\u2019s motion in a filing late on Thursday night, arguing that he was trying to get special treatment from the court that no other defendant could request and was trying \u201cto hide behind the very office he corrupted to avoid accountability to the public for his actions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA critical aspect of our criminal justice system is that every defendant should be treated equally and no defendant should receive special treatment based on power, position or privilege,\u201d said Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman. \u201cThe department is fully prepared to proceed to trial on September 6.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a response to that filing, Menendez\u2019s attorneys said conflicts would only crop up occasionally and would at most affect a few days of the trial.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe senator is not seeking special treatment for himself, and cutting a few days of trial short so he can return to Washington for key votes would not benefit him in any personal way,\u201d the response said. \u201cAdding an occasional day or half day for a critical vote would not be difficult. For the prosecutors to object to even a brief delay, after they took over two years to bring this case and all the time spent on important judicial review of their charges, is a weak point to make.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. District Judge William H. Walls has not ruled on Menendez\u2019s motion. If Menendez were convicted and resigned, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, would be able to fill his seat. Christie\u2019s term ends in mid-January.\u000a\u000aMenendez is currently facing charges that he accepted bribes from wealthy donor Salomon Melgen, who has been convicted in a separate case of defrauding Medicare and is now a co-defendant in the senator\u2019s trial.

aVHaving access to the nuclear \u201cfootball\u201d is the ultimate power of the American president. With it, you can kill millions inside an hour and perhaps even end the world as we know it. Only one president, Harry Truman, had to exercise that authority when he dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to end the Second World War.\u000a\u000aTruman did so with a heavy heart but as a veteran of the last world war\u2014he was the only president in the last century to have seen ground combat up-close, in the hell of the Meuse Argonne in the fall of 1918\u2014he knew he had little choice. Every president since Truman has accepted that he, too, might have to sign off on nuclear release. There is no weightier possibility for any White House.\u000a\u000aFor months, commentators have wondered if Donald J. Trump is up for such an enormous burden. His sometimes bizarre and combative public utterances have rendered this question in-bounds for the fair-minded. This hardly seems like a man who is mentally configured to take the stresses of, say, the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, when Washington and Moscow came alarmingly close to nuclear release on each other.\u000a\u000aNow prominent national security mavens are saying publicly what they\u2019ve been musing privately since Trump\u2019s inauguration seven months ago. This burst into public view in response to Trump\u2019s barn-burning speech in Phoenix on Tuesday night. As the White House circles wagons in the face of mounting inquiries about his ties to the Kremlin, the president has pandered to his hard core base of supporters that will stick by his side, come what may.\u000a\u000aThe Phoenix rally therefore witnessed fiery oratory even by Trump\u2019s standards. The president threatened to shut down the federal government to pay for his promised \u201cwall\u201d on the Mexican border. He misrepresented his controversial response to the bloody fracas in Charlottesville, presenting himself as the innocent victim of media bias and its \u201csick people.\u201d He attacked the \u201cfake news\u201d in a combative and rambling manner throughout the speech. He repeatedly lambasted \u201cthe elite,\u201d which the president explained \u201care trying to take away our history and our heritage.\u201d In a classic Trumpian outburst, the president compared his housing to theirs: \u201cThey\u2019re elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile these utterances perhaps played well with Trump\u2019s dwindling fanbase, they appalled many Americans. Perceptive commentary on the Phoenix rally came from James Clapper, who until the beginning of this year was our director of National Intelligence, a post he held for a record six and a half years. On CNN, Clapper didn\u2019t mince words about the president\u2019s fiery oratory, saying, \u201cI really question his ability, his fitness to be in this office, and I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it. Maybe he is looking for a way out. I do wonder, as well about the people that are attracted to this, to this rally as others. You know, what are they thinking? Or why am I so far off base? Because I don\u2019t understand the adulation. Of course, that\u2019s why I think he gravitated to having this rally, as ill-timed as it is.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen explicitly asked if the president constitutes a threat to our national security, Clapper\u2019s response was important and revealing: \u201cWell, he certainly could be. Again, having some understanding of the levers that a president can exercise, I worry about, frankly, you know, the access to the nuclear codes.\u201d\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s be perfectly clear here: Jim Clapper, a retired Air Force three-star general, is the most experienced American intelligence officer of his generation, boasting more than a half-century in the spy business, including heading two Pentagon intelligence agencies as well as serving as the boss of the whole Intelligence Community. This is a sober and wise man not given to wild outbursts. And this week he stated he is worried about President Trump having access to our nuclear codes.\u000a\u000aIn truth, senior national security types have discussed this touchy matter quietly among themselves ever since Trump unexpectedly won the election last November. Quite a few of them have said what Clapper did\u2014but not on camera. Further, not many of these worried generals, admirals and spy-bosses are Democrats or liberals.\u000a\u000aThe good news, such as it is, is that three generals of impeccable quality surround Trump. Two very level-headed retired Marine four-star generals, Jim Mattis and John Kelly, serve as the secretary of defense and White House chief of staff, respectively, while the National Security Council is headed by H.R. McMaster, a still-serving Army three-star general. Together, the theory goes, these three battle-hardened warriors can talk sense into the president in any hour of crisis.\u000a\u000aBut is that really true? After all, our atomic imbroglio with North Korea, featuring leaders in Washington and Pyongyang howling juvenile threats at each other, could easily fly out of control, notwithstanding that Beijing\u2019s admonition to Kim and Trump to cut out the crazy talk seems to have worked\u2014at least for now. In practice, it would be exceptionally difficult to prevent a president from launching nuclear weapons if he really wanted to.\u000a\u000aThere is precedent that may be relevant. In the waning days of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s presidency, when the wolves of Watergate howled at the Oval Office door and the commander-in-chief drank heavily as a form of escape, our top national security folks took appropriate measures. In the summer of 1974, weeks before Nixon\u2019s resignation, Defense Secretary James Schlesinger quietly informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff that any orders from the White House regarding nuclear release were to be ignored.\u000a\u000aWe may be approaching a similar situation. It\u2019s easy to imagine Mattis, Kelly and McMaster putting our national security\u2014and avoiding a nuclear holocaust\u2014above the whims of our increasingly angry president, who seems obsessed with his enemies, both real and imagined. Whether Trump would listen is another question. All that seems certain right now is that the president shows no sign of backing down or becoming less like himself. This morning, he insulted Jim Clapper in a fiery tweet, as has become the custom in this administration. A genuine civil-military crisis may be headed our way, perhaps sooner than many realize.\u000a\u000aJohn Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer.

aV50. Black Frame Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 30 Leadership: Brian Phillips, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 With clients that read like the guest list at a party where you won't get in, Black Frame's built a mystique as a luxury PR firm with one foot firmly planted downtown. Think Visionaire, Rodarte, Opening Ceremony and uber-interior-designers Yabu Pushelberg. Bonus points for naming its website Framenoir.\u000a\u000a49. Allison + Partners Last Year\u2019s List: 41 Employees: 300 Leadership: Scott Allison, co-founder, chairman and CEO Revenue: $46 million Founded: 2001 Despite the firm's SF roots, Allison + Partners' center of gravity has shifted to the Big Apple, now home to the largest team in its global network. Talent's where the firm is ruling; hires have landed from places like Edelman and Ogilvy. And the client roster's been fattened by the likes of Samsung, Adecco and Seventh Generation.\u000a\u000a48. The Magrino Agency Last Year\u2019s List: 47 Employees: N/A Leadership: Susan Magrino, chairman and CEO; Allyn Magrino, president and COO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 Susan and Allyn Magrino have built a lifestyle-PR powerhouse, with clients who now involve them in brand strategy before a product even launches. It's also a matchmaking pioneer, connecting, say, Richard Meier with Dom Perignon for a special edition. Despite brutal competition from upstarts like M18, the firm's more than held its own, with a food-hospitality-fashion stable that includes Baccarat, Lavazza, Hilton properties and Turnberry Isle.\u000a\u000a47. Boneau/Bryan-Brown Last Year\u2019s List: 44 Employees: 16 Leadership: Chris Boneau, Adrian Bryan-Brown, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 More than 200 BBB clients have won Tony Awards, cementing its place as the top name in theatre PR. Broadway\u2019s biggest hits, including The Book of Mormon and Jersey Boys, rely on the firm\u2019s smart strategy\u2014and upcoming partnerships with Cirque du Soleil and Nickelodeon mean BBB clients will continue to be conversation starters. Still, we're watching to see how DKC's acquisition of O & M affects the category (see DKC listing).\u000a\u000a46. High10 Media Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Lisa Dallos, CEO; Evan Strome, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 Lisa Dallos' media-centric firm is the only one whose team includes one employee in Maine and one in Tel Aviv. Whatever\u2014the firm's been killing it for media brands from Adweek to the Webby and Clio Awards to The Hill and New Republic magazines. And if you're wondering why the sale of a Manhattan gay bar rag to an L.A. media group was featured in the Hollywood Reporter this year, thank Ms. Dallos.\u000a\u000a45. APCO Worldwide Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Margery Kraus, founder and executive chairman Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 What started as a wonky D.C. agency has mushroomed into a brainy powerhouse with clients like IKEA, Wyndham hotels, and Microsoft, and leadership like ex-WSJ editor Kevin Goldman; from a staff of five, its NYC office now employs 50 and counting.\u000a\u000a44. Baltz & Company Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 29 Leadership: Phillip Baltz, founder and president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1998 With a profile so low he's practically underground, Phillip Baltz prefers to let his work do the talking. You would, too, with superstar restaurant clients like Dirt Candy, Pearl & Ash, Jonathan Waxman\u2019s JAMS, Beauty and Essex, Kat & Theo and...Chipotle.\u000a\u000a43. Dukas Linden Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Richard Dukas, chairman and CEO; Seth Linden, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2002 Dukas may have cost John Paulson $500 million this year. That wasn't its retainer; DLPR client Carson Block, a prominent short-seller, famously took down Chinese timber outfit Sino-Forest Corp., which subsequently tanked. Dukas itself had a better 2015, coming off the best stretch in its 13-year history\u2014and cracking $5 million for the first time. Broadcast is where the agency shines; if you're ever tuned into Bloomberg TV, CNBC or Fox, you've probably seen one of the 60-plus segments the firm books monthly for clients like Raymond James, EisnerAmper and Eaton Vance.\u000a\u000a42. The Peggy Siegal Company Last Year\u2019s List: 40 Employees: N/A Leadership: Peggy Siegal, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 If you want your movie to get into the Oscar race, it helps to have Peggy Siegal by your side. This year, the queen of film PR is handling publicity on both coasts for Spotlight and The Danish Girl, among others. Her secret? Lunchtime Q&As with top filmmakers, held at venues like the 21 Club. Ms. Siegal refers to these events as \u201ca press conference wrapped around a piece of chicken.\u201d\u000a\u000a41. PR Consulting Last Year\u2019s List: 30 Employees: N/A Leadership: Pierre Rougier, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 PR Consulting's website simply lists its clients. Since the agency's Sphinx-like about itself, we'll let the roster do the talking for founder Pierre Rougier: Hood by Air, Dior, Raf Simons, Rick Owens, LVMH, Dries Van Noten, Narciso Rodriguez, Christopher Kane, Versace. Oh, and Forever 21 and Joe Fresh. The firm's also expanded into food and hospitality, with Andre Balazs a notable client\u2014and it may be courting Grindr as well.\u000a\u000a40. Goodman Media Last Year\u2019s List: 19 Employees: 25 Leadership: Tom Goodman, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1996 Flashier firms may get the glory, but Tom Goodman's 25-person shop continues to get clients that matter, from The Economist to Grand Central Terminal to the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. A complete New York insider, founder Mr. Goodman surprised more than a few people by opening an office in Boston this year.\u000a\u000a39. Golin Last Year\u2019s List: 36 Employees: 1,000-plus Leadership: Fred Cook, CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 Golin likes to call its reps "nice guys who kick ass," and that was certainly true this year, as its campaigns focused on positivity, but still got plenty of eyeballs. Among the firm's 2015 triumphs: partnering with Toyota for the Special Olympics World Games (Golin was the brains behind that viral Google Doodle) and rolling out the McDonald\u2019s All Day Breakfast campaign.\u000a\u000a38. Nicholas & Lence Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 39 Employees: 12 Leadership: Cristyne Nicholas, CEO; George Lence, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2007 A quintessentially New York agency founded by deeply connected insiders, this firm represents city institutions like Michael Jordan's Steakhouse in Grand Central, the forthcoming New York Wheel on Staten Island, and Key Brand, the leading theater ticket seller, which owns brands like Broadway Box and Broadway.com. Does it get more New York than literally repping the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Foundation? Naturally, big city clients sometimes bring big city problems -- the Carnegie Deli has been closed since April when it was found to have an illegal gas hookup. But others\u2014like 2015 NASL Champions The NY Cosmos and Brookfield, the developer who led a successful opening of Brookfield Place and dipped a toe in Brooklyn\u2014show that an NYC-focused firm can punch way above its weight.\u000a\u000a37. MWW Last Year\u2019s List: 20 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Kempner, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1986 MWW has its feelers in just about every sector of PR\u2014its many clients with commercial appeal include Verizon, Walgreens and JetBlue. It\u2019s also entered some areas other agencies fear to tread\u2014its LGBT wing, which represents It Gets Better, among others, looked particularly prescient after the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage equality ruling.\u000a\u000a36. Nasty Little Man Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 6 Leadership: Steve Martin, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 This firm may only have six employees, but its supernova clientele (Paul McCartney, David Bowie, U2) proves that in NYC PR, size doesn\u2019t always matter. Mr. Martin can be ferocious in defending his acts from unflattering coverage, including from his bête noir, the Observer\u2019s own Tim Sommer, but they love him for it. The Foo Fighters thought they were in big trouble when Dave Grohl broke his leg on the band\u2019s 20th anniversary tour, but once NLM rebranded it as the \u201cBroken Leg\u201d tour, the rockers continued to sell out stadiums.\u000a\u000a35. Paul Wilmot Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 32 Employees: N/A Leadership: Paul Wilmot, managing partner and chief executive Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 Paul Wilmot's august fashion and beauty firm always manages to stay cool by choosing clients carefully; this year, it lent its cachet to client Parlux Fragrances, creators of new scents from Rihanna and Sean Combs. Wilmot's forever relationships with Kate Spade, H&M and Lane Bryant also mean its third decade is already looking as strong as its first two.\u000a\u000a34. Brunswick Group Last Year\u2019s List: 29 Employees: N/A Leadership: Steven Lipin, senior partner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1987 Brunswick doesn't divulge client lists, but its reputation as an 800-pound gorilla in financial communications precedes it. This year, the multinational firm added former Bloomberg editor Laurie Hays to its NYC office, and its let-our-hair-down digital/creative subsidiaries like MerchantCantos, Brunswick Arts and Blaise Projects keep cranking.\u000a\u000a33. KCD Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Ed Filipowski, worldwide president and chief strategist; Julie Mannion, president of creative services Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 KCD is a fashion Goliath whose industry-defining clients include style-section habitués like Alexander Wang, Balmain, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang and Tory Burch. Along with publicity, the agency produces shows, which means it wields serious power; KCD decides where everyone's seated.\u000a\u000a32. ID-PR Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 100 Leadership: Kelly Bush Novak, founder and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1993 The ubiquity of client Serena Williams this summer\u2014how many magazine covers did she get?\u2014was just one example of ID\u2019s juice. Building on its roots in celeb/entertainment PR, where it still shines, the firm's making serious inroads with consumer and luxury brands, from Coca-Cola, AOL and Marriott to Westfield World Trade Center and Tiffany. Philanthropy's the next frontier: this year saw massive campaigns for deep-pocketed do-gooders like Unicef and Sean Penn's J/P HRO.\u000a\u000a30. 5W PR Last Year\u2019s List: 35 Employees: 125 Leadership: Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO Revenue: $21.5 million Founded: 2003 A generalist firm with fingers in the right pies\u2014from health care and hedge funds to tech and travel\u20145W's roster includes uber-New Yorky brands like Duane Reade, the Greater NY Taxi Association and Derek Jeter's Stop!t, along with global heavyweights like Unilever, L'Oreal and Krups. Founder Ronn Torossian claims the firm's revenue could double within five years; we don't doubt it. He also brokered an unlikely peace between Mayor de Blasio and client Sergeant\u2019s Benevolent Association.\u000a\u000a29. Sunshine Sachs Last Year\u2019s List: 1 Employees: 154 Leadership: Ken Sunshine, Shawn Sachs, Heather Lylis, Keleigh Thomas Morgan, partners Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 How could they? That was the reaction to Sunshine Sachs' much-publicized Wikipedia screwup. It's a shame that the incident defined the agency's year, since last year's No. 1 firm is still having an incredible ride with giant nonprofit clients, A+ celebrities and massive growth in live events, like iHeartRadio's nationwide festivals. But it\u2019ll be a while before chatter stops about the Wikipedia episode.\u000a\u000aThey may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world. Hotels, its original client base, still bed down with M18 in droves. Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a11. M18 Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Tavani and Meghan McGinnis, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 They may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world.

Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a27. Nadine Johnson Inc. Last Year\u2019s List: 21 Employees: N/A Leadership: Nadine Johnson, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1995 Ms. Johnson's agency famously doesn't divulge client names, but it's known for sexy/artsy brands like Ace Hotels along with galleries, architects and high-end residential projects. The agency's still got serious juice, but suffered a blow this year when arts practice leader Adam Abdalla left to start his own firm, Cultural Counsel, as the Observer reported in July (see sidebar). Stay tuned.\u000a\u000a26. Shore Fire Media Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Marilyn Laverty, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1990 The rotating playlist on Shore Fire\u2019s homepage speaks volumes about the firm\u2019s reach; Bonnie Raitt, Lana Del Rey, Zac Brown, Carole King, Brandi Carlile, Elvis Costello, Tedeschi Trucks Band and St. Vincent are all clients. In its 25th year, this music PR pioneer saw its clients grab the No. 1 spots on the Billboard, iTunes, Apple Music and Amazon charts. This year, Shore Fire expanded its repertoire with non-music clients like publishing mogul Maria Rodale and Tuesdays with Morrie author Mitch Albom. Shore Fire was also one of the first communications firms to HQ itself in Brooklyn; the move seems prescient now.\u000a\u000aWhat does $6.5 trillion look like? Ask Jennifer Prosek. That\u2019s the asset management client base advised by Prosek Partners\u2014and it\u2019s $1.5 billion more than last year. But Prosek\u2019s not getting complacent. The firm\u2019s just added supernova clients like Bloomberg, TDBank, Goldman Sachs, MetLife and TIAA. It lured Finsbury\u2019s former US CEO, Andy Merrill, as a partner. And the acquisition of Los Angeles-based Muirfield Partners extended the firm\u2019s reach. Icing: Prosek expects 25 percent year over year growth.\u000a\u000a22.

Stu Loeser & Co Last Year\u2019s List: 15 Employees: 8 Leadership: Stu Loeser, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 2012 Mayor de Blasio lost several big fights this year, but two of the most visible were his loss of control of city schools and his failed attempt to cap Uber expansion in the city. It\u2019s no coincidence that both Uber and the charter school lobby were represented by Stu Loeser, the former Bloomberg press secretary who continues to have an outsize influence on city politics thanks to his small but mighty firm. But Mr. Loeser recently attracted some unwanted attention for his work on behalf of a non-union supermarket in the Hamptons.\u000a\u000a23. Becca PR Last Year\u2019s List: 27 Employees: N/A Leadership: Becca Parrish, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 2006 Becca Parrish has been fiercely loyal to clients like Le Bernardin, Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar and April Bloomfield's Spotted Pig, and they've returned the favor with long-standing relationships. New restaurateurs like Houseman\u2019s Ned Baldwin and Gabriel Kreuther have made her the go-to guru for launches. Now, with an L.A. office, she's branching into hotels and real estate.\u000a\u000a22. Makovsky Last Year\u2019s List: 7 Employees: 60 Leadership: Kenneth D. Makovsky, president Revenue: $15 million Founded: 1979 One of the top names in independent generalist PR, this firm\u2019s most high-profile clients include A.T. Kearney, Western Union and GlaxoSmithKline. Some of its biggest strides, however, have been in health\u2014celebs like Kim Kardashian and Kurt Warner have added their cachet to Makovsky\u2019s advocacy campaigns, and the firm pays it forward by fundraising for programs like LGBT Spirit Day.\u000a\u000a21. SKDKnickerbocker Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 80 Leadership: Josh Isay and Jennifer Cunningham, managing directors Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 Corporate clients like Facebook and Microsoft continue to pay dividends for SKDK, but sadly its clients were in the news this year more for adversarial situations. The firm helped Starbucks save face after its \u201cRace Together\u201d campaign, and is currently helping Planned Parenthood out of the hole caused by its videos (see sidebar). For partners Josh Isay, Hilary Rosen and Jennifer Cunningham, though, it\u2019s been unicorns and rainbows; in October, the Stagwell Group, a private equity firm funded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, bought their firm.\u000a\u000aalso gives back to the community through partnerships with Success Academy charter schools and crowdfunding giant Indiegogo.\u000a\u000aBilly Bush also retained him to take the spotlight off him after the release of the Donald Trump tape.

Never one to rest on its laurels, however, the firm continued to grow in 2015, with new clients like Children\u2019s Place and Vitamin Shoppe. And it's all grounded in founder Liz Kaplow's refreshingly high-touch philosophy.\u000a\u000a17.

The big old legacy agency\u2019s behaving more like a startup, with its new Studio B content arm, a groundbreaking Cuba task force focused on foreign economic development and tourism and a cybersecurity-focused partnership with former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge\u2019s Ridge Global. Burson\u2019s cranking out new business, too; Oracle, FedEx, Pitney Bowes, PPG Architectural Coatings and Texas Health Resources all came on board this year. And Burson head Don Baer\u2019s been relentless about recruiting, with a boatload of fresh C-level talent in the stable.\u000a\u000aBrad Pitt.

They\u2019re not just guarding reputations, but active partners in nurturing them.\u000a\u000aPerhaps most significantly, they\u2019re breaking down boundaries to become key partners across the marketing spectrum, muscling in on territory once dominated by ad agencies, digital firms and content producers.\u000a\u000aAt a time when content reigns, \u201cPublic relations agencies are now regarded as stewards of the whole communications strategy,\u201d says Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick (No. 2 on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list). \u201cPR practitioners have never been held in higher regard.\u201d\u000a\u000aEver-expanding opportunities across the marketing spectrum make this \u201cthe most exciting time there\u2019s ever been for the business,\u201d says Don Baer, worldwide chair and CEO of Burson-Marsteller (No. 17). \u201cEveryone is veering into everyone else\u2019s lane. And if you have the creativity, and the ability to execute, it\u2019s a time of great possibilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat matters most is who owns a great idea, agrees Sean Cassidy, CEO of DKC, the No. 1 agency on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list.\u000a\u000a\u201cClients will pay you now for a whole scope of services that you never would have done 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Cassidy says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re winning now is large-scale assignments. You\u2019re developing multi-platform communications plans with wide content, owned media, social pieces. We\u2019ve got a branding arm that\u2019s creating collateral and advertising, and we\u2019re doing more events than ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore firms are also building their own synergies with standalone agencies within agencies. At celebrity power shop PMK*BNC, a mini-firm called Vowel is creating viral content through which the agency\u2019s superstar celebrity clients often get paired with big brands in the PMK stable. A now-legendary piece for Audi starring Zachary Quinto and the late Leonard Nimoy was unleashed before the last Star Trek movie.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was wonderful, creative digital content that was storyboarded start to finish under our roof,\u201d says Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of PMK*BNC (No. 8). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of freedom out there for you and your clients. You just have to know what trail you want to go on.\u201d PMK markets Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cLenny Letter\u201d, which has become a huge viral hit in an area where a traditional firm wouldn\u2019t have ventured even five years ago.\u000a\u000aAn unintended consequence of this push and pull\u2014convergence and diffusion\u2014has been the resurgence of legacy agencies, which many had dismissed as dinosaurs once the landscape started shifting a few years ago.\u000a\u000aInstead, they learned to adapt, meshing cool new tools and lingo with their own gravitas as the grownups in the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe bring the judgment and experience that goes along with strategic thinking,\u201d says Mr. Baer of Burson, which launched a content arm called StudioB this year. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seasoning it with data, creativity and deep knowledge of media landscape. We\u2019re moving forward very assertively.\u201d\u000a\u000aSixty-seven-year-old Ruder Finn (No. 10), not long ago one of the stodgiest of the big players, has reinvented itself as a hip think tank, where clients get help with employee engagement, recruitment and even how their businesses are organized. \u201cWe call it ideation behind transformation,\u201d says CEO Kathy Bloomgarden, one of the few agency heads with a Ph.D. \u201cWe work to transform companies to make them more attractive to stakeholders both inside and outside. We sometimes help them change their culture.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll of it comes back to storytelling, says Weber Shandwick\u2019s Mr. Polansky, which is why PR firms should continue to rule.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreative is still king,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are looking for big ideas that are going to move the needle for their businesses, have an impact on how people think about their brands and influence decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s list reflects that.\u000a\u000aA word on methodology: Unlike other rankings, the Observer doesn\u2019t rely solely on size or revenue. We visit offices, meet agency leaders, confer with fellow journalists and keep an eye on news. The PR Power 50 list is as much about mojo, influence, innovation and chutzpah\u2014but not too much, as last year\u2019s No. 1 winner learned\u2014as it is about billables.\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t that what the business is about, too?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVIn July 1943, one month after a race riot shook Detroit, Vice President Henry Wallace spoke to a crowd of union workers and civic groups:\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot fight to crush Nazi brutality abroad and condone race riots at home. Those who fan the fires of racial clashes for the purpose of making political capital here at home are taking the first step toward Nazism.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Pittsburgh Courier, a leading African-American newspaper at the time, praised Wallace for endorsing what they called the \u201cDouble V\u201d campaign. The Double Victory campaign, launched by the Courier in 1942, became a rallying cry for black journalists, activists and citizens to secure both victory over fascism abroad during World War II and victory over racism at home.\u000a\u000aThere is a historical relationship between Nazism and white supremacy in the United States. Yet the recent resurgence of explicit racism, including the attack in Charlottesville, has been greeted by many with surprise. Just look at the #thisisnotwhoweare hashtag.\u000a\u000aAs a scholar of African-American history, I am troubled by the collective amnesia in U.S. politics and media around racism. It permeates daily interactions in communities across the country. This ignorance has consequences. When Americans celebrate the country\u2019s victory in WWII, but forget that the U.S. armed forces were segregated, that the Red Cross segregated blood donors or that many black WWII veterans returned to the country only to be denied jobs or housing, it becomes all the more difficult to talk honestly about racism today.\u000a\u000aNazis and Jim Crow\u000a\u000aAs Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime rose to power in the 1930s, black-run newspapers quickly recognized that the Third Reich saw the American system of race law as a model. Describing a plan to segregate Jews on German railways, the New York Amsterdam News wrote that Nazis were \u201ctaking a leaf from United States Jim Crow practices.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Chicago Defender noted that \u201cthe practice of jim-crowism has already been adopted by the Nazis.\u201d A quote from the official newspaper of the SS, the Nazi paramilitary organization, on the origins of the railway ban stated:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the freest country in the world, where even the president rages against racial discrimination, no citizen of dark color is permitted to travel next to a white person, even if the white is employed as a sewer digger and the Negro is a world boxing champion or otherwise a national hero\u2026[this] example shows us all how we have to solve the problem of traveling foreign Jews.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn making connections between Germany and the United States, black journalists and activists cautioned that Nazi racial ideology was not solely a foreign problem. A New York Amsterdam News editorial argued in 1935:\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Swastika is an emblem of racial oppression, the Stars and Stripes are equally so. This country has consistently refused to recognize one-tenth of its population as an essential part of humanity\u2026It has systematically encouraged the mass murder of these people through bestial mobs, through denial of economic opportunity, through terrorization.\u201d\u000a\u000aVictory at home\u000a\u000aWhen the United States entered WWII, African-Americans joined the fight to defeat fascism abroad. Meanwhile, the decades-long fight on the home front for equal access to employment, housing, education and voting rights continued.\u000a\u000aThese concerns prompted James G. Thompson, a 26-year-old from Wichita, Kansas, to write to the editors of the Pittsburgh Courier. His letter sparked the Double Victory campaign. Considering his service in the U.S. Army, which was racially segregated during WWII, Thompson wrote:\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing an American of dark complexion and some 26 years, these questions flash through my mind: \u2018Should I sacrifice my life to live half American?\u2019 \u2018Will things be better for the next generation in the peace to follow?\u2019\u2026\u2018Is the kind of America I know worth defending?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Thompson and other African-Americans, defeating Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was only half the battle. Winning the war would be only a partial victory if the United States did not also overturn racial discrimination at home.\u000a\u000aThese ideals seemed particularly far away in the summer of 1943, when racial violence raged across the country. In addition to the riot in Detroit, there were more than 240 reports of interracial battles in cities and at military bases, including in Harlem, Los Angeles, Mobile, Philadelphia and Beaumont, Texas.\u000a\u000aThese events inspired Langston Hughes\u2019 poem, \u201cBeaumont to Detroit: 1943\u201d:\u000a\u000a\u201cLooky here, America / What you done done / Let things drift / Until the riots come [\u2026] You tell me that hitler / Is a mighty bad man / I guess he took lessons from the ku klux klan [\u2026] I ask you this question / Cause I want to know / How long I got to fight / BOTH HITLER \u2014 AND JIM CROW.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe end of Hughes\u2019 poem calls to mind the swastikas and Confederate flags that were prominently displayed in Charlottesville and at other white supremacist rallies. These symbols and ideologies have long and intertwined histories in the U.S.\u000a\u000aAdvocates of the Double Victory campaign understood that Nazism would not be completely vanquished until white supremacy was defeated everywhere. In linking fascism abroad and racism at home, the Double Victory campaign issued a challenge to America that remains unanswered.\u000a\u000aMatthew Delmont is the Director and a Professor of the School of Historical, Philosophical & Religious Studies at Arizona State University.

aVIn Julian Schnabel: A Private Portrait, Schnabel is either talking or people close to him are talking about him. On a larger screen than his own large canvases, the artist paints, revisits his journey from Texas to New York, recalls the 1980s, dives off a high platform into the Mediterranean and paints some more.\u000a\u000aThe film is a cinematic portrait that features archival footage and is directed by Pappi Corsicato, a filmmaker whose work spans profiles of Richard Serra and investigations into the ruined city of Pompeii. Schnabel, who is credited as an executive producer, says there\u2019s no special reason why the film premiered last week at the Tribeca Film Festival and will open Friday at the Quad in Manhattan.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe the reason why it\u2019s coming out now is because it\u2019s finished now,\u201d said Schnabel, 65, sitting at a table with Corsicato in the skyscraper office of Cohen Media, a film distribution company founded by the real estate tycoon Charles Cohen, owner and renovator of the Quad.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to make a movie about me. What was important was that the work was shown. It\u2019s not trying to show something that\u2019s spectacular, but at least you can get a sense of the scale of the work,\u201d said Schnabel, who wore a warm-up jacket with a reproduction of one of his paintings on the back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI sort of feel like I\u2019m a broken vase, and that he picked up the pieces and put the vase together as best he could,\u201d he said, speaking about Corsicato. That\u2019s high praise from a man who has broken his share of plates.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a biography,\u201d said Schnabel, who told me he never intended to make a self-portrait on film. \u201cBut my father said to me, when I made a film about Jean-Michel Basquiat, that I should have made it about myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked Schnabel what he said to his father after that suggestion.\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018It\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u2019 \u201d he remembered saying.\u000a\u000aSchnabel also noted that he originally hadn\u2019t intended to make the film about Basquiat either. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a movie director,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when Jean-Michel died, a Polish movie director came to interview me about Jean-Michel. His name was Lech Majewski, and he had a pretty encyclopedic knowledge of film. But he was a tourist, and I knew Jean-Michel so well and I knew what the world was. I think one of the problems with movie-making is that people don\u2019t know their topic.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorsicato, a Neapolitan who knew Schnabel before he spent two years making the documentary, set his sights high when it came to making a documentary about the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s my vision of Julian\u2019s life. It\u2019s my personal point of view. It\u2019s like a story that you see in a movie. It\u2019s like a classic movie. In the beginning I was inspired by Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane, the little kid who becomes grand\u2014but from an artistic point of view. It\u2019s really like an American dream,\u201d he said in heavily accented English.\u000a\u000aI asked whether Corsicato saw Schnabel as Orson Welles or Charles Foster Kane.\u000a\u000aSchnabel spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe it\u2019s even more of a Fitzcarraldo kind of character, in the sense of what makes you do something that is ultimately illogical, like going to Sevilla and filling an abandoned monastery with paintings,\u201d Schnabel said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I do know is that history is a lie,\u201d Schnabel declared. \u201cEverybody has their version of history.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were there and they were there, and it\u2019s amazing how different their perception is of an event that occurred, but that\u2019s their truth,\u201d Schnabel said, looking at Corsicato. \u201cSomebody else would make a very different film. When he says that this is a private portrait, I would say that it\u2019s private to him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThroughout the film, family and friends recall Schnabel breaking rules and being true to his own creative spirit. Not a critical word is spoken, yet some recollections may come as a surprise. Jeff Koons, a contemporary, discusses how Schnabel helped him sell his first work of art.\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess it was nice that he said that. That\u2019s true, and I also got him his first exhibition,\u201d said Schnabel. \u201cWhen I first came to New York, nobody really helped me. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought it was good to help other people. It was pretty tough. Nobody really liked young artists in the \u201970s. I supported other artists, and I still do.\u201d\u000a\u000aTough times indeed. Shadowman, another documentary that revisits the 1980s art scene, made its world premiere at Tribeca and was runner-up for the festival\u2019s audience award. The subject is Richard Hambleton, whose graffiti daubs of threatening figures on the corners of buildings got him more attention than Keith Haring or Basquiat in the early 1980s. Hambleton, who attended his premiere in a wheelchair with a mask covering his cancer-ravaged face, struggled with drug addiction, then and now, and would disappear from public view for years at a time. In the film, Hambleton laments that, \u201cat least Basquiat died. I was alive when I died, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Hambleton story brought Schnabel back to the theme of success in the art market. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about apples and oranges. It depends on what you make,\u201d Schnabel noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many different lives,\u201d said Schnabel, who has made two films in his career about artists who died young: Basquiat and the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (Before Night Falls). \u201cLook, Vito Acconci died last night. Was Vito Acconci a successful artist? I would say he was. Was he a household name? Plenty of people who you talk to won\u2019t know who he was. But I can tell you how important he was,\u201d said Schnabel.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can look at an [Anselm] Kiefer painting which is very large, and people can understand why you might buy one of those and hang it in your house. But what about a Fat Chair by Joseph Beuys, which generated what Kiefer does?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same kind of marketability, because it\u2019s a peculiar object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeuys was a seminal influence for many artists\u2014Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Binky Palermo\u2014who were all his students. Yet when he died, his obituary might have said, \u2018the greatest artist on the north side of the street in Dusseldorf,\u2019 \u201d Schnabel added.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo many people around us have died\u2014Lou [Reed], David Bowie, and now Jonathan Demme. It\u2019s a death sentence being born. But what do you make out of it?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cSo if someone says that Keith [Haring], died and Jean-Michel died\u2014and it\u2019s certainly why his paintings got so expensive\u2014I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the answer to say, \u2018I\u2019d rather die before I get old,\u2019 like in the punk rock song.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked if he would be making another film of his own. The artist responded with the name of yet another artist who died young. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something about Vincent van Gogh. I\u2019m working with Jean-Claude Carriere,\u201d he said. Carriere, the veteran screenwriter, is one of many friends interviewed in Corsicato\u2019s documentary.\u000a\u000aVan Gogh\u2019s myth is securely in place, but I mentioned to Schnabel that Before Night Falls, his portrait of a martyr to Castro and to AIDS, is responsible for making Reinaldo Arenas and his poetry known to a far greater public than if the film had never been made.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping to do,\u201d he said, looking across the table at Corsicato, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s what this film will do for me.\u201d

aVIf you live in cities that don\u2019t exactly have multiple gym options, your life is about to be changed by ClassPass, the subscription service for boutique fitness workouts.\u000a\u000aWhen ClassPass launched, it sounded too good to be true\u2014probably because it was. In New York, those who signed up for the subscription service received unlimited boutique fitness classes for $99 a month, which was far less than a monthly membership at Equinox. Unfortunately, as prices quietly went up, quite a few New Yorkers were forced to commit to a certain workout. Finally, the unlimited option was discontinued. But it looks like despite the NYC drama, CP is expanding, this time launching in New Orleans, Pittsburgh and San Antonio with their pre-priced packages.\u000a\u000aThe company plans on offering their fitness services to 10 new cities within the next six months. The news comes after they announced $70 million in funding led by Temasek, guaranteeing they can continue partnering with boutique fitness studios for the foreseeable future. They currently work with more than 8,5000 studios and gyms across 31 cities in the US and eight cities internationally.\u000a\u000aDid your city make the list? Tag your friends in these 10 cities to let them know ClassPass is coming their way! A post shared by ClassPass (@classpass) on Aug 22, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT\u000a\u000aThe expansion is ideal for those who are always on business trips, as CP allows users to try different classes wherever they go. ClassPass is hinting at new ways to visit studios, promising a \u201cvariety for a more flexible membership\u201d in their press release. For example, the app recently announced that members can visit their favorite studios more than three times during their monthly cycle of classes.\u000a\u000aIn 2018, they plan on expanding to even more cities, some of which aren\u2019t exactly known for their love of boutique fitness classes, including Cincinnati, Calgary, Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Salt Lake City, with more announcements to come. If you happen to be a Midwest resident, make sure to sign up before the prices inevitably go up. That way, you can keep up with where and when all your gym buddies are working out.

aVAnalog Gems is a column highlighting movies and TV series that have not been released on DVD, Blu-ray or been out of print for too long.\u000a\u000aGRIM PRAIRIE TALES (1990)\u000a\u000aStarring James Earl Jones and Brad Dourif\u000a\u000aThe horror movie landscape is littered with films crying out for HD release, and one in particular that is truly deserving is the creepy Old West anthology Grim Prairie Tales. Written and directed by Wayne Coe , who had previous experience as a poster illustrator for movies like Out Of Africa and Back To The Future, the quirky pentalogy subverted Western movie themes in search of something different.\u000a\u000aThe conceit here is that city clerk Farley Deeds (Brad Dourif), who is making his way by horseback to Florida to see his wife and her ill mother, is joined at his prairie campfire by bounty hunter Morrison (James Earl Jones), who is transporting a scalped corpse on his horse. After his initial trepidation wanes, Farley engages in a sinister story swap session with his cantankerous visitor. The eerie narratives include a tale of a callous cowboy who disrespectfully passes through an Indian graveyard, a young traveler who seeks to aid a pregnant woman roaming the plains, a settler family whose patriarch harbors a dark secret, and a gunslinger who takes part in a gruesome showdown that haunts him long afterwards. The fifth story, of course, is the Deeds-Morrison summit.\u000a\u000aThe washed out copy uploaded onto YouTube does not include the introductory subtitle that was placed on the Academy Entertainment VHS release from 1990: \u201cHit The Trail\u2026To Terror.\u201d The film is understated in its fear factor, but at the time the video company released it, they were trying to place and promote it in one of the few categories in Blockbuster Video. So they skewed it towards horror.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was the marketing campaign, and it was very smart,\u201d acknowledges Coe when he speaks to me. \u201cWhen we released it, we didn\u2019t have a great tagline. But it turns out the market was college educated women. That makes perfect sense to me in retrospect.\u201d He recalls how Dourif sat him down and said, \u201cYou know this is a feminist Western.\u201d Indeed, many of the female characters hold the power while misogynist or racist men get their comeuppance. \u201cI had these attractive young women coming up to me after screenings going, \u2018I really loved your film.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Wow, what a singular audience for a horror-Western anthology,\u2019\u201d Coe said.\u000a\u000aWhile the film does not directly invoke the genocide of Native Americans or the stereotypical cowboys versus Indians trope, it does \u201cin a playful narrative manner, address cultural insensitivity, sexual repression, racism, violence as social transformer, and sexism,\u201d notes Coe. \u201cThese themes are on the mind of any conscientious American. They are equally on the minds on the negative side of every wealthy, militarized American colonialist who\u2019ve defined the western [genre].\u201d\u000a\u000aCoe, a California native who spent ten years living in Oklahoma during his youth, wrote a treatment for the film in 1984, which he titled Weird Two-Fisted Western. Self-taught, his seminal filmmaking experience was a project he made with high school friends in 1979 called PutnamCityMan, a 25-minute black and white Superman parody shot on 16mm film with a Bolex camera. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe never should have been able to make it. It was remarkably good. It had all these effects that you could do in camera.\u201d\u000a\u000aHaving made \u201cobscene amounts of money\u201d as an illustrator for Universal, and continuing to thrive on his own in the mid-1980s, he anticipated making Grim Prairie Tales by shooting one sequence per year for five years with his own funds. He would get it done regardless of the ultimate interest in the project. But by 1988 he and a producer and secured funding. During the writers\u2019 strike of that year, he spent three weeks shooting the four standalone stories in various locations near Los Angeles, including in the Mojave Desert and at Bob Hope\u2019s ranch. The film attracted a talented cast, like Marc McClure (Superman), William Atherton (Die Hard), and Michelle Joyner (Cliffhanger). In May 1989 Coe shot the essential interlacing sequences with James Earl Jones and Brad Dourif on a farm near the desert that they rented for $1,000 per day.\u000a\u000aDespite being a small film by a first-time director, Grim Prairie Tales landed the two leads who drove the film with their fun banter. Coe recalls that at the time Jones was worth around $300,000 per feature, although this role required far less screen time than usual. \u201cI think what was offered was $25,000 cash and $25,000 ownership in the film,\u201d says the director. \u201cHe happened to be available.\u201d At a meeting with Jones at his home, the famed thespian told Coe that his twisted tales reminded him of James Beckwourth, a mid-19th century author and \u201cprevaricator of tall Western tales.\u201d Jones liked the script and the footage they showed him, so he signed on.\u000a\u000aWhen Coe met Dourif, the actor \u201cdrove up in a motorcycle all dressed in leather with suitably long, hippy hair,\u201d he says. After securing Dourif, Coe sat down with him to go over every beat in every scene because his co-star was a Method actor. Jones was evidently the opposite. \u201cJames can turn it on. He just needs to know what emotion he is supposed to be dialing in.\u201d\u000a\u000aJones and Dourif no doubt were enticed by Coe\u2019s \u201canti-Western\u201d in which he shirked supernatural monster terror for more down-to-earth ideas. Coe was adamant in eschewing the familiar trope of \u201cthe xenophobic white man who rescue the woman who is threatened by the sexually deviant savage.\u201d He wanted to invert those ideas. In doing so, he \u201cunintentionally wrote a soft horror film that reaffirmed the power of women, which is completely cockeyed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of the way Academy Entertainment marketed it, but they moved 40,000 video units, which was the most that they moved that year of any video. It was their hit.\u201d According to Coe, it later became TV Guide\u2019s pick of the week and ran for years on cable.\u000a\u000aOne memorable sequence in the film came during the gunslinger story. It is an animated nightmare in which the killer imagines his screaming, miniaturized bullet-head loaded into the barrel of a gun and fired. When Coe asked for bids from animators for the surreal sequence, they ranged from $200,000 to $1.1 million. \u201cI had it storyboarded,\u201d explains Coe. \u201cThe entire budget for the film was $550,000, so we knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Production designer Anthony Zierhut suggested they just animate it themselves, which they did in three weeks for $2,500 during the nine-month post-production period.\u000a\u000aGrim Prairie Tales sold well on videotape after being self-distributed theatrically by East West Film Partners. Coe wrote a prequel called Grim Prairie Tales: Rescue Party in which Jones\u2019 character Morrison sought to rescue his kidnapped grandchild from his murderous son-in-law, Raymer. (Raymer was the corpse in the film.) That second installment never materialized. After Grim Prairie Tales came out, Coe did numerous commercial animations and started shooting music videos and sketch comedy. He worked on several screenplays throughout the 1990s and launched into a successful painting career in 2000.\u000a\u000aCoe\u2019s newest film project shifts from supernatural creepiness to very personal horror of a different sort. He is currently editing a documentary called We Have Your Kids, which was inspired by a political power struggle in the school system of Chatham, New York, where he resides with his wife and three children. One day, the school board \u201csuddenly announced that they were considering closing the middle school I look out my front door at,\u201d recalls Coe, who adds that it is a national award-winning school with numerous honor students.\u000a\u000aAs he investigated further through school board meetings and research, he learned that if the school closed, 350 students, including his kids, would be shuttled off to a school in a valley near where trains carrying explosives and incendiary materials frequently traveled through. The community was outraged, and yet the board voted 8 to 1 to close the school. Coe took it up as his cause. The director has a four-hour rough cut of We Have Your Kids that has cost $250,000 thus far. \u201cEveryone who sees the trailer and 15-minute clip thinks it is a really important subject,\u201d remarks Coe. He admits he is not an activist but just seeks to do what is right for the children.\u000a\u000aAs we wait for that film to emerge, we hope that Grim Prairie Tales can receive the Blu-ray release it deserves with a widescreen video disc that allows us to fully appreciate the movie\u2019s panoramic landscapes and dark imagery. By the way, this was the feature film debut of future two-time Academy Award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who later shot Saving Private Ryan, War Of The Worlds, War Horse, and the forthcoming Ready Player One.\u000a\u000aBeing an indie film, Grim Prairie Tales left no discernible financial trail, unlike a larger studio picture, and Coe admits that he was not deeply involved on that side and has not been affiliated with the picture since 1991. \u201cThe video license lasts for 20 years, and as soon as it ended in 2010 I saw DVDs,\u201d he says. Unfortunately, they were bootleg dubs from VHS. It appears that a laserdisc came out around the time of the anthology\u2019s original release, but copies are scarce.\u000a\u000aThe director and producer had a falling out after the film came out, and Coe does not own any of the original film elements. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not the rights holder. The producer did not leave me on good terms.\u201d Wayne says he was contracted to receive three prints of the film and a video master (for personal use only) that he never received. But he does not believe there are any legal complications or copyright snaggles holding up a re-release. It\u2019s likely just about securing a good financial deal.

aVAlan Rickman, who generated plenty of goose-pimples in his all-too-brief career, once confessed his scariest moment occurred when auditioning for Judge Turpin in the Sweeney Todd film: \u201cStephen Sondheim walked into the room and said, \u2018Sing.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s good to report that Jake Gyllenhaal, who just made his Broadway musical debut in Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, was spared this special terror even hardcore career singers know to dread. For that, he can thank Jeanine Tesori.\u000a\u000aThe Tony-winning composer of Fun Home, in her capacity as Artistic Director of Encores! Off-Center (New York City Center\u2019s series of four-day Off-Broadway revivals), hired him twice for his heretofore unknown musical gifts: first, suddenly, as Seymour in Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman\u2019s Little Shop of Horrors and then as Georges Seurat, painting his famed \u201cSunday on La Grande Jatte\u201d in Sunday et cetera.\u000a\u000a\u201cJeanine and I went through the music, and I felt she was\u2014without letting me know\u2014testing me in the process,\u201d recalled Gyllenhaal. \u201cMaybe they were a bit sneaky. They made it seem like I didn\u2019t have to, but I must have been auditioning.\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal\u2019s suspicions are correct: \u201cSteve just said, \u2018Can he sing it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes. Absolutely!\u2019 And that was it,\u201d Tesori relayed. Not so fortunate was Gyllenhaal\u2019s leading lady, Annaleigh Ashford, who plays Seurat\u2019s mistress and muse, Dot.\u000a\u000aShe\u2019s the proven musical-comedy talent (with a Tony nomination for Kinky Boots and a Tony win for You Can\u2019t Take It With You), but she had to sing for Sondheim.\u000a\u000aWhen the offer came, she was eight months pregnant (which, actually, would have worked for Dot) and in L.A. \u201cI had to make a recording for him so that he knew that I could sing the low notes in the opening number because it\u2019s quite low for a lady voice,\u201d remembered Ashford. \u201cThat was a magical moment for me. I was in my underwear, recording it on my computer on GarageBand, and I gave him extra scales to show him how high I went up. Then, I sent that little mp3 off, and here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aTesori suspected a musical career might be lurking in Gyllenhaal when she heard he did musicals in high school. That, plus the fact that they shared the same agent, cinched the deal. \u201cWhen I was putting Little Shop together, I asked our agent if Jake would do it. He said, \u2018He might. Let me ask him.\u2019\u201d The actor was interested enough to have lunch with Tesori and discuss the possibilities. \u201cHe was doing Constellations at the time, and I started pestering him. But it wasn\u2019t until I went backstage and left him a plant that had little legs and hands on it\u2013with ketchup\u2014that he said \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal and Ashford, basking in the extra rehearsal, turn in assured, risk-taking portrayals. \u201cAs intimidating as his music is, it\u2019s also incredibly enveloping,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as you feel it in the audience, you feel it doing it as a performer. You feel safe.\u201d\u000a\u000aLa La Land musicals being all the rage now, the two leads were asked what film musicals they\u2019d like to do. Ashford paused a thoughtful beat and declared \u201cThis!\u201d\u000a\u000aThen, on further reflection, she amended that from Sunday to any given Sondheim: \u201cHis body of work is so special it\u2019s almost indelible in the lexicon of art. We should try to explore his pieces on film. It\u2019s important his work be celebrated on screen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat particular question has never come up before for Gyllenhaal, being so new to musicals. \u201cI\u2019m asked that a lot about roles in general,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe way this thing came together was serendipitous in an unlikely combination of elements\u2014almost like fate impeding and pushing in the way that it needed to be expressed. That\u2019s generally how I look at [roles] at this point. I\u2019ve never been someone who said, \u2018I want to do that,\u2019 though at some point I guess Tevye might be a good idea.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, how close does Seurat come to other characters that Gyllenhaal has played? \u201cThere\u2019s an obsessive quality to him, a focused quality that connects to a lot of characters I relate to and have played. One way or another, they\u2019ve all been leading to George, so I\u2018d probably say, really, all of them\u2014even The Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aSondheim and his director-book writer, James Lapine, drew a soaring celebration of the creative spirit from the two years Seurat spent turning chaos into coherence and disharmony into harmony for his masterpiece. As such, it seems the perfect vehicle to return the Hudson Theater to theatrical life after a half-century of other venues.\u000a\u000aGingerly tending the transfer of a book-in-hand City Center concert to a full-on, affecting Broadway production is Lapine\u2019s niece, Sama\u2013and that\u2019s not the naked nepotism it might seem. In fact, she said, \u201cIt was very cool the way it came about at City Center, really a kind of collaborative discovery between James and Jeanine.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen it became clear that the original director would not be free to repeat the chore\u2014he was busy reviving Falsettos on Broadway the same week Sunday was slated for City Center\u2014Tesori suggested getting a young up-and-coming director to do it, perhaps even a female one, and started feeding Lapine resumes to that effect.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, suddenly, he said, \u2018Oh, wait a minute, I know a fabulous young woman director, and she has already done the show!\u2019 So he called me, and we got together.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer previous Sunday had been a regional production in Columbus, Ohio. She also did a Sondheim concert with the Boston Pops in which she got to stage the painting with only six actors. \u201cIt taught me a lot about the minimalist take on such productions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d appears to be thrilled with not only the show\u2019s return but his niece\u2019s handiwork as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it without his love and support, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aRashly, before the generally rhapsodic reviews came out, the producers voluntarily withdrew the show from Tony Awards consideration so they wouldn\u2019t have to dole out 1,600 comps to voters\u2014a perilous proposition for such a short (ten-week) run.\u000a\u000aThat leaves Gyllenhaal and Ashford clinging to the \u201cIt\u2019s the work, not the reward\u201d maxim for dear life, but both can make it through without that shiny piece of silver.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a line in the show: \u2018the art of making art,\u2019\u201d Ashford pointed out. \u201cWhen I walk in the door every day, I think, \u2018We really are here for \u2018the art of making art.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal, likewise, high-roaded it: \u201cI think the performers on Broadway who have long runs work so hard for a long period of time after all the fanfare and all the excitement has passed. That\u2019s a big part of the win, in my opinion, or the nomination of a Tony. We\u2019re doing a lot of hard work right now, but our run is only ten weeks, and that is just a fact. We all know, too, that, as much as it\u2019s an honor and a history, it\u2019s also a business, and I think that business and these awards are also about getting attention and making sure that people see . . . these extraordinary shows that are on Broadway now. The most important thing for us is to get people here to see the show . . . and to make sure people keep coming back to Broadway, so there\u2019s no reason to usurp any of that. We should all be a community supporting each other.\u201d

aVA 2015 NASA report obtained by Observer (that is soon to be publicly released) reports on the ongoing research by scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., on the steps currently being taken to prevent a supervolcano explosion. While this type of catastrophic event only occurs every 100,000 years, an eruption of one of the 20 known supervolcanoes could pose deadly consequences for life on Earth, potentially inciting widespread famine, drought, and drastic climate change. Given that none of the earth\u2019s supervolcanoes have exploded in the past 12,000 years for humans to have recorded, scientists are left to postulate their own theories about the implications one of these eruptions might have on a global scale.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur knowledge of them comes strictly from the geologic record, and the impressively large deposits these eruptions produce,\u201d the NASA study notes. The best data currently available comes by way of the few large volcanic eruptions that have occurred in the past couple hundred years, and their recorded noticeable worldwide repercussions.\u000a\u000a\u201cAn even larger, supervolcanic eruption would have a more noticeable global effect on climate, agriculture and human infrastructure. People living near the eruption would likely perish from roof collapses after approximately 10 cm of wet ash, which exceeds most critical rooftop loads. Survivors living farther away would need to survive extreme famine or outright starvation for months, several years, or longer,\u201d the study notes.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2012 that the World\u2019s food surplus would last only 74 days. Some scientists have proposed growing mushrooms in the face of the volcanic winter that a supervolcano eruption would cause. Science reported in 2016, \u201ceven better would be raising methane-digesting bacteria on diets of natural gas or converting the cellulose in plant biomass to sugar, a process already used to make biofuel.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NASA scientists noted there are three active supervolcanoes in the United States: Yellowstone in Wyoming, the Long Valley Caldera in California, and the Valles Caldera in New Mexico. They focused on Yellowstone in their study to determine if the possibility of a supervolcano eruption could be mitigated. They hypothesized that by finding ways to decrease the the amount of heat building up inside the magma, supervolcanoes could be engineered so as to pose a much lower threat of erupting.\u000a\u000aIn Yellowstone\u2019s case, around 60 to 70 percent of the heat from its magma caldera leaks to the surface, but if more heat, around 35 percent, could be transferred, this would produce a cooling effect and the supervolcano\u2019s possibility of exploding would be greatly reduced. Yellowstone has erupted three times in the past 2.1 million years, the last of those occurred 640,000 years ago. The NASA scientists used the analogy of a leaky bathtub to explain the magma chambers of Yellowstone. They noted, \u201ca bathtub is filled by a faucet but also has a leak\u2014how long does it take for the bathtub to fill? In this case the magma chamber is the bathtub, and the amount of heat energy in the magma is the \u2018water in the bathtub.\u2019 The faucet represents the rate of heat flow into the magma chamber from below. The leak in the bathtub is the heat flowing from the magma chamber to the surface by some combination of conduction, advection, and hydrothermal convection.\u201d\u000a\u000aA possible theory cited in the NASA study for accomplishing this transference of heat involved drilling deep holes over the magma chamber and pumping cold water to lower its temperature. But even this wouldn\u2019t yield enough cooling power, and could have the unintended consequence of triggering an eruption by the underground drilling that would be needed to apply this solution. Another possible fix would be to increase the water within the supervolcano, but this would be a vast engineering project and require such a huge amount of resources that it would likely never receive the funding required, or clear the necessary hurdles of bureaucracy, for its implementation. The most tangible solution, NASA scientists believe, is to build loops around the perimeter of the magma chamber (so as to not disturb the pressure within it, as drilling would) and pump cool water through these drilled loops. This option would also require a multi-billion dollar investment, but it\u2019s possible it could be tweaked into a geothermal energy source. \u201cThis is a competitive price for electric power\u2014an unexpected bonus since our main purpose is to prevent a supervolcano catastrophe. However, this bonus may be the critical factor in getting decision maker approval for such an approach,\u201d the study added.\u000a\u000aThe NASA scientists concluded in their study that much more research was required into the nature and risks of manipulating supervolcanoes before a solution could be applied. Though implementing such protective measures would be a massive, daunting, and expensive undertaking that wouldn\u2019t yield noticeable results for an extremely long time, the threat posed by supervolcanoes to civilization is too great to be ignored.

aVSince his departure from the White House, the media has described Steve Bannon as a favorite of Donald Trump\u2019s conservative base. The media picking conservative favorites, though, is sort of like when your parents bought you an album for your birthday. It was always conventional top 40 favorites, and it was never the band you really liked.\u000a\u000aThe media understands conservative favorites about as well as parents understood musical tastes back in the day. They think they\u2019re hip to the lingo\u2014but they\u2019re not.\u000a\u000aMost conservatives hadn\u2019t heard of Steve Bannon until he associated himself with Trump, who was by then dominating the news cycle. Before that, Bannon was executive chairman of Breitbart News.\u000a\u000aIt is an occupational conceit of the media to believe that people are influenced by those who purvey news and opinion. There is no way, though, that tens of millions of ordinary Americans were attracted to Trump by reading 700-word essays about trade and immigration on Breitbart.\u000a\u000aNo, people liked Trump because\u2026 how to explain? It\u2019s like the movie One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. Trump is the McMurphy character. People like Trump for hassling Nurse Ratchet at medication time.\u000a\u000aBy 2016, outside the media enclaves of New York and Washington, the federal government had taken on the feel of a medication dispensary at a mental institution. It even had its own Nurse Ratchet-ian figure\u2014Kathleen Sebelius\u2014who was telling everyone in the rigid, humorless way of a career bureaucrat what insurance to buy, what medicines to take, and when to take them.\u000a\u000aThere was only one McMurphy candidate among the contenders for the presidency. Trump\u2019s Twitter audacity was a strength, a demonstration that he would not be deterred by phony outrage. Breitbart may have occasionally helped Trump, but it is a chicken and egg scenario. The disaffected caused Breitbart; Breitbart did not cause the disaffected.\u000a\u000aTrump voters are\u2014although they are never portrayed this way in late night comedy sketches\u2014independent thinkers not beholden to the forms and fashions that are beamed through televisions and computers.\u000a\u000aThey are employed, often under difficult circumstances, in occupations in which they can easily come to believe that the game is fixed against them with onerous regulations and the like.\u000a\u000aThe Trump voter who runs the logo stenciling business near the Pennsylvania Turnpike succeeds with wit and guile that those who gain power and prestige from the consent of a staid establishment are not capable of. He, and every member of his family right down to the sixth grader who helps with inventory on Saturdays, can use Quickbooks.\u000a\u000aIt is mildly ironic, then, that the lemmings who parrot the pieties of the dominant culture cast Trump voters as the ones whose minds are controlled, this week by Steve Bannon. They are the easily deluded ones, even by the standards of science they claim as their own.\u000a\u000aConsider that there is more evidence of God (e.g. the design of the universe) than there is of Russian collusion with Trump to steal the election, which CNN decrees as a tenet of faith. The Russia story is the opiate of the masses. Those who believe it are the babushka wearing old ladies lighting candles and seeking deliverance, in this case from the results of an election.\u000a\u000aDespite their pretensions, the \u201cwe\u2019re smarter than people in Ohio\u201d crowd is not that impressive. There is not a Norman Mailer or an Andy Warhol among the current band of coastal sophisticates. They have been encouraged by every movie and keynote graduation speaker since 1982 to embark upon a hero\u2019s journey to make a difference, as measured by wealth or fame. Failing that\u2014and most do because people are generally untalented\u2014they settle upon politics, where they can achieve significance based merely on association. The most irredeemable of them go one step further and become FBI director. They control culture, academia and media and reward one another with jobs to perpetuate their reign.\u000a\u000aBut because America is a democracy, they do not control the government\u2014except those members of the government who succumb to media flattery or criticism, however fake. They are capable of large-scale fabrication that preserves their self-regard. First it was Russia. Last week, they invented the rise of white supremacy just so they and theirs could pose on Facebook as Selma marchers.\u000a\u000aForgive the rest of America for considering the whole thing insipid and being offended that this self-absorbed mob would cast them as racist only to posture as heroic in contrast.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2014the man, the haircut, the reality show host\u2014punctures these conceits. Steve Bannon may lead a notable conservative web site, but he is no McMurphy.\u000a\u000aAs all things in the Trump era have been and will be, what happens next will be newsworthy. Given the exit interview he provided to the The American Prospect, there is a chance Bannon thinks it was all about him, or at least the nationalist agenda he espouses.\u000a\u000aPeople are not given to that level of abstraction, which is why it has always been impossible to go straight from polemic to policy. Not even Reagan, the triumphalist mythology of the never-Trumpers notwithstanding, presided over anything that pure.\u000a\u000aIt was the Reagan Justice Department\u2019s advocacy in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), that created the Chevron Doctrine, and with it the modern Administrative State, from which Kathleen Sebelius drew her power to annoy everyone.\u000a\u000aThere will certainly be sniping from Breitbart toward Trump in the coming days. That is human nature. But the big guns will be trained on the real enemy: Congress and its 16 percent approval rating, for its failure to get on board.\u000a\u000aIf Breitbart succeeds in shaming scared-of-their-shadow Republicans in Congress into helping to enact Trump\u2019s agenda, then Bannon just may become the conservative favorite the media thinks he is. He can\u2019t do that without Trump, though.\u000a\u000aBannon needs Trump. Trump doesn\u2019t need Bannon and never did.\u000a\u000aThomas J. Farnan is an attorney from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

aVOn August 23, McClatchyDC reported that the Trump administration deleted concerns the National Park Service addressed in regards to a bill backed by the NRA: \u201cThe National Park Service has several big problems with NRA-backed legislation that would restrict the agency from regulating hunting and fishing within park boundaries. But according to a leaked memo obtained by McClatchy, the Trump administration has so far prevented the parks from voicing such concerns.\u201d The bill would prevent the National Park Service from regulating the hunting of bears and wolves on Alaskan Wildlife reserves, from regulating commercial or recreational fishing within the National Parks, and from voicing concerns about development projects outside park borders that would adversely impact the parks themselves.\u000a\u000aThis is the latest development in a long list of deregulation efforts pushed by Trump and his administration, who are ruining \u201cAmerica\u2019s best idea\u201d by opening them to corporate influence, in direct contradiction to the ethos the park system was founded on.\u000a\u000aLast week, under the direction of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the National Park System reversed a 2011 ban on plastic water bottles within National Parks. The decision came at the hand of Trump\u2019s Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former corporate lobbyist who previously represented Deer Park Water. The bottle and beverage industry have lobbied against the ban since it was enacted to mitigate pollution within the parks. Zinke has also expressed interest in allowing corporations to provide park services and has proposed a 13 percent budget cut to the National Parks Service, which would be the most drastic cut it has experienced since World War II. Trump\u2019s budget proposal would increase the maintenance backlog of the National Parks from $11 billion to over $30 billion, diminishing the ability of the National Park Service to protect and preserve the lands and sites within the park system.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, the Trump administration is currently reviewing several national monuments to consider how they can be changed, resized, or rescinded completely to benefit the oil and mining industries. Zinke is delivering his four month review to Trump later this week, and Trump will determine the fate of 27 national monuments across the country. Zinke announced on August 24 he suggested that Trump reduce the size of several national monuments, but he did not provide specifics.\u000a\u000aWhile conservation and outdoor organizations have openly protested and campaigned against the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the National Parks, lobbyists are pushing Republicans and the Trump administration to repeal the Endangered Species Act and the Antiquities Act, the second of which has been used by presidents since Theodore Roosevelt to protect pristine landscapes and ecologically sensitive areas. Special interests have fought against the creation and protection of the National Parks since they were founded, and the Trump administration is reversing gains made by the park system, all to benefit the corporations and industries that intend to exploit the parks.\u000a\u000aSome of Barack Obama\u2019s most beneficial actions during his tenure were those that protected the environment and National Parks, yet these are precisely the same actions Trump and Republicans are uniting against. In doing so, they are tarnishing the legacy of the National Park System, which was created to protect the most important areas in this country \u201cfor the benefit and enjoyment of the people,\u201d as reads a quote from President Theodore Roosevelt that resides on the iconic arch at Yellowstone National Park\u2019s north entrance, the United States\u2019 first National Park.

aVThe August 28th issue of The New Yorker magazine features a lengthy profile of songwriter and musician Annie Clark, better known to fans as St. Vincent. The piece, written by Nick Paumgarten, comes out just ahead of Clark\u2019s forthcoming sixth album. The yet-to-be-titled album drops this fall, and was done in collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff.\u000a\u000aBut between anecdotes in the profile about Clark\u2019s self-induced seclusion (she\u2019s traded her East Village apartment for the Marlton Hotel to write the album without distraction) and theories surrounding the personal inspiration behind her lyrics (\u201cIt\u2019s a composite,\u201d she told Paumgarten, referring to any assumptions that they\u2019re based a single person), the article also includes a show-stopping portrait of the singer by artist Marilyn Minter.\u000a\u000aNew York-based Minter is best known for her photo-realistic paintings examining the body, beauty and sexual desire. Her first major museum retrospective wrapped in May, and was shown at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver and the Brooklyn Museum. For The New Yorker, Minter photographed Clark slightly obscured through a piece of glass, and saturated with rich purple and green hues that compliment the singer\u2019s eyes and give her an otherworldly quality.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not interested in just another pretty face,\u201d Minter tells me by phone, on working with the musician. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not interested in being one.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the way her image\u2019s unique effects were created in the studio, Minter explained, \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been shooting behind steamed or frozen glass. I sort of let the \u2018gods of moisture\u2019 take over. I never know whats going to happen. I look thru [sic] the lens and wait for something interesting.\u201d\u000a\u000aMinter previously used the technique to capture performer Miley Cyrus for a campaign for Planned Parenthood, and her 2016 series exploring natural depictions of female public hair\u2014shown at Salon 94 gallery on the Bowery\u2014follows the same thread. For now, the artist says she has no plans to adapt the portrait of Clark further for the canvas.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnnie is a wonderful talent, I am looking forward to her album,\u201d says Minter, discussing Clark\u2019s music. \u201cBut I must admit I got thrills watching her sing Nirvana\u2019s \u2018Lithium\u2019 on the R&R Hall of Fame show.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead The New Yorker\u2019s full profile on Annie Clark here, and see more of Minter\u2019s work on Salon 94\u2019s website.

aVPeter Rohrman, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and current IT network engineer, is running as the Libertarian Party\u2019s candidate for governor, hoping to bring new ideas to a governor\u2019s race that has been dominated by Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Kim Guadagno.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy whole life I have always been the type of person to read the newspaper, pay attention to what is going on in politics, and get really angry,\u201d Rohrman told Observer. \u201cAbout four or five years ago, I just saw exactly how far government intrudes into our lives and it was just an amazing wake-up call where I just had to start getting involved. I was never really a Republican and I couldn\u2019t be a Democrat but I just couldn\u2019t look myself in the mirror anymore if I didn\u2019t do something.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter he got involved with the Libertarian Party, Rohrman, 47, ran in 2015 and 2016 for Bergen County freeholder. He lost both races, but he said he continues to be encouraged by growth in the party, now the third largest in the state with 7,464 voters registered as Libertarians.\u000a\u000aBut those numbers are a drop in the bucket compared with Democrats (2.1 million), Republicans (1.2 million) and unaffiliated voters (2.3 million), and independent candidates have never done well in New Jersey statewide races in modern times.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven if I don\u2019t win, this campaign will be used to spread the message more and more,\u201d Rohrman said.\u000a\u000aGuadagno, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor under Gov. Chris Christie for the past seven and a half years, has described some of her own political views as libertarian in the past, noting she is pro-choice and not opposed to same-sex marriage.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would call myself a libertarian,\u201d she told the New York Times in a June interview. \u201cStay out of my house; stay out of my home. Don\u2019t tell me what to do with my body and my family. That\u2019s really where I am on it.\u201d\u000a\u000aRohrman rejects that characterization, claiming that Guadagno\u2019s property tax plan is more \u201csocialist\u201d than it is \u201cconservative.\u201d Guadagno claims that if she wins, she will reduce home owner property taxes by up to $3,000 per household by capping the portion of property taxes that go to schools at 5 percent of household income.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe past eight years she could have used her position at lieutenant governor to advocate for freedom, to advocate for lower taxes, and she didn\u2019t,\u201d Rohrman said. \u201cHer cap on property taxes isn\u2019t really a cap. It is a socialist program. These taxes still have to be paid so she is proposing to have the state pay for it. This is stealing from other people to pay your taxes.\u201d\u000a\u000aRohrman calls his own tax plan \u201cfiscal democracy.\u201d It involves cutting a swath of taxes including property, sales, corporate and gas taxes, public access fees, vehicle registration fees, and all government licenses fees. Instead, an individual would be required to pay 10 percent of total income to the government each year, picking and choosing which programs to fund.\u000a\u000aRohrman estimates that such changes would save $13,000 annually for the average household. But it amounts to a radical and somewhat unpredictable restructuring of state government that could mean losing vital public services.\u000a\u000aThe plan would only work if voters approved a constitutional amendment gutting the Legislature\u2019s power to spend money, essentially scrapping the appropriations clause, one of the strongest in the state constitution, and freeing up the state\u2019s $34.6 billion a year in tax revenue for Rohrman\u2019s a-la-carte plebiscite spending arrangement. It would basically end representative government in New Jersey.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy plan would move the power of appropriations away from legislators,\u201d Rohrman said. \u201cUnder my plan, if the people don\u2019t want it, they don\u2019t have to fund it. Legislators can have any program they want as long as they can convince people to fund it. We have competition everywhere, but not in government.\u201d\u000a\u000aAside from his tax plan, Rohrman\u2019s also wants to bring legal, untaxed marijuana to New Jersey, agreeing with Democrats such as Sen. Cory Booker that it would be an effective tool for criminal justice reform. Rohrman also would issue pardons for nonviolent criminals who were arrested for low-level drug offenses. Rohrman also wants to expand school choice and loosen rules for gun ownership in New Jersey.\u000a\u000aRohrman is a lifelong New Jersey resident who has lived in Bergen County for most of his life. At 18, he joined the Marines. He served in the Gulf War and was on the ground for Operation Desert Storm. He has two children: 15-year-old Ben and 13-year old Peter Jr.\u000a\u000aRohrman\u2019s campaign is currently in the final fundraising push, an effort by the candidate and his running mate Karese Laguerre to debate alongside the major party candidates. The libertarian ticket has yet to raise the $430,000 required by law to participate in the debates.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe in large government; I believe in small government,\u201d Rohrman said. \u201cI believe in personal freedoms. I believe in peace and tolerance and free markets. You have been voting Democrat and Republican for 150 years. Voting for a Democrat or Republican again isn\u2019t going to magically change anything.\u201d

aVCell phones get really crappy the longer we own them.\u000a\u000aLast July, I wrote about my Blackberry Priv after five months using Research In Motion\u2019s first Android phone. I still have it. If I was disappointed then, I loathe it now. Blackberry services have completely quit, I can\u2019t edit my contacts any longer, the power button no longer works reliably and of course it\u2019s slow. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve been holding onto it as a feeble anti-materialist stance.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t mind my weirdness. Most Americans like to upgrade, and they throw out 130 million mobiles each year, according to Scientific American, which means that people are switching phones roughly every two years. This contributes to waves of electronic waste that no one has effectively dealt with (no, not even Apple\u2019s dumb robot).\u000a\u000aWhat if that waste stream could be slowed down by reusing these unwanted phones? What if they could be repurposed as components of cloud server farms, loaded into server racks and pumping through the basic computations that allows remote computer to do so much of our work for us today? That\u2019s the proposition presented by two Princeton researchers, Mohammad Shahrad and David Wentzlaff, in a new paper [PDF] presented at HotCloud 2017. They write:\u000a\u000aThe performance of mobile phone processors has been steadily increasing, causing the performance gap between server and mobile processors to narrow with mobile processors sporting superior performance per unit energy. Fueled by the slowing of Moore\u2019s Law, the overall performance of single-chip mobile and server processors have likewise plateaued. These trends and the glut of used and partially broken smartphones which become environmental e-waste motivate creating cloud servers out of decomissioned mobile phones.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s better to reuse than recycle.\u000a\u000aThe authors cite research that 80 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by mobiles are generated during manufacturing. Extending the useful life of these mobile phones lowers the total cost of those emissions to society. It should also allow used smart phones to replace some manufacturing of server processors, for additional greenhouse gas gains.\u000a\u000aThe authors further contend that \u201cdesigned to work under tight energy constraints, mobile devices are more energy-efficient than commodity servers. Therefore their adoption can help further improve the energy efficiency of modern data centers.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re thinking: how could old phones possibly be good enough? Apparently, though, in their heart of hearts, phones don\u2019t lose power with age. It\u2019s just that updated operating systems impose unreasonable expectations. \u201cThe key idea is that after some time, mobile devices lose a significant portion of their value due to physical damage, slowdowns due to OS updates, etc.; whereas their processing power remains constant,\u201d the authors write.\u000a\u000aThe researchers propose networking old cell phones together on server racks, using only their system on chips to run computations. Intriguingly, they suggest that nothing physically needs to be done with the the phone itself. In fact, there could be benefits to leaving it intact. For example, the batteries on board could be used to even out energy usage during periods of peak demand on the grid (a benefit that comes at no extra cost). Further, phones rendered unusable to people because of badly damaged screens would work perfectly fine in a server, as long as the processors still work.\u000a\u000aThe authors then modeled whether such a system could work well enough to make the cost of building it worthwhile. There model suggests it should be fine (maybe even great), but further work needs to be done. For example, they need to test how well old mobiles hold up under constant use in a server system.\u000a\u000aIn fact, in their comparison of a brand new server versus one built out of old Samsung Galaxy Notes, it gets tantalizing for consumers. The price that they modeled for the old Samsung was $160. This is nearly three times what the phone recycling site Gazelle is offering for that model right now, at $60 in good condition (I can\u2019t find anyone offering to buy back my old Priv). The authors probably over-estimated the cost for acquiring old phones, but there\u2019s still hope that a new market for these devices could have knock-on pocketbook benefits for consumers.\u000a\u000aBeyond, you know, contributing to cleaner air, water and preventing the sky from burning us all to a crisp\u2014those would be nice benefits, too.

aVBrandon Stanton came to New York in 2010 with a camera and the goal of photographing 10,000 people. Seven years later, his blog \u201cHumans of New York\u201d has become a social media sensation, spawning a Facebook page with over 18 million likes and an Instagram following of over seven million people.\u000a\u000aAnd now, it\u2019s gonna be a TV show.\u000a\u000aStanton announced yesterday on Facebook that a 12-episode Humans of New York documentary series would premiere on Facebook Watch, the site\u2019s new video hub, next week. A specific date wasn\u2019t provided, though new episodes will be released weekly.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the heart of all these posts are the conversations themselves,\u201d Stanton wrote. \u201cI always do my best to recreate the experience through photos and words. But I always knew that video would provide the closest thing to \u2018actually being there\u2019\u2026 My goal was not to make a television show based on Humans of New York. I wanted the television show to be Humans of New York.\u201d\u000a\u000aLike the blog and social media pages, the half hour show will focus on intimate, candid interviews with strangers on the streets of New York. Stanton told The Hollywood Reporter that he actually began filming video interviews in 2013, with the help of cinematographer Michael Crommett. The pair has talked with more than 1,200 people over 400 days of filming.\u000a\u000aWhile Facebook Watch features short-form series from over 30 content partners, Humans of New York is one of the few shows the social media giant is funding itself. Stanton said the partnership made sense since much of his audience comes from Facebook\u2014because of the site\u2019s global reach, two-thirds of HONY\u2019s fans are actually international.\u000a\u000aHumans of New York will also be executive produced by Julie Goldman, an Oscar nominee who\u2019s bankrolled documentaries like Life, Animated and Weiner.\u000a\u000aAmong the other shows Facebook is putting money into is Last State Standing, a series from the producers of American Ninja Warrior in which contestants from each of the 50 states compete for a $500,000 grand prize.

aVNo one ever really wins a war in a complicated nowhere like Afghanistan. Grim, landlocked terrain and helter skelter demographics make daily life difficult. Add war, and the difficult becomes Hell.\u000a\u000aLogistics and transport problems bog expeditionary armies entering Afghanistan\u2014we\u2019ve known this for at least 2,500 years. Tribal and ethnic hostilities and sectarian disputes among locals always confound outsiders. Alexander the Great would call this old news. Indigenous guerrilla forces may achieve limited military and political victories over foreign invaders, but ethnic and sectarian rivalries, little wars within wars, never quite end. Meanwhile, the people of Afghanistan suffer. The vulnerable in the crossfire die by the hundreds of thousands from starvation, exposure, combat, criminal slaughter and sectarian execution.\u000a\u000aIn 2017, many Americans seem to have forgotten that Afghanistan is where Osama bin Laden, the Soviet Union and the U.S. intersected. In 1979, Moscow saw the chronically weak Carter administration trapped in the Iran hostage crisis. An Afghanistan Soviet Socialist Republic would be a step toward obtaining one of the czars\u2019 strategic goals: a warm water port on the Indian Ocean. After Afghanistan, the Russians would take Pakistan\u2019s Baluchistan (western Pakistan) and Russian-controlled territory would split the Asian continent.\u000a\u000aOutlandish? Perhaps, but many mad dreams in Moscow have led to war.\u000a\u000aU.S. support for the Afghan Mujahideen made Cold War sense. So Washington helped them defeat the Soviet invaders. However, when the Soviets left, America lost interest. In doing so, America failed itself and the people of Afghanistan. But bin Laden didn\u2019t lose interest. The Russian defeat and U.S. abandonment led bin Laden and his terror organization to conclude the world was ripe for his global brand of Islamist revolution. In bin Laden\u2019s view, America is a quitter.\u000a\u000aThe Clinton administration ignored Afghanistan\u2019s post-Cold War battlefield and enjoyed the peace dividend. In 2000, George W. Bush ran on a platform disdaining nation-building and promoting high tech military modernization.\u000a\u000aNo, America didn\u2019t expect to fight a war in the Himalayas. But the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington\u2014when Islamist terrorists informed America they were waging a global war\u2014forced the fight.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a bitter adage. You may not want war, especially in hill country where every warlord valley\u2019s conflict is unique. But sometimes war in a nowhere Hell wants you.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aKorea is America\u2019s longest war\u2014not Afghanistan. Korea\u2019s occasionally bloody stand-off has continued for nearly seven decades, waxing hotter, waning cooler and never concluding. Today it\u2019s once again in danger of escalating to all out combat.\u000a\u000aDo the math. America has stuck it out for 67 years. South Korea has worked hard and prospered immensely; it is now one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries and a stalwart American ally. While Seoul is a happening place, North Korea has starved and shriveled while seeking nuclear weapons. Only some of the light bulbs in Pyongyang work.\u000a\u000aWhen 9/11 occurred, America had been on the ground in South Korea for 51 years. America in for the long haul is a lesson in and of itself, one the myopic bin Laden missed because he was certain his Caliphate had divine sanction.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aA bottom line man like Donald Trump has to ask: What does America have to show for 16 years of war in Afghanistan? South Korea in 1966 had a semi-authoritarian government but one devoted to economic and social development. Seoul was building a military force and would eventually deploy divisions in Vietnam. Sixteen years on Afghanistan\u2019s government is fig leafs, band aids and slush funds. Its security forces are unreliable. The Taliban remain waiting in the hills, both in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Al-Qaeda still has cadres in country. The Islamic State had a deep bunker command center on Afghan territory\u2014until an American MOAB bomb destroyed it in an attack that may prove to be a peek at the Trump administration\u2019s new Afghanistan strategy.\u000a\u000aWhy so little progress? Barack Obama and Pakistan both deserve a lot of blame, as does the Afghanistan government.\u000a\u000aBarack Obama did nothing to solve the problem of Afghanistan\u2019s nowhere. Obama left Afghanistan worse off than he received it. His administration claimed U.S. combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014. Except they didn\u2019t.\u000a\u000aRecall Obama as tweeter-in-chief (hat tip Instapundit and Powerline):\u000a\u000aPresident Obama: "By 2014, the war in Afghanistan will be over." \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 5, 2012\u000a\u000aFACT: President Obama has a plan to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014\u2014Mitt Romney does not. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 22, 2012\u000a\u000aPresident Obama: \u201cWe\u2019re ending the war in Afghanistan because after a decade of war, it\u2019s time to do some nation-building here at home.\u201d \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 23, 2012\u000a\u000aHe spewed a lot of other self-serving falsehoods as he wasted lives, treasure and time. Obama intended to sell himself as a war-ender\u2014no matter the conditions on the ground. He pulled the same con in Iraq. President Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq was not based on the conditions within the country. It was based on his 2012 re-election campaign.\u000a\u000aHow callous. In Spring 2014, the Islamic State invaded Iraq. In 2017, U.S. combat troops are on the ground in Iraq.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aIn Afghanistan, the Trump administration has decided to emphasize \u201csecurity first\u201d instead of nation building. The Trump administration won\u2019t tell the world when it will reinforce and withdraw personnel and where they will go. In other words, it will practice military common sense.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration\u2019s strategy is conditions-based, not time-based like Obama\u2019s flawed policy. Trump\u2019s team will use a \u201cregional approach\u201d to achieve these favorable conditions. Pakistan must end its material and political support for the Taliban and other anti-Afghanistan government organizations. It will no longer be a safe haven for these groups. To the contrary, Pakistan must help police and destroy these groups. In order to do this, Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) bureau will have to fight an internal civil war, but so be it. My guess is Indian, British and U.S. intelligence agencies can supply the names of the ISI officers involved in aiding Islamist extremist organizations.\u000a\u000aThe emerging U.S.-India alliance puts additional pressure on Pakistan. Pakistan is increasingly isolated. China is not a reliable Pakistani ally, nor is Russia. Islamabad knows China and Russia covet Pakistani territory. Both are allies of last resort. While Pakistan is giving Chinese warships access to a seaport, China refuses to give Pakistan a mutual defense arrangement.\u000a\u000aAs for the Afghanistan government: It will not be coddled. Afghanistan\u2019s leaders must make real reforms, show real progress and produce real results. One of those real results must be policing terrorist groups (like Pakistan). To paraphrase the president and vice president, American patience is limited and America is prepared to stop writing checks.\u000a\u000aThere are no guarantees in war. There are no guarantees that the Trump administration\u2019s new strategy will sufficiently secure Afghanistan, curtail outside support for the Taliban, and lead to a negotiated peace that preserves stability and serves U.S. strategic interests\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s better than Obama\u2019s lies and fecklessness.\u000a\u000aAustin Bay is a contributing editor at and adjunct professor at the University of Texas in Austin.

aVFormer NFL quarterback Michael Vick may not be in the league any longer, but he\u2019s not leaving football all together. Vick will reportedly join Fox Sports as an NFL analyst for the upcoming season.\u000a\u000aAccording to USA Today, Vick will join the network as a studio analyst on Fox NFL Kickoff and will also make frequent appearances on Fox Sports 1. The 37-year-old was named to four Pro Bowls in his 14 year career that began when the Atlanta Falcons selected him first overall in the 2001 draft. He brings with him extensive firsthand NFL knowledge from the game\u2019s most important position.\u000a\u000aVick made his retirement official in June after signing a one-day contract with Atlanta so he could retire a Falcon. He last appeared in the league in 2015 with the Pittsburgh Steelers and also spent time with the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Jets. Considered one of the most electric athletes to ever step on the field, Vick rushed for 6,109 yards as a quarterback.\u000a\u000aVick comes into a good situation as Fox Sports has consistently been one of the highest-rated NFL pregame destinations for years compared to competitors such as ESPN, NBC and CBS. Adding a big name like Vick will continue to bring in viewers, and executive producer John Entz is excited about the move.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was obviously an outstanding player, but we feel he has an incredibly bright future as an analyst,\u201d Entz said. \u201cHe has stayed close to the game and has many relationships with today\u2019s current coaches and players. We feel he can bring a truly unique perspective that intrigues and engages our viewers.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the decision doesn\u2019t come without some controversy. Vick spent 21 months in prison for his involvement in a dogfighting ring. Some viewers may be turned off by Vick\u2019s past, though he has been out of prison since 2009.

aVBill Nye is taking aim at Disney in a fraud lawsuit that claims the Mouse House owes him $9.35 million for his popular 1990s TV show, The Wrap reports. Millennials everywhere are likely weeping.\u000a\u000aNye\u2019s legal camp filed the lawsuit with the Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday, which accuses the Walt Disney Company of fraud and breach of contract. Specifically, they claim that Disney squirreled away at least $28 million in \u201cill-gotten profits\u201d from his series, Bill Nye the Science Guy. Also named in the suit are ABC, Buena Vista and Touchstone, according to The Wrap.\u000a\u000aNye, who was owed 16.5 percent of the show\u2019s profits, CNN reported, originally became suspicious when Buena Vista demanded a big chunk of his 2007 earnings back due to what they claim was an \u201caccounting error.\u201d This prompted him to try and obtain specific records from their bookkeeping. However, he was reportedly met with opposition and eventually was forced to hire an external auditor.\u000a\u000aAccording to the suit, the TV host \u201cbelieves and thereon alleges that as a direct and proximate result of the Defendants\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff has suffered damages in the amount of not less than [$9.35 million], the final amount to be proven at trial.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt continues: \u201cPlaintiff is further informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Defendants, by breaching their fiduciary duties, enriched themselves, at the expense of the Plaintiff and the BNSG Owners, obtaining ill-gotten profits of not less than [$28.051 million].\u201d\u000a\u000aBill Nye the Science Guy originally aired from 1993 to 1998.

It\u2019s a wave we noted last year. But over the last 12 months, the blurred lines have continued transforming the business in ways that are surprising even industry veterans. \u201cClients aren\u2019t choosing specializations anymore,\u201d said Salzman, whose company now brings in just a third of revenue from conventional media relations. \u201cThey\u2019re choosing people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNelson Fernandez, North American chairman of APCO Worldwide and its managing director in New York, agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a convergence between PR, advertising and digital. It\u2019s channel-agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who understands how to get inside people\u2019s heads. We\u2019re the ones who can read trends in how people are connecting, behaving and communicating. And if we keep doing that, I think we\u2019ll continue to be a very important\u2014perhaps the most important\u2014part of the marketing mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgencies are even moving away from describing themselves as PR firms. \u201cWe are content providers and distributors. Media relations no longer defines what we do,\u201d said Florence Quinn, founder of Quinn, the travel and lifestyle powerhouse. \u201cWe create strong ideas that resonate with people and the media. This is incredibly exciting because there are a gajillion ways to produce content and even more ways to distribute it. The line between earned and paid media has been crossed forever; there is no going back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt firms like Sunshine Sachs, whose clients range from A-list celebs (Lin-Manuel Miranda to blue-chip nonprofits (Human Rights Campaign) to corporations like Facebook, the transformation\u2019s been even more radical. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 35 people who don\u2019t do traditional communications,\u201d said Shawn Sachs, the firm\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant for a firm with about 160 people. We hired our second art director this year. If you\u2019d said that 10 years ago, people would have thought you were crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the broadest sense, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re a communications company. But we\u2019re also an advertising company, a marketing company, a digital company, an events company, an idea company. We\u2019re a lot of things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe upheaval in media has also transformed what clients need, said Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of entertainment and marketing giant PMK*BNC\u2014and agencies like hers have benefited.\u000a\u000a\u201cSharing and providing content\u2014that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Berger said. \u201cOur ability is to really craft a narrative for a specific client, pursue media for that client, work with influencers and generate partnerships, whether they\u2019re brand related or fan-related. Fans are partners too. Our job is to make sure fans download the book, buy the record or use a provider we\u2019re working with.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t give up on traditional PR just yet, said Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick, where more than two-thirds of growth is coming from digital, social and content-marketing arm Mediaco. \u201cWe call ourselves an engagement firm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, it\u2019s a mistake to decide you\u2019re no longer in the public relations business. If you think about changes in the media world, and the impact earned media still has, PR continues to be absolutely critical. Sure, we\u2019ve evolved as a firm. But we\u2019re proud of our heritage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd while creative destruction hasn\u2019t been great for media, it\u2019s keeping PR mavens buoyantly optimistic (and well compensated\u2014according to The Holmes Report, the global PR industry grossed $14.2 billion in 2015).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in the message business,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cAnd our business is as exciting and interesting as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: New York\u2019s Top Specialty PR Agencies\u000a\u000aA word about the PR Power 50 list:\u000a\u000aRather than rely on revenue or size as criteria for our rankings, the Observer considers subjective factors. What kind of year did a firm have? Did it hire superstars? Has it won covetable clients? Does it feel like the agency\u2019s got momentum and juice? Did it avoid serious screw-ups\u2014or at least keep its screw-ups out of view? And, of course, did its people return our calls and emails?\u000a\u000aEvery one of the 50 firms we\u2019ve chosen pushed those buttons, but our agency of the year for 2016 boasted an especially stellar performance. We\u2019re eager to hear what you think about where the industry\u2019s been this year\u2014and where it\u2019s going in 2017 and beyond.

aV\u201cCome for a day, stay for a week,\u201d reads the tourism website of Cold Spring, New York. That\u2019s a fine slogan, but it did not, alas, apply to our intrepid contestants on Bravo\u2019s Work of Art: The Next Great Artist this week, who were destined to hop a train from Grand Central for a brief, nervous jaunt up and down the town\u2019s Main Street, during which time they marveled at how picturesque (read: creepy) everything was and how weird the locals were, before fleeing back to the (much less weird and creepy) world of reality television.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe name makes it sound like it has something to do with spa treatments,\u201d contestant Young Sun Han murmured rapturously, as if he\u2019d just discovered a Shangri-La for TV\u2019s gay stereotypes. (Look, there\u2019s village councilman Sean Hayes!)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe further we get away from the city the more it looks like home to me,\u201d Dusty meanwhile drawled sweetly. We\u2019ve ridden Metro North\u2019s Hudson Line, and the back lots of New England mini malls do not particularly resemble Arkansas\u2019s amber waves of grain, in our humble opinion.\u000a\u000a\u201cWelcome to the quaint town of Cold Spring, New York,\u201d says show hostess/rich person China Chow, looking like a Strangers on a Train murderess in a big trench coat. Two people were going to get the boot, we learned. But, \u201cIf you survive this challenge you will be competing for the grand prize,\u201d Ms. Chow threatened. Survive this challenge? Is that what they\u2019ve been doing with the eliminated contestants? The challenge, if you\u2019re interested, was to take $200 and find a way to create a portrait of a verifiable, salt of the Thornton Wilder-ian earth Cold Spring resident.\u000a\u000aKYMIA NAWABI\u000a\u000a\u201cI have laryngitis today,\u201d rasps the first quaint resident that Ms. Nawabi hassled. But fear not, for Bob and Barbara, owners of some kind of haunted tchochke shop, rise to the occasion, proving themselves to be part charming Stars Hollow, part \u201call work and no play.\u201d In Ms. Nawabi\u2019s terms, they\u2019re a solid blend of \u201cweirdness and also sweetness.\u201d The couple, we learn, has \u201calways loved dolls.\u201d So Ms. Nawabi makes a kind of dark, demonic Norman Rockwell painting of the duo, portraying them as ice skaters in front of scary antique miscellany\u2014they skated on their first date. \u201cThe only non-conventional thing is that they\u2019re going to have several arms,\u201d artist mentor/auctioneer Simon de Pury frets of Ms. Nawabi\u2019s painting. Which is funny, because when he gesticulates, he looks like a stop-motion photograph of a pitcher. \u201cGet some weirdness in it,\u201d he cautions.\u000a\u000aYOUNG SUN HAN\u000a\u000aMr. Han makes a beeline to the nearest bed and breakfast, to inquire about spa treatments and also \u201ctown secrets,\u201d because he\u2019s clearly been watching The Witches of Eastwick, and believes the two go hand in hand. While he gets a guided tour of the inn\u2019s nine rooms, variously furnished with Jacuzzis and wood-burning fireplaces he is left scrambling, at the very last moment, for a subject. Luckily, he pinpoints the next great artist of Cold Spring at the Terence Donovan gallery\u2014namely, jolly Mr. Donovan himself, whom Mr. Han pays $200 for a 20-minute portrait. And guess what? Terence\u2019s portrait is really nice\u2014it\u2019s got a little Karen Kilimnik, or even Elizabeth Peyton in its saucy yet tender broad-stroked depiction of its young male subject. (\u201cYou have kind of Justin Bieber-ish hair,\u201d Terence says, which is totally something we can imagine Ms. Peyton saying to any of her sweetly puckish subjects.) In the gallery, Mr. Han leans Terence\u2019s painting against a wall, behind wooden planks plastered with extreme-close-up photographs of Terence that he took of the artist while he worked.\u000a\u000aLOLA THOMPSON\u000a\u000aHaving been soundly rejected by the town motorcycle guy, Ms. Thompson seeks out the men who are next on the list of people most likely to succumb to her witchy ways and nymphette wiles. Dennis and Tommy, rare-coin-collecting gentlemen, succumb to her flirtation, handing over a 1928 five-dollar bill to her. Ms. Thompson then prepares a multi-faceted, mostly non-figurative portrait/tribute to the two collectors, featuring a letter she wrote to them, which begins, \u201cDear Dennis and Tommy, You are the secret historians of Cold Spring\u201d (or maybe not so secret\u2026). There\u2019s also some tinfoil, and a pyramid of blown-up images of historic bills, and some other things on a shelf.\u000a\u000aDUSTY MITCHELL\u000a\u000aMr. Mitchell shyly settles on a little girl as his subject. She likes candy\u2014\u201call kinds!\u201d\u2014 and reminds the contestant of his daughter Cora, whom he abandoned in her infancy to go off to (an art-reality-TV) battle, and who, when this episode was filmed, had just turned one the previous day. Mr. Mitchell decides to make a mosaic of his young subject\u2019s face from M&Ms. Mr. de Pury\u2014who, in his most hilarious joke of season two, says he wants to \u201ccome to AR-Kansas\u201d\u2014briefly convinces Mr. Mitchell to work on a portrait made from folded-paper fortune-tellers, before the contestant runs out of time and returns to his candy idea. By that point, however, it\u2019s too late for the glue to dry, so M&Ms keep falling off it. Mr. Mitchell hopes that everyone will find this decomposition \u201cinteresting.\u201d\u000a\u000aSARA JIMENEZ\u000a\u000aBecause she always seems wryly uninterested in everything around her, Ms. Jimenez drives away her first potential subject, before finding friends among the local firemen. One older firefighter, Jackie, is of particular interest to Ms. Jimenez. He\u2019s battled blazes for 58 years, thereby inspiring a quite charming backlit portrait made from aluminum (which weirdly kind of resembles Mao) paired with an uninspiring dangly sculpture of aluminum and charcoal nameplates, one for every year Jackie served.\u000a\u000aTHE CRITIQUE\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s guest judge is pop-star portraitist Richard Phillips, who, for the record, is much taller than critic/judge Jerry Saltz and Ms. Chow, even in her crazy-tall heels, but maybe not taller than gallerist/judge Bill Powers\u2019 hair. The local portrait subjects show up for the gallery showing, and luckily enough, none of them are perceptibly offended by their variously unflattering, candy-coated, epistolary and so forth depictions.\u000a\u000aWINNER\u000a\u000aKymia Nawabi wins the first slot on the final episode for her cartoonish portrait because, as Ms. Chow says of Bob and Barbara, \u201cI met them and they\u2019re cartoons!\u201d That\u2019s not very nice, we think, and neither is Mr. Phillips\u2019 comment on the piece: \u201cAt first I was throwing up inside.\u201d But apparently none of that matters when you\u2019re in the final trio of possible next great artists.\u000a\u000aALSO HEADED TO THE FINALE\u000a\u000aYoung Sun Han, who we think should probably be facing an intellectual-property/copyright suit from Terence right about now, slinks by, even though the judges point out that he should have just shown Terence\u2019s painting. (Weird how the next great artist is not even a contestant on this show\u2026 Team Terence!) Sara Jimenez, meanwhile, also will compete in the final episode, mostly because Mr. Saltz is so proud that his little charge worked outside of her \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d Personally, we\u2019re freaked out that she referred to her portrait of Jackie (who\u2019s alive and thriving) as a \u201cmemorial.\u201d\u000a\u000aGOING HOME\u000a\u000aDusty Mitchell is at last taking that long covered-wagon ride back to Arkansas, mostly because too many of his artworks were literally paint-by-numbers pieces. And Lola Thompson will hop Al Pacino\u2019s jet back to Los Angeles because Ms. Chow doesn\u2019t understand why the currency pyramid counts as a portrait (odd, since Ms. Chow resembles money). Also, it\u2019s too scattered in its abstraction for the rest of the judges. And there is much crying.

aVShe\u2019s been an actress, a beauty pageant contestant, a trial lawyer, and now a Fox News host and radio personality. But no matter her professional position, it all comes down to one thing for Eboni K. Williams.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a direct correlation between what you look like and your ability to sell your message,\u201d she told the Observer.\u000a\u000aWilliams, who co-hosts both The Fox News Specialists and the WABC radio show Curtis and Eboni, does a deep dive into this topic in her book Pretty Powerful: Appearance, Substance and Success, which will be released September 12.\u000a\u000aRaised by a single mom, Williams started acting in commercials at the age of six. She also entered beauty pageants to win scholarship money. While at these events, she noticed that the people with the most polished appearances usually ended up winning. So even though they couldn\u2019t afford designer clothes, Williams and her mom made sure to look professional at every casting call.\u000a\u000aWilliams then honed these abilities in the courtroom\u2014after graduating from Loyola University law school at 23, Williams practiced law in North Carolina for several years. Fellow attorneys referred to her as the \u201cBarbie lawyer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI realized it wasn\u2019t just okay, but to the advantage of my client, to be intentional about my physical presentation,\u201d Williams said. She also focused on her mannerisms and vocal intonation.\u000a\u000aWhen Williams entered broadcasting, she realized these qualities mattered even more. She started out as a talk radio host and CBS News correspondent in Los Angeles in 2014. In 2015, she moved to New York to become a Fox News contributor. She became a full-fledged host at the network this year, when she also started the radio gig.\u000a\u000aWilliams said she uses \u201cpretty power\u201d in both of her jobs, especially at Fox. The type of show that she\u2019s on, the time of day, and the topics being discussed all factor into her day-to-day decision making.\u000a\u000a\u201cA morning show has a lighter tone, so I used softer colors and cuts of dresses and lighter makeup,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cOn a primetime show you sometimes lean into the drama with a heavier look and a more dramatic color. But you can also counter topics like terrorism and gun violence with a lighter color like white or ivory, because the rhetoric is gonna be strong.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt Fox News, especially in recent years, what\u2019s happened off the air has often got more publicity than what\u2019s on it: Various Fox personalities, including former host Bill O\u2019Reilly and late CEO Roger Ailes, have been in the spotlight because of alleged sexual harassment. Williams tackles these issues head on in her book, devoting an entire chapter to the topic.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would be blind, deaf and dumb to act like there\u2019s no issue at Fox,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWilliams writes that her threshold for sexual harassment is \u201cif I ever feel I must choose between my dignity or integrity and my job.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not feel harassed if someone in the workplace says I have nice legs, or that my dress fits well or that my hairstyle is perfect for my face,\u201d she writes. \u201cI work in television, so those comments all have tangible value in what I\u2019m offering.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilliams considers O\u2019Reilly a mentor who gave her constructive criticism. She never had an issue with him and actually includes him in her book\u2019s acknowledgments. She also says, however, that she would \u201cnever presume to speak for any other woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Williams does not consider her two private meetings with Ailes to be sexual harassment, she describes them in full in her book so readers can decide.\u000a\u000aOn October 1, 2015, a month after Williams started at Fox, she was summoned to Ailes\u2019 office. He told her, \u201cYou look like a lot of work, Eboni. I mean that in a good way. Most of us men are not trying to work that hard. We like to play, and we can be loyal, and we\u2019re good for protecting you, but that\u2019s about it. We\u2019re not good for a lot of work.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn February 7, 2016, before she co-hosted the Fox show Outnumbered, Ailes said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be great on Outnumbered because you have great legs\u2026 When one bitch sees another with a short skirt, she\u2019s gonna make damn sure that the other bitch\u2019s skirt is shorter than hers.\u201d Williams also writes that Ailes advised her to get a married boyfriend because \u201cthey only take up a few days a week, and they will supplement my income.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Williams writes the second encounter did creep her out a little, she also concludes that Ailes \u201cwasn\u2019t telling me anything particularly remarkable\u2026 This might be his way of trying to connect and build a \u2018father figure\u2019 relationship with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Williams wondered aloud why she hadn\u2019t had more issues at Fox, an unnamed male colleague told her, \u201cYou come off as someone who would sue the shit out of them. They are not fucking with you. They attack women they think are weak because they\u2019ve likely gotten away with it in the past.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilliams also uses \u201cpretty power\u201d on her radio show (co-hosted by Curtis Sliwa), albeit in a less dramatic way. She said she lobbied for the job to prove that looks weren\u2019t everything.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wanted to have three hours with no aesthetic component and a more intimate format to prove how important the substance is,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not important just to be pretty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s still a visual element, however. Williams said that since \u201cthe aesthetics of excellence on broadcast television can be exhausting,\u201d she \u201cslummed it\u201d in the first week of the radio show by wearing jeans and T-shirts.\u000a\u000a\u201cI got a couple side eyes,\u201d Williams said. \u201cPeople thought I wasn\u2019t respecting the work environment.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithin a week, Williams started wearing the same dress she sports on Specialists to the radio studio.\u000a\u000aPretty power also helps during more serious situations. Williams found that out firsthand last week when she received backlash over a Fox News segment about President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the Charlottesville attack.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. President, your initial remarks were cowardly and dangerous,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and to equivocate.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany Fox News viewers trolled Williams over this, saying she should \u201cmeet her maker\u201d and \u201cnot be allowed to walk the streets of New York.\u201d And indeed, she is now escorted to and from the building when she\u2019s at work.\u000a\u000aBut Williams said the same tenacity that has helped her get through every other life experience helped her overcome her haters on social media.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have to keep going,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a million nos, but you only need one yes. Hardly anybody agreed with my opinion of the president, but many supported my right to speak my truth.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile she has certainly had an eventful life, Williams also recognizes that she doesn\u2019t know everything. As such, her book includes interviews in which women like Marcia Clark, Monica Crowley and Meghan McCain detail how they use pretty power.\u000a\u000a\u201cMarcia Clark is the first woman outside of a TV character I ever saw practicing law,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMy personal narrative is important, but I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today with the contributions of other women.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilliams admits that pretty power isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether you\u2019re interviewing for Goldman Sachs or McDonald\u2019s, people are already judging what you look like, your values and your work ethic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be above this. It shouldn\u2019t matter. But until it doesn\u2019t matter, I wrote this book as a tool for women so that we control the narrative instead of letting it be controlled for us.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, according to Williams a woman\u2019s agency is absolutely essential to pretty power, no matter what her job is.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo dream is too small,\u201d she said. \u201cThis stuff is applicable in every space, for any woman who wants to make a statement about what she values and express that statement to the world. When you marry those two elements, you\u2019re absolutely unstoppable.\u201d
