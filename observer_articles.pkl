V\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChristie\u2019s auction house will be offering over 400 works from the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s photography collections in a series of sales, both online and live, beginning in October through April 2018, according to an announcement from the house.\u000a\u000aThe sales are the result of a \u201clarger collections review,\u201d according to Darius Himes, international head of photographs at Christie\u2019s. \u201cMoMA continually reviews and refines their collection,\u201d he explained by phone.\u000a\u000aMany of the works that will be on offer are duplicates in MoMA\u2019s holdings, he confirmed, and all proceeds from the works\u2019 sales will go back to the museum to fund future acquisitions. The museum was not immediately available to comment.\u000a\u000aWorks headed to sale include pictures taken by some of the biggest names in the medium\u2019s history, such as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, May Ray and Henri Cartier-Bresson, among others. The first four works\u2014one-of-a-kind photograms or \u201cRayographs\u201d by the surrealist Ray\u2014will be offered in the house\u2019s October 10 Photographs Day sale, including two unique works that are not duplicates, says Himes. Those works, \u201cRayographs\u201d from 1928 (est. $150,000-$250,000) and 1923 (est. $200,000-$300,00) respectively, boast significant provenance, Himes tells me: one was donated to the museum by a close friend of Ray\u2019s, named Tristan Tzara, and the other by a collector named James Thrall Soby. The two pieces lead the October 10 sale with the highest estimates.\u000a\u000aAfter the October live sales, the remaining works will be divided up between a series of thematic online sales, which \u201cmimic the history of MoMA\u2019s photo exhibitions themselves,\u201d says Himes. Themes announced so far are \u201cPictorialism into Modernism\u201d and \u201cWomen in Photography,\u201d and there will be four single artist sales focused on photographers whose histories and works are intertwined with that of the institution. One such artist is Walker Evans, the first photographer to have a solo show with MoMA.\u000a\u000aOn why MoMA and Christie\u2019s have chosen to offer the majority of the works for sale online, Himes says: \u201cIt was definitely a conversation with museum\u2014a real collaboration. Christie\u2019s is a market leader in terms of our online platform, the number of online sales and success we\u2019ve had across the company is immense and we\u2019re very proud of that. From a company standpoint, the largest number of new clients who come to Christie\u2019s come through online.\u201d\u000a\u000aHighlights from the sales will go on view in a touring exhibition through the fall, beginning in Los Angeles and San Francisco in September and then heading to New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center in October, where the MoMA works will be shown alongside pieces from Christie\u2019s other live sales.

aVDuring the Clinton administration, Secretary of State Madeline Albright anointed the United States \u201cthe indispensable nation.\u201d Perhaps Secretary Albright never heard of or chose to disregard French President Charles de Gaulle\u2019s observation about \u201cindispensable\u201d people. \u201cGraveyards,\u201d he said, \u201care full of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat phrase along with \u201cleader of the free world\u201d should be banished from the political and strategic lexicon. Clearly, during World Wars I and II and the Cold War, the United States was indeed the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d and the \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d But those eras are long gone. Unfortunately, the last three presidents failed to recognize this reality. And Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will likely follow the same path.\u000a\u000aWhat happened? The 20th century could be seen as a bipolar or binary geostrategic period. In World War I, it was the Allies versus the Central Powers; in World War II, it was the Allies versus the Axis; and in the Cold War, it was East versus West. This binary condition no longer exists.\u000a\u000aGlobalization, propelled by the information revolution, has induced tectonic change on the international system. The primacy of states\u2014the foundation of international global politics since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia\u2014has been overtaken by the greater empowerment of individuals, non-state actors and international organizations. The influence of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) exemplify this change.\u000a\u000aWhile the United States remains the largest economic and military power in the world, its relative advantages have eroded. For example, IS and al Qaeda, which lack an organized army and navy, are able to challenge and bypass these American advantages. In Syria, Russia has shown that a relatively modest military investment can change the political equation\u2014which stands in stark contrast to the fact that hundreds of thousands of Americans (and other forces) could not do so in Vietnam and more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.\u000a\u000aFurther, the structure of the international system remains a byproduct of World War II and the Cold War, somewhat augmented but never replaced with a framework that suits the 21st century. The UN, World Bank, IMF, GATT/WTO, NATO, G-20 and other international agencies are creatures of the past, designed in large measure for a binary world. Unfortunately, very little political and intellectual capital has been effectively spent on creating a more appropriate framework.\u000a\u000aIn these circumstances, claims of \u201cindispensability\u201d and \u201cleader of the free world\u201d are far less applicable. China and Russia seem happy to develop spheres of influence regardless of the United States, aided in one case by the Trump administration\u2019s foolish decision to leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). And America\u2019s rejection of the Paris Climate Accord likewise has lessened American indispensability.\u000a\u000aThe term free world is also a misnomer. The United States turned a blind eye toward undemocratic and autocratic regimes if those states signed on to oppose the Soviet Union and communism. NATO allies Portugal and Turkey once had repressive regimes. It took decades for South Korea to become fully democratic. And friends on both sides of the Persian/Arabian Gulf from Tehran to Riyadh have scarcely reflected values of the free world. Yet that made little difference.\u000a\u000aNone of this may matter. After all, being the \u201cindispensable power\u201d and \u201cleader of the free world\u201d reflect aspirations and not necessarily reality. Instead, the United States should be pursuing policies based on a judicious understanding of its interests and the need for international cooperation in achieving peace, prosperity and security through partnerships.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has recognized this new reality but in a most clumsy way. For example, the State Department\u2019s rejection of actively pursuing the expansion of democracy as a vital interest reflects the gross failures of that aim in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. And America\u2019s retraction from a larger international role likewise clouds this recognition of diminished influence and leadership.\u000a\u000aBut the largest failure so far is the inability to create a 21st century security framework. Here the Trump administration shares much blame in common with Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Unless or until the United States acts on the realities of the 21st century, obsolete ideas such as \u201cindispensability\u201d and \u201cleader of the free world\u201d will remain slogans rather than effective, workable strategic concepts.\u000a\u000aDr. Harlan Ullman has served on the Senior Advisory Group for Supreme Allied Commander Europe (2004-2016) and is currently senior adviser at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Atlantic Council and Business Executives for National Security, chairman of two private companies and principal author of the doctrine of shock and awe. A former naval person, he commanded a destroyer in the Persian Gulf and led over 150 missions and operations in Vietnam as a Swift Boat skipper.

aV\u201cI have to tell you my new favorite joke,\u201d Uzo Aduba says. \u201cI literally died laughing at it for half a day. You ready? Why did the chicken cross the road?\u201d\u000a\u000aI mumble something that probably sounds like, \u201cTo get to the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo get to the idiot\u2019s house,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cKnock knock.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chicken.\u201d And with that, Aduba descends into laughter. She insists the joke works better in print, but I\u2019ll contest it works pretty well when it\u2019s delivered by a two-time Emmy winner.\u000a\u000aAduba catapulted into mainstream recognition for her tender portrayal of Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren on Netflix\u2019s hit original series, Orange Is the New Black. In 2014, she won her first Emmy in 2014 for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. A year later, she won a second time\u2014best supporting actress in a drama\u2014making her the only actress to win awards in two different categories for the same role.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting to me because I don\u2019t know if I believe we were ever one thing exclusively,\u201d Aduba says, about the Netflix show\u2019s category jumping. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the word is that needs to be created to call it, since we\u2019re so hell-bent as a society to find a category. We\u2019re very invested in placing things in certain boxes, for our own outside comfort, so we can say, \u2018I understand that you are this religion, that you are this gender, that you are this sexual orientation, that you are this sort of director, that this is this sort of show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aFrom its first season, Orange Is the New Black was a show that defied television convention. For one, it was a show that focused almost exclusively on women\u2019s stories, showcasing narratives about power and fear in a world in which male attention was an almost useless currency. It\u2019s also one of the most diverse shows on television\u2014one of the first to showcase a transgender actress portraying a transgender woman, and, as Aduba brings up, one of the only shows that depicts a variety of racial experiences across a number of different races.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs many shows are there are on television that are diverse, now, we still don\u2019t see a lot of television where we see a swath of different characters on a single show,\u201d Aduba says. There\u2019s Orange Is the New Black, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Master of None, Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, \u201cand not many more. We still haven\u2019t rounded that corner. It\u2019s not just enough to have different faces speaking for different groups but different faces all within the same group, speaking to all people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo character in Orange Is the New Black is the \u201ctoken\u201d minority: a character who pops up to offer an opinion on behalf of his or her entire race, whose main purpose in the narrative is offering guidance to the white protagonist and offering comfort to the viewers at home that they aren\u2019t racist.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are people who think this isn\u2019t for them because they\u2019re not a woman, or because they\u2019ve never been to prison, or they see people of color and think it\u2019s not for them. On the side of gender, people are realizing gender has nothing to do with it. You tell an honest story, an honest story lives inside of all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat love of storytelling was what brought Aduba from her path of becoming a classical opera singer to becoming an actress.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn high school, I knew I liked to sing, and my voice happened to sing in a classical fashion, so that seemed like the most sensible thing to do next. But when I went to school, I realized what I loved about singing was the storytelling aspect. Boston College has a classical program, so in the morning I\u2019d be rolling on the floor for movement, and we had to take acting and Shakespeare for the theatrical component, and then the afternoon we did the musical component\u2014musical theory, music history, and I was like, I think I like the rolling on the floor part more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you go into college, you\u2019re in this period in your life where you have so much certainty and uncertainty at the same time. You\u2019re so sure of some things, like, who you think you are and the person you want to be, and then going to school can either cement that for you and confirm, or, for a lot of people, I think it winds up breaking you wide open and making you realize your true identity and that\u2019s what happened with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as she shifted her career goals, Aduba\u2019s classical singing training formed the foundation of what would become her disciplined approach to the craft of acting. \u201cOpera is not something you just get up and do. It takes a discipline, a study, a vocal dexterity that is achieved through the exercise of the voice, and I think that\u2019s applicable to acting. I think how I approach my acting is not just to wake up and do it, although there are some things that can be found in just waking up and doing things, but if I\u2019m working on material, to really study it, and really get inside the head and the psychology of that individual and the world in which he or she inhabits. I had this amazing teacher in college who said, \u2018Anyone can sing pretty, but what are you trying to say?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so what has Aduba been trying to say with the character of Suzanne, who entered the series as comic relief, Piper\u2019s unrequited lover and who, over the course of four seasons, has become one of television\u2019s most heartbreakingly tragic figures, manipulated by those around her and desperate to be seen?\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody deserves love,\u201d Aduba says without hesitation.\u000a\u000aSuzanne Warren is just one of the many characters Orange Is the New Black has developed and enriched over the span of its four seasons. It\u2019s not character growth so much as character deepening, like seeing a two-dimensional shape and then walking around and realizing it was a three-dimensional sculpture all along. Through flashbacks, Orange Is the New Black peels back the khaki uniform and allows us to see prisoners\u2014so often dismissed in red-wine swirling living room political discussions as a monolith\u2014as individuals, each sheltering their own stories.\u000a\u000aAlthough its category at the Emmys has transferred from comedy to drama, that seems something of an arbitrary judgment call and not a shift in the show itself. The first season did have sad-sack Larry, Piper\u2019s infuriating milquetoast liberal stereotype of a fiancé, but it still looked unflinchingly at drug abuse, the struggles of being transgender, the cruel caprices of the corrections officers and the day-to-day Kafkaesque nightmare that is American incarceration.\u000a\u000aThe later seasons didn\u2019t have Larry (thank god), but it focused on the same issues, still unflinching, even as they brought us to their heightened, tragic breaking point.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the first season, Season 4, where I have not watched the end,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cWhen the season came out, that experience was still very emotionally alive for me and I didn\u2019t want to have that experience right then again, because I remember, very clearly, second for second, what each of those last three episodes felt like\u2014and that feeling was so visceral, still, a year and however long away from it, and I was like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to watch that. I still haven\u2019t watched it. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be ready. Or if I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most difficult aspect of watching Orange Is the New Black might be the realization that it could be any one of us behind bars, without rights and seemingly without oversight, even if you think you\u2019re the type of person who would never, ever go to prison. While that lesson might have been most obvious right away with Piper, the privileged upper-middle-class blonde who got caught up 10 years ago with a drug-smuggling lover, it\u2019s true of almost every single character in the series.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood people can make mistakes,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cSetting it a min security prison, you realize with most of these characters, how they got there was a minor infection\u2014slipped on a banana peel and did something that they happened to get caught for it and you didn\u2019t. And I think that does a great way of humanizing these characters because they\u2019re not so far out of reach for most people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Aduba, she\u2019s grateful for the chance to be a part of it, to get to tell a good, honest story. \u201cThis is a gift, to get to do what I want to do. I can still remember waiting in lines, whether it was for an audition before I was union, and having to wait outside the union line, waiting for all of the union people to audition and then they would let the union people in, to stuffing envelopes, to stuffing envelopes with headshots and writing letters with my resume and dropping them off all over this city.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd now, this city is where Aduba is putting down roots. As she came to the interview, she was just finalizing buying a house to live in with her dog, Mr. Fenway Bark. \u201cI\u2019m just really happy,\u201d Aduba says. \u201cI\u2019m like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into The Woods lyric, \u2018Excited and scared.\u2019 That\u2019s what I am.\u201d

aVChristopher Meloni would like to say he\u2019s sorry. Not to me, per se, sitting across from him in an airy loft above NoHo\u2019s cobblestoned Bond Street, but to his 233,000 Twitter followers, mostly. Maybe a little bit to 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Snatched, in which the actor appears briefly but memorably. Possibly, in a more roundabout, elliptical sort of way, he\u2019s even saying sorry to Snatched co-stars Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn. \u201cI find it very difficult to stay on point with all the promotion that I should be doing,\u201d Meloni says. \u201cI want to sit here right now and say I do apologize for being distracted at times with the magnitude of the horror that is this administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the Trump Administration, by the way, as in comma Donald. As in current President of the United States / former host of The Apprentice. As in the man who fired FBI Director James Comey just 24 hours after Meloni and I met to discuss a funny little comedy in which he plays a wannabe Indiana Jones-type named Roger. But if you want your \u201ccelebrities, they\u2019re just like us!\u201d moment, understand that Chris Meloni is having that relatable issue focusing on his work, on his art, on the comedy of it all when he feels that every refresh of the Twitter page brings Mad Max: Fury Road one step closer to becoming a documentary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve found this administration, and their stance not only on institutions but facts and numbers, is an outright attack on truth. Which, with every autocrat and in any dystopian novel, that\u2019s rule number one,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cThat there are still followers, I find that very dangerous. And that the attack from people who agree with the administration is to paint it as an \u2018us vs them\u2019 situation. Especially us, the libtards, the Hollywood libtards.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom the moment Meloni noted that he \u201cwoke up in a George Orwell novel today,\u201d the actor has been an active, outspoken and occasionally shirtless voice of #resistance. \u201cThe message\u2014which I\u2019m very poor at conveying, I\u2019ll be the first to admit\u2014is that the fight is not \u2018us vs them,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe fight is not against anything. It\u2019s for truth. And you have to agree on the truth. You can have debates on it, but you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aHe trails off, gazing at his hands. After all, he is here to promote Snatched, not a revolution. Finally, he looks up. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t deny the science of something like climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeloni\u2019s eyes, more like two storm clouds somehow bored into a rock face, have a way of making simple phrases like \u201cyou just can\u2019t\u201d sound very much like a universally acknowledged fact taught in schools across the nation. Of course I\u2019m not going to argue. If any actor has to keep an eye (or two) on our politicians, maybe it should be Chris Meloni.\u000a\u000aActually, we should probably talk about the eyes. Have you ever had Chris Meloni squint at you? It\u2019s terrifying, it really is. It\u2019s the squint that served him so well over 12 seasons and 273 episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as Detective Elliot Stabler. It\u2019s the gaze that\u2014and this is a compliment\u2014makes his August Pullman such an effectively enigmatic bounty hunter on WGN America\u2019s slave-era drama, Underground. Hell, it\u2019s the haunted stare of Meloni\u2019s psychotic yet oddly tender Chris Keller I still remember most from HBO\u2019s groundbreaking prison piece, Oz.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve had that since I was a child,\u201d Meloni tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a look, a certain stare. It\u2019s not cultivated, it just is.\u201d\u000a\u000aFunny enough, it\u2019s that look, the certain stare that allows Meloni to move so fluidly, and so often between drama and comedy. Keep his simmering intensity and simply change the context, and suddenly he\u2019s Roger in Snatched, exuding the confidence of Indiana Jones while displaying the skill-set of your local Sports Authority\u2019s junior manager. Or, if you will, suddenly he\u2019s Gene in 2001\u2019s summer-camp comedy Wet Hot American Summer\u2014David Wain\u2019s veritable who\u2019s who of comedy icons, A-listers and award-winners while they were all anything but\u2014the PTSD-ridden Vietnam veteran who also just so happens to be sexually attracted to refrigerators and prone to conversations with a talking can of vegetables (voiced by Archer\u2018s H. Jon Benjamin to boot).\u000a\u000aIn person, Meloni occupies that unique space between comedy and drama near-constantly. He lives in it, probably pays rent. I wondered for a while before this interview what kind of person I\u2019d be speaking to; intense or silly? The slave-catcher or the faux-adventurer? The horror show that was his Oz character, or the freak show that was, well, his Freakshow from Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle? The simplest answer is that he\u2019s both, simultaneously. He jokes, loud and often; when a member of his team requests some tunes, the actor puts on Manchester-based pop-rock band The 1975, a suggestion from his 16-year-old daughter. And yet whenever these endearing moments of levity do come up, Meloni\u2019s smile never quite un-arches those interrogation room eyebrows. It\u2019s not a surprise, then, that the method he describes for choosing his next project is an internal one, almost a zen process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, the spirit moves you,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe soul starts to need a different way to express itself. Whether you\u2019re immersed in comedy and suddenly you want to check out a drama, or if you\u2019ve been living in drama you might need a release valve. I\u2019m led by how I feel.\u201d\u000a\u000aRecently, the spirit led Meloni into the director\u2019s chair for only the second time in his career, when he helmed the season 2 episode of Underground, \u201cAuld Acquaintances.\u201d It was a far cry from his first effort\u2014a co-directing credit on National Lampoon\u2019s Dirty Movie in 2011\u2014that required, but was not limited to, blowing up a house, working around lead actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell\u2019s real-life pregnancy, and a lengthy, half-drunk monologue from his own character. \u201cAs an actor I\u2019m just concerned about me, my point of view vis-a-vi all the other actors and the moment,\u201d he says, then leans forward as if sharing a secret. \u201cAs a director, you have to be aware of everything.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re aware of the scene that happened before, while envisioning the scene after, and where this particular moment resonates, plus where each character\u2019s journey goes from here,\u201d he continues. \u201cThen you have to negotiate that, because maybe your idea doesn\u2019t sit with their idea. You have to make decisions on everything. How big do you want the bottle to be, what\u2019s the gun size? Is there a rug or isn\u2019t there a rug? You have to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page, and the page is your vision. Where to set up the camera, when that camera moves, how that camera moves.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy the expansion into directing? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s always that thought of \u2018Once I\u2019m done with this project, I\u2019m technically unemployed.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aClassic case of actor\u2019s dilemma, yes, but Meloni is set for the near-future at least. As part of the latest of what seems like many brand reboots, the SyFy network ordered a pilot for Happy!, adapted from Grant Morrison\u2019s graphic novel. Meloni will star as ex-cop turned mafia hitman Nick Sax, who gets his life back on track with the help of a tiny, blue winged horse voiced by Saturday Night Live\u2018s Bobby Moynihan.\u000a\u000aWhich is great news for fans of a dead-eyed Chris Meloni speaking to imaginary friends. In June, the actor also reprises his Wet Hot role for Netflix\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later (set a decade after the 2001 original, and acting as a follow-up to Netflix\u2019s surprisingly ingenious First Day of Camp). \u201cIt\u2019s all set. All in the can. Ready to roll,\u201d Meloni says on the status of the Wet Hot sequel, but is genuinely tight-lipped about where we will find the appliance-loving Gene.\u000a\u000aThe actor takes a long pause, then finally tells me \u201cGene is a solitary figure leading a life of mystery. He\u2019s trying to get his act together.

aVIn a series of recent tweets, Donald Trump proposed to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.

Thank you \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s tweets put me, as a classics scholar, in mind of a rather obscure fable thought to be written in early imperial Rome by one of the Emperor Augustus\u2019 freed slaves, Phaedrus. In this tale, a barbarian is threatening the troops of the military leader, Pompey the Great. All are afraid to challenge this fierce opponent until a \u201ccinaedus\u201d steps forward to volunteer for combat.\u000a\u000aAlthough foreign to us moderns, the cinaedus was a familiar figure to ancient Greeks and Romans, whose identity raised concerns about gender.\u000a\u000aThe cinaedus and the commander-in-chief\u000a\u000aThe cinaedus was frequently mentioned in classical sources due to his brazen effeminacy, untoward sexual behavior (most often a \u201cshocking\u201d desire to be anally penetrated by other men), and the ambiguous status of his genitalia.\u000a\u000aThis figure was first mentioned by Plato in the fourth century B.C., who says little more than that the cinaedus\u2019 life was terrible, base and miserable. Other classical authors provide more detail.\u000a\u000aMartial, a Roman poet writing in the first century A.D., for instance, describes a cinaedus\u2019 dysfunctional penis as like a \u201csoggy leather strap\u201d in one epigram. In the same century, the Roman novelist Petronius has a cinaedus suggest that both he and his fellows have had their genitals removed.\u000a\u000aIn Phaedrus\u2019 fable, the \u201ccinaedus\u201d is described as a soldier of great size but with a cracked voice and mincing walk. After pleading permission in a stereotypically lisping manner from Pompey, his commander-in-chief, the cinaedus steps into battle. He quickly severs the barbarian\u2019s head and, with army agog, is summarily rewarded by Pompey.\u000a\u000aWhat the cinaedus reveals about today\u000a\u000aHold Phaedrus\u2019 fable up and some easy similarities stand out with the situation today. The cinaedus is comparable to a contemporary trans person in that their expression of gender does not match the norms that their society \u2013 whether ancient or modern \u2013 expects of their sex as assigned at birth.\u000a\u000aAncient Greek and Roman sources show a bias against gender-variant people parallel to Trump\u2019s current-day attitudes.\u000a\u000aBoth the tweets and the fable display discomfort with the idea of gender-ambiguous fighters, regardless of any true situation on the ground. And while Trump professes exclusion of transgender people on grounds of financial cost and disruption, Phaedrus is a little more open about his motivations.\u000a\u000aIn Phaedrus\u2019 fable, the cinaedus is untrustworthy. He is described as having stolen valuables from Pompey and then later swears on oath that he hasn\u2019t. A clear connection is made between gender \u201cdeception\u201d and treacherous behavior.\u000a\u000aThis, I believe, is the same unfounded gender panic that Trump is drawing on to appeal to his traditional support base.\u000a\u000aGender diversity\u000a\u000aSuch consistency in attitudes across millennia is rather depressing. Some points in redress, however, are worth considering.\u000a\u000aThere are notable differences between a cinaedus and a trans person. The cinaedus was thought of as male, albeit with questionable masculinity. He is only ever described as being effeminate, never as identifying with, or living as, the opposite gender.\u000a\u000aIn my own work, I use the term \u201cgender diversity\u201d to point out loose, but still meaningful, connections between the ancient cinaedus with both modern trans people and others included under the LGBTQI+ umbrella.\u000a\u000aThe wide variety of effeminate men, masculine women, eunuchs and intersex individuals mentioned in classical sources suggests a breadth of experiences was possible outside of traditional gender norms.\u000a\u000aThere is some evidence of female masculinity in antiquity. The mythical women warriors of Greek mythology, the Amazons, might actually have had some basis in historical fact. In his book \u201cPostcolonial Amazons,\u201d scholar of ancient Greek Walter Penrose demonstrates that warrior women were prevalent and highly valued both in Scythian and ancient Indian cultures.\u000a\u000aAnd although classical scholars have debated whether any actual individual in antiquity ever embraced the stigma of being openly called a cinaedus, a series of tax receipts, letters and temple inscriptions from Greco-Roman Egypt do document men who were identified and notably identified themselves using this term.\u000a\u000aBeing trans and surviving adversity\u000a\u000aThe cinaedus has a long and persistent history. Being a topic of interest for writers from Plato in the fourth century B.C. through to Byzantine authors in the 11th century A.D., he is truly a survivor.\u000a\u000aAs gender studies scholar Jack Halberstam writes, trans people will likewise survive Trump\u2019s exclusionary tactics. For, as Phaedrus\u2019 little fable suggests, gender-diverse people have in all ages been capable of some mighty remarkable things.\u000a\u000aLike the victorious soldier cinaedus, they can confound expectations and achieve results in some of the most extremely adverse situations.\u000a\u000aTom Sapsford, Lecturer, University of Southern California \u2013 Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences\u000a\u000aThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Radziwill became royalty when she married Polish prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill in 1959\u2014they divorced in 1974.\u000a\u000aRadziwill splits her time between Paris and New York, but it seems she might be in France a bit less now. Radziwill is ready to sell her chic four-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment in the 8th arrondissement, overlooking Avenue Montaigne.\u000a\u000aThe apartment is on the sixth floor of a building that dates back to 1890, and is in \u201cperfect condition,\u201d according to the Emile Garcin listing.

aVIn December 2007, James Devine, a Union County political operative/newspaper publisher, was arrested for owing $20,000 in child support and alimony.\u000a\u000aIt was the latest fall from grace for Devine, a former Union County Democratic insider. Devine had been, as recently as a few years ago, a somewhat important operative in local political circles, running three weekly newspapers in Union County that depended heavily on financing from county advertisements and legal notices. But when that revenue stream abruptly ended, Devine was out of business and out of luck \u2013 a turn of events he blames on Elizabeth Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, a former political ally who he had a falling out with in the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aNow he\u2019s working to beat Bollwage, who is seeking re-election in the June 3 Democratic primary.\u000a\u000aBut Devine\u2019s detractors hold nothing but venom for a man they characterize as a charlatan who has mucked up the political scene in Union County for decades, and who recently had his bank account frozen for owing tens of thousands in back taxes \u2013 something Devine blames on bad legal advice and child support payments.\u000a\u000aSome public officials who are used to choosing their words carefully don\u2019t hesitate to go on the record slamming Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a sleaze ball, the worst in politics,\u201d said Democratic State Chairman Joseph Cryan, who also represents Union County in the State Assembly. \u201cIf they pay him anything, I hope he used it towards his child support.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter helping political newcomer Wilda Diaz topple eighteen-year incumbent Mayor Joseph Vas in Perth Amboy, Devine has set his sights on ousting Bollwage, who\u2019s held the office since 1993.\u000a\u000aDevine is helping run the campaigns of a slate of four candidates against Bollwage and three at-large council members: Edward Jackus, Frank Cuesta and Patricia Perkins-Auguste. The team is led by political neophyte Edward Bryant Koon, a juvenile detention officer. Running for council-at-large on Koon\u2019s slate are Board of Education President Armando Da Silva; George O\u2019Grady, the board of education\u2019s community-attendance liaison; and former councilman Samuel Rodriguez, who ran for mayor in 1988.\u000a\u000a\u201cI regret the mistakes that I made. I am sorry for them and I hope to make good,\u201d said Devine. \u201cI plan to straighten things out. I didn\u2019t file tax returns for several years. Why? Because I had no idea what my financial picture was. I don\u2019t have enough money to hire accountants to untangle the web that the courts and politicians have conspired against me with.\u201d\u000a\u000aDevine\u2019s feud with Bollwage goes back to 1991, when Devine challenged then-Elizabeth Mayor Thomas Dunn for his Assembly seat. Bollwage, Devine said, never came through with promised support for that campaign, and a year later \u2013 after Bollwage won his first term as mayor \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t support Devine for the 5th ward council seat.\u000a\u000aThe three community newspapers that Devine later picked up \u2014 The News Record and The Patriot \u2014 had essentially been mouthpieces Democratic Establishment in Union County (he also ran the The Adams Tabloid & Citizen Gazette in Middlesex). But after running some critical stories of Bollwage, Devine said, the mayor conspired with Union County Democratic Chairwoman Charlotte DeFilippo and State Sen. Raymond Lesniak to take away the county\u2019s business.\u000a\u000aDevine admitted that the papers leaned towards favoring his clients, but said that it\u2019s typical of small community papers.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore my eyes had been open, I probably was more sympathetic towards the government in Union County,\u201d said Devine. \u201cMy papers were a lot smaller than The Star-Ledger or any other paper that might make claims of journalistic integrity and objectivity, but these were probably no different than any other weekly papers in the state. Clearly there will be a difference when there\u2019s an iron wall between people who do advertising and editorial. In weekly newspapers it\u2019s the same guy, and it\u2019s the same guy who makes corporate decisions and takes out the garbage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy 2006, Devine unloaded the papers. Broke and beaten down from a divorce and car accident, he ultimately found himself missing child support payments, which he traces back to his papers\u2019 ruin.\u000a\u000aLesniak, for his part, denies Devine\u2019s claims of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat never happened. The county was, quite frankly, looking for ways to cut taxes, and that was an extra expense that wasn\u2019t really required,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there was a dispute as to whether he was charging the correct amount for the ads. He lost the Rahway ads as a result of that if I\u2019m not mistaken. I was very resentful of that because he was overcharging for the type sizes. So it was a combination: a dispute over his fees and looking to cut costs, and he took it personally.\u201d\u000a\u000aKoon, for his part, said that Bollwage doesn\u2019t acknowledge a gang problem that plagues the city, and has made crime and property taxes the top issue of his campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that our city needs a change,\u201d said Koon. \u201cTaxes have increased , we have serious gang problem and crime going on in our community, and I believe City Hall should make an effort to deal with crime. Instead of sitting back and doing nothing I\u2018ve decided to run for mayor.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the stronger denunciations of Bollwage come from Devine. The city has lost its well-paying manufacturing jobs, replaced by low wage part-time employers who don\u2019t provide benefits, he said. Bollwage ushered in a wave of development during his four terms as mayor and ten years on the council, like the Ikea just off the Turnpike and the Jersey Gardens Mall.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no Wal-Mart in Elizabeth, but Chris Bollwage did Wal-Mart Elizabeth,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aDevine sees a similarity between Bollwage\u2019s tenure as mayor and Vas in nearby Perth Amboy. They\u2019ve both been in office since the early 1990\u2019s, both remain personally popular, but may be vulnerable to a nationwide mood for change and complaints about tax increases.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople know the mayor and like him, but nobody should be mayor for 20 years,\u201d said Devine.\u000a\u000aLesniak disputes similarities between Bollwage and Vas. First off, unlike Vas, Bollwage never canceled a Puerto Rican Day Parade \u2013 something that put Vas at odds with his city\u2019s large Latino community. Moreover, unlike Diaz, Koon has little name recognition.\u000a\u000a\u201cMayor Vas had a credible opponent. Nobody knows Mayor Bollwage\u2019s opponent,\u201d said Lesniak.\u000a\u000aWhile some local politicos cast doubt on just how integral a role Devine played in the Perth Amboy upset, Diaz said that he did indeed help.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought that he did really well with us,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aBollwage defended his accomplishments as mayor, but refused to address anything having to do with Devine.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on him in any way shape or form. I\u2019m not going to comment on anything he has to say or do. He\u2019s not a candidate,\u201d said Bollwage. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on why political consultants do things. I always think it\u2019s because they\u2019re getting paid.\u201d\u000a\u000aBollwage dismisses his challenge as another aspect of the historically tense relationship between the city\u2019s school board and mayor\u2019s office, which began with Mayor Dunn\u2019s opposition to an elected school board. He argued that Koon was fielded to run for mayor because of an old association with the Superintendent of schools, and that two of Koon\u2019s running mates are affiliated with the school board.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019d like to show me out and run the whole show,\u201d said Bollwage.\u000a\u000aBollwage also says he has not ignored the city\u2019s crime problem, arguing that he\u2019s presided over the institution of after-school programs, expansion of the D.A.R.E. program and is working with prosecutors to make them a frequent presence at community meetings.\u000a\u000aHe points out that he can\u2019t be blamed for the city\u2019s loss of well-paying jobs, a condition far from unique to old industrial cities. Instead, he points to an unemployment rate that was somewhere between 11 and 12% at the beginning of his term, and stood at only 6.4% as of last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting that they would blame me for bringing in jobs. I find that a novel political argument,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blue collar jobs already left the community when I became mayor, so my choices were how to put people in the city of Elizabeth to work. What we did was take advantage of our location near Newark airport and other transportation, created a service economy where people that live here will have access to work and employment.\u201d

aVWhen \u201cBambi\u201d premiered in London on August 9, 1942, the fifth film from Walt Disney Animation Studios broke a lot of new ground. It was the first Disney film in which a character\u2019s parent dies early in the film \u2013 which is now a common plot device, as in \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cFrozen.\u201d It was the first Disney film without human characters. And it heralded a new development in animation: a shift away from visual realism, and toward abstractness.\u000a\u000aSince humans began painting in caves more than 40,000 years ago, and all the way through the 17th century, artists aimed to make realistic portrayals of their subjects. But not long after Vermeer cracked the puzzle of depicting three-dimensional perspective accurately on a two-dimensional canvas, something fundamental shifted: Realism began to give way to the more stylized and abstract art of Van Gogh and Monet through Picasso and Dali to Mondrian and Pollock and the advent of modern art.\u000a\u000aThe same trend happened in animation. \u201cSnow White,\u201d Disney\u2019s first animated film and the first full-length movie with every frame drawn by hand, was heralded for its realism. A multiplane camera allowed the film\u2019s artists to use shadows and three-dimensional effects to striking effect. Just five years later, in \u201cBambi,\u201d the studio was making conscious decisions to avoid realism in the artwork.\u000a\u000aAs a scholar and researcher of computer animation for movies and video games, I\u2019ve noticed this general trend toward realism followed by the intentional adoption of more abstract and stylized imagery can be seen across the visual arts, including in electronic media.\u000a\u000aStarting with realism\u000a\u000aWhen making \u201cBambi,\u201d Disney\u2019s animators had a strong initial focus on realism, sending artists to the Los Angeles Zoo to observe deer behavior and even keeping two fawns at the studio. That helped make the depictions of Bambi, his mother and the other deer very realistic. But the producers found the initial sketches of the forest background too busy and distracting.\u000a\u000aSo they intentionally substituted an impressionistic style to depict the forest backgrounds. By incorporating more detail at the center of the action and less detail near the edges, the artists were able to direct viewers\u2019 attention to the characters.\u000a\u000aSpreading to video games\u000a\u000aThe development of computer animation and video games followed a similar trajectory. The first arcade games, like \u201cComputer Space,\u201d \u201cPong,\u201d \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d and \u201cAsteroids,\u201d used vector graphics to display line drawings, the electronic equivalents of prehistoric cave art.\u000a\u000aRealism improved along with screen technology, and particularly with the increasing prevalence of raster displays, where the image is divided into a grid of individually illuminated pixels. Color brought \u201cDonkey Kong,\u201d and by the 1980s middle-class kids were playing \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d at home on their televisions.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the 1980s, improvements in graphics hardware achieved the video game equivalent of Vermeer\u2019s camera obscura. Then game designers could depict three-dimensional space on two-dimensional screens. Like the paintings of Vermeer, computer games were finally able to achieve the realism of accurate perspective, and keep the images flowing in real time with the gameplay.\u000a\u000aFor the next 25 years a primary goal of the video game industry was improving realism by incorporating shadows, texture, increasingly detailed geometry and ever more complex lighting effects. By 2015 and 2016, games like Bethesda Game Studios\u2018 \u201cFallout 4\u201d and EA DICE\u2019s \u201cBattlefield 1\u201d achieved breathtaking levels of realism, though they also made clear that there remains room for improvement.\u000a\u000aGoing mobile\u000a\u000aThe advent of the iPhone in the late 2000s led video games back away from realism. The new devices almost immediately spawned thousands of simple, two-dimensional, abstract and often highly stylized games. In this case the abstraction was more a product of need than a conscious choice: Smartphones are not powerful computers and cannot compute advanced graphics algorithms or achieve the realism of high-end gaming computers. But nearly everyone has a smartphone, so the mobile gaming industry has significantly expanded the number of people who play video games.\u000a\u000aPart of their popularity may be, in fact, that these new games aren\u2019t realistic, but rather silly and cute. Far more people have played \u201cWhere\u2019s My Water?\u201d and \u201cAngry Birds\u201d than \u201cFallout 4.\u201d There is even an \u201cAngry Birds\u201d movie.\u000a\u000aBack to the drawing screen?\u000a\u000aThis trend toward \u2013 and then away from \u2013 realism also appears in computer animation for the movie industry. Computers were first used to assist in traditional animation, where a seasoned animator draws a few important \u201ckey\u201d frames and a less-skilled assistant draws the frames in-between. In 1974 computers replaced the assistant in producing the (highly stylized) short film \u201cHunger.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the next two decades filmmakers increasingly used computers, like the computer-generated \u201cGenesis\u201d effect in 1982\u2019s \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\u201d and the T-1000 and other special effects in 1991\u2019s \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t until 1995 that Pixar released \u201cToy Story,\u201d the first feature-length animated film depicted in a three-dimensional world. Software representations of how light falls on a scene and interacts with the surfaces it hits were still primitive, and resulted in a very \u201cplastic\u201d look \u2013 which Pixar turned to its advantage by telling a story involving plastic toys. The human characters did not look realistic.\u000a\u000aIn the two decades since, the animation industry has made enormous progress in creating realistic virtual characters. There has been enormous progress even in the six years that separate Clu in \u201cTron: Legacy\u201d and Grand Moff Tarkin in \u201cRogue One.\u201d Before the end of the decade, we may see virtual characters that are indistinguishable from real actors.\u000a\u000aMoving back to stylized designs\u000a\u000aIn movies now, we are again seeing artists intentionally abandoning realism for stylization. Director Steven Spielberg originally planned his 2011 adaptation of the \u201cThe Adventures of Tintin\u201d as a live-action film, but his fellow producer Peter Jackson convinced Spielberg to shoot the film in a digital motion-capture studio to create a more stylized look that would more closely resemble the original comic.\u000a\u000aThe choices of moviemakers to use or not use realism have become artistic in nature. The 2.5-dimensional short \u201cWhat to do with CO2,\u201d made in 2013, is compelling because it isn\u2019t realistic.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, in 2015 Netflix used both realism and stylization for artistic effect in \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d \u2013 where the real world of the Little Girl was portrayed realistically, but her imagination of the world of the Little Prince is shown in stop-motion-like scenes.\u000a\u000aAcross all this time and all these technologies, a trend seems clear: Humans try to express reality. Once they do, they go back to making art.\u000a\u000aAdam Bargteil is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

aVDuring the 2016 Democratic primaries, Clinton advisor Joel Benenson said that if Sen. Bernie Sanders wanted more debates, he would have to change his \u201ctone\u201d\u2014even though the debates were scheduled to benefit Hillary Clinton. Now the same Democratic establishment forces are back to policing the tone of Sanders and his progressive movement. Since the primaries, the establishment has used smears, attacks, and condescension to ensure that party unity will be achieved on their terms. In February 2017, an anonymous Democratic senator told the Hill that Bernie Sanders needed to fall in line with the rest of the party. According to the senator, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer set up a meeting with Sanders and other senators to send a message to Sanders that he needed to \u201cplay nice.\u201d On August 9, BuzzFeed published an article with the same attitude toward Our Revolution President Nina Turner.\u000a\u000aMocking Turner\u2019s viable criticism of the DNC, the lede of BuzzFeed\u2019s article reads,\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018Dictatorial.\u2019 \u2018Arrogant.\u2019 \u2018Pompous.\u2019 \u2018Superficial.\u2019 \u2018Tone-deaf.\u2019 \u2018Tone-dead.\u2019 \u2018Out of line.\u2019 \u2018Insulting\u2019\u2014\u2019absolutely insulting.\u2019\u000a\u000aThese are the words that Nina Turner, president of the group founded by Bernie Sanders to further his \u2018political revolution,\u2019 used in an interview to describe the Democratic National Committee.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe article, which echoes DNC talking points, claims, \u201cShe\u2019s taking on the same institutional forces that are allied with Sanders.\u201d This is demonstrably false: Sanders is not allied with the DNC and Democratic establishment. The article tries to ostracize Nina Turner, as though she is causing trouble by speaking out against the DNC, which has done very little to change since the 2016 election. The article cited an incident in which Turner and several dozen supporters were met with barricades outside the DNC headquarters a few weeks ago when they tried to deliver an Our Revolution petition. Barricades were set up due to large crowds in the area. The article conveniently omitted that Turner was told to stay on the outside of the barricades when trying to deliver the petition. BuzzFeed also neglected to mention that one year ago, the DNC and Clinton campaign banned Turner from introducing Sanders at the Democratic National Convention.\u000a\u000aOf course, the DNC disputed Turner\u2019s account of the events. The organization argued that they have tried to include Our Revolution in discussions, citing a July meeting they didn\u2019t show up for and a Unity Tour with DNC Chair Tom Perez and Bernie Sanders in April. Sanders supporters perceived the Unity Tour as a joke, a poor effort to manufacture unity by using Sanders to try to make Perez more palatable to progressives. While supporters showed up in droves to hear Sanders, Perez received boos.\u000a\u000aBuzzFeed went on to undercut Sanders\u2019 political revolution:\u000a\u000a\u201cTurner\u2019s rise and Weaver\u2019s departure promise a new dynamic between Sanders and Our Revolution, likely one with more distance, current and former aides said. Although Weaver managed the group from something of a remove, spending much of this year working on a new book, he did serve as a central link to Sanders. To some of Sanders\u2019 hands, his exit was a signal that the senator\u2019s political focus lies elsewhere. To others, it meant a step away from the group\u2019s state and local campaign effort, which has struggled to secure victories under the Sanders banner.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe claim that making Nina Turner president of Our Revolution means that Sanders\u2019 interest in the group has dwindled is entirely baseless. Additionally, Our Revolution has not \u201cstruggled to secure victories.\u201d Of the candidates the group endorsed in 2016, more won than lost. In 2017, most of its candidates are still in the midst of campaigning, but they already have several victories, such as Chokwe Lumumba\u2019s election to mayor of Jackson, Miss., and Christine Pellegrino\u2019s New York State Assembly election victory in a district that Trump won. Our Revolution aims to challenge both Republicans and the donor-backed Democratic establishment. That it has been successful in this endeavor speaks to its power, enthusiasm and momentum.\u000a\u000aThe hit piece\u2019s notion that Sanders is allied with the Democratic establishment is naive at best. This week, Sanders wrote in an email to supporters about his push for single-payer health care, \u201cWe will be taking on the most powerful special interests in the country: Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the corporate media, the Republican Party and the establishment wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d Nothing has changed except the Democratic establishment reverting to pushing back against Sanders and his increasingly popular surrogates like Nina Turner. It appears the establishment is feeling the Bern from progressives and independents who have grown weary of a DNC and Democratic establishment that refuses to address the needs and interests of working-class, middle-class and low-income voters.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un are playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea got the world\u2019s attention \u2013 and Trump\u2019s \u2013 when it successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time on July 4. In response, the United Nations approved new economic sanctions against North Korea which, predictably, inspired a bellicose response from the rogue regime.\u000a\u000aTrump threatened that further provocations will be met with \u201cfire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response, North Korea issued a threat of its own \u2013 missile strikes on the U.S. territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aWith tensions escalating, it is important to be realistic about how we can get out of this mess.\u000a\u000aIn short, any nonmilitary solution will rely on China choosing to apply its massive economic leverage over the North Korean regime. This is a point that Trump clearly recognizes. In July, he tweeted that Chinese trade with North Korea \u201crose 40 percent in the first quarter,\u201d highlighting China\u2019s reluctance to punish North Korea for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aTrade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us \u2013 but we had to give it a try! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2017\u000a\u000aWhile the poor quality of the data hinders a detailed analysis, Trump\u2019s overall sentiment is correct. China has increased its trade with North Korea in recent years and done little to forestall North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions besides backing the most recent round of U.N. sanctions. China\u2019s foremost objective seems to be promoting greater stability from its volatile neighbor.\u000a\u000aYet a quick look at the data, however murky, shows just how much leverage China has, if it wishes to use it.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s primary patron\u000a\u000aIn general, exports from one country to another can be mostly explained by the distance between them and the sizes of their markets, a pattern that holds for China and North Korea.\u000a\u000aGeographically, they share a long border, which makes China a natural, though not inevitable, partner for trade. As a case in point, North Korea also shares a long border with South Korea, but these countries have almost no trade between them. In addition, North Korea shares a small border with Russia, with whom it has little, though ever-increasing, trade, as I discuss below.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s large market, proximity and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 willingness to trade with North Korea has led to a situation in which North Korea has become highly dependent on trade with what has become its primary patron. About half of North Korean exports and imports go directly to and from China and most of the rest of its trade is handled indirectly by Chinese middlemen.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s dependence on its neighbor has grown hand-in-hand with China\u2019s increasing economic dominance of East Asia, which gained momentum 15 years ago when China joined the World Trade Organization. Since then, both Chinese gross domestic product as well as its annual trade with North Korea have increased nearly tenfold, to around US$11 trillion and $6 billion, respectively.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea imports nearly everything from China, from rubber tires to refined petroleum to pears, with no single category dominating. Meanwhile, coal constitutes about 40 percent of North Korean exports to China, followed by \u201cnon-knit men\u2019s coats.\u201d\u000a\u000aTime to use that leverage?\u000a\u000aHowever, recent events \u2013 such as the use of front companies by Chinese firms to evade sanctions imposed on North Korea and China\u2019s reluctance to cut off energy supplies to the country \u2013 have led to some uncertainty about the extent to which China is willing to use this economic leverage to rein in North Korea\u2019s military ambitions.\u000a\u000aOn one hand, China claims that coal imports from North Korea have recently been stopped as part of an effort to punish the regime for recent missile tests and the suspected assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If true, this would be an important signal of China\u2019s willingness to support U.S. concerns about the missile program as it would represent a loss of about a third ($930 million) of North Korea\u2019s import revenue.\u000a\u000aHowever, there is evidence that coal shipments in fact never ceased. And, in any case, China may have dramatically increased its imports of iron ore from North Korea to offset the lost coal revenues.\u000a\u000aThis is consistent with the idea that China carefully considers the resources and revenue that are available to the North Korean regime at any moment, and uses trade as a lever to control them. In this way, China walks a fine line between providing too many resources, and thus allowing the regime to prosper, and not enough resources, such that North Korea is in danger of collapsing. Ultimately, trade may be used as a lever to do some light scolding, but China\u2019s overwhelming concern is preventing North Korea\u2019s collapse.\u000a\u000aFurther evidence that China has tight control over the North Korean economy comes from a recent report from C4ADS. The research group found close, and often common, ownership ties between most of the major Chinese companies who do business with North Korea. This suggests that trade with North Korea is highly centralized and thus easily controlled.\u000a\u000aRussia: North Korea\u2019s other \u2018friend\u2019\u000a\u000aChina is not the only country that North Korea trades with, though the others currently pale in comparison. Other top export destinations include India ($97.8 million), Pakistan ($43.1 million) and Burkina Faso ($32.8 million). In terms of imports, India ($108 million), Russia ($78.3 million) and Thailand ($73.8 million) currently sell the most to North Korea.\u000a\u000aRussia in particular may soon complicate U.S. efforts to isolate the regime. While still small, Russian trade with North Korea increased 73 percent over the first two months of 2017 compared with the same period of the previous year.\u000a\u000aBut whereas China is legitimately worried that an economic crisis in North Korea could lead to a flood of refugees or all-out war, Russia likely sees engagement with North Korea in much simpler terms, namely as an additional way to gain geopolitical advantage relative to the U.S.\u000a\u000aA way out?\u000a\u000aNearly all experts agree that there is no easy way to \u201csolve\u201d the North Korea problem. However, one plausible approach is to encourage South Korea and Japan to begin to develop nuclear weapons programs of their own, and to only discontinue these programs if China takes meaningful steps to use its trade with North Korea to reign in the regime.\u000a\u000aThreatening to introduce new nuclear powers to the world is clearly risky, however stable and peaceful South Korea and Japan currently are. But China is highly averse to having these economic and political rivals acquire nuclear capabilities, as it would threaten China\u2019s ongoing pursuit of regional control. In short, this is a sensitive pressure point that could be used to sway the Chinese leadership.\u000a\u000aOne way or another, China must become convinced that the costs of propping up the North Korean regime through trade are higher than the costs of an increased probability that the regime will collapse.\u000a\u000aThis is an updated version of an article originally published on July 6, 2017.\u000a\u000aGreg Wright is an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of California, Merced.

aVJennifer Lawrence\u2019s face is among the most recognizable in the world, thanks to her 2012 Oscar win for Best Actress, and starring roles in the The Hunger Games, X-Men films and the upcoming thriller mother!, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. But come September, when Lawrence\u2019s fans and fashion enthusiasts pick up the hotly anticipated September issue of Vogue magazine\u2014which this year marks the publication\u2019s 125th anniversary\u2014the actress\u2019 face will look a little different on one of its four specially commissioned covers, thanks to the brushwork of one of America\u2019s leading artists, reports the New York Times.\u000a\u000aThe venerable style bible has tapped painter John Currin to capture the actress\u2019 likeness for the occasion, in stark contrast with more traditional photo covers commissioned by photographers Bruce Webber, Annie Leibovitz and Inez and Vinoodh.\u000a\u000aNew York-based Currin, who is represented in the U.S. by mega dealer Gagosian gallery, is best known for his classically-influenced oil paintings, often featuring female figures. Critic Andrian Searle described Currin\u2019s work in his 2016 Guardian review of the artist\u2019s show at London\u2019s Sadie Coles gallery, saying, \u201cHis art is about flesh, manners, types, relationships and, most of all, the question of representation.\u201d\u000a\u000aCurrin\u2019s portrait of Lawrence could, perhaps, be summed up in kind. His painting features the actress donning a red and white, puffy Miu Miu hat tied with a ribbon, wearing a soft gold-colored chemise and holding a green clutch. Lawrence stares intently at the viewer, leaning forward in somewhat unnatural hunch which elongates her neck; she is neither smiling nor pouting, but her distinctively full lips and bright eyes are instantly familiar.\u000a\u000aWriter Dodie Kazanjian told the Times, \u201cOne of the reasons I thought John would be good for the cover was that fashion was a huge influence on his work early on.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Currin told to the Times that in accepting to do the cover, \u201cI do worry about decorum,\u201d he explained that the magazine format provided the opportunity to challenge the conventions of oil painting. \u201cI was interested mostly in seeing my work in a completely different way,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn Vogue\u2018s video featurette on the making of the four covers, Kazanjian spoke with Currin by phone, asking, \u201cWhat were the problems of working with a celebrity?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot knowing how to get it to look like her,\u201d the artist said. \u201cAnd the other problem is everybody knows what she looks like, so millions of people will see any mistakes you make.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the magazine\u2019s cover story, Lawrence described her experience working with Currin to writer Jason Gay by saying, \u201cHe took photos, and posed me like one of those French girls.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is Vogue\u2018s first fine art cover since Andy Warhol\u2019s 1983 image of Caroline of Monaco for its French edition, according to the Times. Other artists who have produced covers in the magazine\u2019s now 125-year history include Salvador Dali and Giorgio de Chirico.\u000a\u000aTo see all four covers and read Vogue\u2018s full profile on Jennifer Lawrence, see Vogue.com.

aVThe NJ Sharing Network Foundation is welcoming Yvonne Payne of Teaneck to its Board of Trustees \u2013 two years after she received a life-saving heart transplant.\u000a\u000aPayne eagerly looks for opportunities to honor the memory of child actress Sammi Kane Kraft, whose tragic death in a 2012 California car crash meant a new heart and a new chance at life for Payne.\u000a\u000aPayne lead a team at NJ Sharing Network\u2019s 5K Walk and USATF-Certified Race on June 8, raising thousands of dollars for the life-saving mission.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am touched by the entire NJ Sharing Network organization,\u201d Payne said. \u201cI definitely want to help out and ensure as many people as possible know the importance of registering for organ donation, especially in the Black and Latino communities. I want to share my story with others and hope they can support this beautiful organization.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayne \u2013 wife of Fox Business Network contributor Charles Payne \u2013 is inspired by her heart donor, Sammi Kane Kraft. Kraft, whose real-life baseball skills landed her the starring role as a spunky pitching ace in the 2005 remake of \u201cBad News Bears,\u201d died Oct. 9, 2012, at the age of 20.\u000a\u000aFour days later, Payne underwent heart transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Today, the lively 56-year-old Teaneck woman is determined to give back something tangible to other people in need \u2013 including her service to the Foundation.\u000a\u000aPayne recalls an \u201cactive and athletic childhood,\u201d but rheumatic fever at age 13 left her with a weak heart and prone to fatigue due to arrhythmia. \u201cI learned to cope and tried to be as active as possible as a teenager and young adult,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy heart always seemed so noisy in my chest,\u201d she recalled. In her mid-30s Payne was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening rapid heartbeat that ultimately required her to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctors told me I would eventually need a heart transplant. That was a frightening idea, so I kept telling myself and everyone else that I\u2019d be just fine,\u201d Payne said. By 2011, her condition worsened and her bouts of exhaustion became more frequent.\u000a\u000aPhysicians at New York Presbyterian implanted a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in July 2012 to provide temporary relief. \u201cAn LVAD is a bridge-to-a-transplant until a heart is available,\u201d said Payne, noting that her recovery and potentially long wait for a donor brought on \u201cfear and depression.\u201d\u000a\u000aA personal phone call from former Vice President Dick Cheney helped lift Payne\u2019s spirits. \u201cIt meant so much. Mr. Cheney had LVAD surgery too. He told me to have faith, stay strong and leave my depression behind,\u201d said Payne, who had met Cheney once while visiting friends in Wyoming.\u000a\u000aWhile the LVAD helped for a short while, her condition turned critical less than three months later when she developed a blood clot in the LVAD and doctors told her she needed an immediate heart transplant.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also needed a miracle,\u201d Payne said. It came in an emotional phone call from Shelly and Lulu Kane Kraft \u2013 Sammi\u2019s parents and friends of Payne\u2019s husband, Charles. \u201cThey knew about my condition, kept me in their prayers and were calling to say they wanted their daughter\u2019s passing to help me live,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWithin 48 hours, the Paynes flew to Los Angeles and Yvonne underwent transplant surgery at Cedars Sinai. \u201cThe first thing I recall when I woke up after surgery was the quiet. It was the first time my heart was really ever silent,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDirected organ donation, which Payne underwent, is not normal for emergency situations and is considered rare. Most people receive the gift of donation from an anonymous donor. For directed organ donation, blood types must be compatible between donors and intended recipients.\u000a\u000aToday, Payne is devoting time and energy to offer hope to others facing heart transplants and making a similar journey through her service with the NJ Sharing Network Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cYvonne\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment is an inspiration to us all,\u201d said Elisse Glennon, executive director, NJ Sharing Network Foundation. \u201cWe are excited to be working with her. She is a dynamic person who will be instrumental in helping us achieve our goals. We are especially pleased about her commitment to outreach to minority communities and look forward to working closely with her in the coming months and years.\u201d

aVIntermittent fasting (IF)\u2014not eating for up to 16 hours at a time (usually breaking the fast around lunch)\u2014is trending in the wellness world today, with some experts believing IF can help you shed unwanted pounds as well as improve cognitive function. Weight loss makes sense, but could fasting really have an impact on your brain? It\u2019s possible. Let\u2019s take a deep dive into understanding what happens in your body, and how your systems work together, when your body consumes food.\u000a\u000aWhen examining how IF can impact brain health, it\u2019s important to understand what happens with that critical organ during the digestive process. Because your brain is the main communication center for your body, a key element to note in this relationship is how your brain works to produce hormones.\u000a\u000aYour endocrine system is responsible for hormonal production and balance, which helps your body to grow and develop. However, the initial communication for hormonal regulation is triggered by your brain. Your hypothalamus, more easily referred to as the \u201ccontrol center,\u201d scans your hormone levels multiple times per day. The hypothalamus is in constant communication with your pituitary gland to stimulate hormone production from either the adrenal, thyroid or parathyroid glands.\u000a\u000aYour thyroid is responsible for many crucial functions in your body as well; it regulates body temperature, heart rate, growth, and metabolism, to name just a few. Your metabolism (or your body\u2019s ability to break down food and convert it into energy) is crucial for survival. Your thyroid produces two types of hormone to regulate system function: T3 and T4 (one active, one inactive). They help to directly regulate your metabolism. These are constantly in flux due to the signals your brain is communicating. Your thyroid works in a feedback loop with your brain to keep your metabolism running smoothly.\u000a\u000aHowever, consuming excessive amounts of food, particularly of the sugary and starchy variety (which will elevate your blood sugar rapidly) or processed foods (which your body has a hard time recognizing as immediate fuel), can all impact that feedback loop, thus causing your brain and your thyroid to become sluggish. This leads to a slowing of your metabolism; what that means, is weight gain.\u000a\u000aKeeping all of that in mind, it\u2019s important to explore ways that we can keep our brain fresh, healthy and not over-burdened with unnecessary duties so that we can think clearly, respond quickly, and live a healthy, happy life. This is how intermittent fasting can produce incredible, brain-boosting benefits to your cognitive health.\u000a\u000aSo how does IF help? When food is consumed, excess fuel that isn\u2019t immediately used by your body is stored by the hormone insulin in the form of glucose, which is typically released when there is excess sugar in your bloodstream. Sensitivity to insulin can decrease over time if you continue to overeat\u2014especially excessive amounts of sugar. Excess glucose that is unable to be stored by your cells winds up getting stored as fat in your muscle and tissues.\u000a\u000aThe IF technique can be done in a variety of ways, but\u2014as mentioned earlier\u2014the theory is that you go for prolonged periods of time between meals (hence, the term fasting). Periods of fasting can last anywhere from 12 hours (typically the average time between dinner at night and breakfast the next morning), 16 hour fasts (between dinner and lunch the next day is common), or going a full 24 hours in between meals. The latter method is recommended by some doctors who believe intermittent fasting is a beneficial seasonal exercise, detoxifying the body from the previous season and getting it ready for the new equinox.\u000a\u000aIt should be emphasized that when you are going through a period of abstaining from food, it is strongly encouraged by wellness professionals to drink plenty of water and get plenty of rest, so that your body can do the work it needs to do to detoxify, repair and recover.\u000a\u000aOn average, your body takes about 4 to 5 hours to digest a meal. Your body will use that digested food as immediate energy, burning it as the first line of energy defense. However, it\u2019s during the hours that follow that your body will begin to dip into its stored glycogen. This is also call your fuel reserve, and it\u2019s typically fat stored in your muscles and tissues.\u000a\u000aThus, a short-term effect of intermittent fasting is that stored fuel gets depleted and so a rapid loss of fat is a common result. People will often see instant results with fasting, like initial weight loss, a feeling of lightness, and relief of bloating, constipation, and other digestive issues. But in addition, there are also incredible cognitive benefits to undergoing periods of IF. Because your body is not introducing new food during a period of fasting, it goes through a period of recovery. During this time it will work to eliminate inflammation and repair the areas where it occurred. Inflammation has been proven to be the precursor of many debilitating diseases\u2014including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Most recently, it has been correlated with the occurrence of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u000a\u000aFasting for more than six hours allows your body to go into the \u201ccleansing\u201d phase, cleaning up damaged cells, recycling waste products produced by damaged cells, and repairing and strengthening the remaining ones to improve your state of health. These types of genetic repairs are stimulated by the release of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH works to strengthen and improve the function of your body\u2019s muscles, organs and internal systems. Research also suggest that HGH helps the brain with neural processing and synaptic functioning, stimulating your brain\u2019s memory and efficiency of thought processing. Studies from the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute have shown that men who fasted for 24 hours had a 2,000 percent increase in circulating HGH, and women had a 1,300 percent increase.\u000a\u000aFasting, of course, may not be for everyone (especially those with serious health conditions) but if you\u2019re fit, healthy, and interested in the process, it is absolutely worth experimenting with on your own or with the support of a practitioner. This technique could be the key to resolving both your mental struggles, and your weight loss woes.\u000a\u000aJamie Forward is a Holistic Health Coach based in the Jersey City/ NYC area.

aVI have a lot of great things in the works. A lot. But I needed money. So I went to a temp agency. They asked me if I knew how to use Excel and if I had good organizational skills. I lied.\u000a\u000aI met with a round of women who made sure I had all my limbs, good skin and a pleasant disposition.\u000a\u000aI have big things in the works. Dreams so close, like an almost finished memoir and perhaps a role on Real Housewives of New York. But, even so, freelance checks staggered in late and I had a pit in my stomach.\u000a\u000aDuring my lows, I wondered if I was fit for living at all. If only I could dream in money and numbers like those men (and fewer women) at big banks.\u000a\u000aAnd then an opportunity appeared in my inbox.\u000a\u000a\u201cTemporary Administrative Receptionist at Hedge Fund, $20 per hour, 10AM- 2PM Monday through Friday. Are you interested?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe best part of the job was that it was temporary.

What will I wear?\u000a\u000a****\u000a\u000aMy friend Mandy recently found herself entangled in a hedge fund tragedy. Mandy had dabbled in the art world, modeling, and whatever, until she hit rock bottom and slept on my parents\u2019 couch for five nights straight. That\u2019s when she finally got her shit together and decided to take a job she hated.\u000a\u000aShe wore Dolce & Gabbana and pumps (standard office attire) and, of course, fell for her boss. He was a typical man, serious, making deals with thick thumbs tapping on the table ratatatap.\u000a\u000aMandy was crazy in the way women can get. Unorganized chaos, unpredictable, far from linear. Even with a regular paycheck, shit went wrong. Like once, a sharp knife ricocheted off the kitchen counter, missed her co-worker, and stabbed Mandy in the thigh. She smiled. Another time, a glass crumpled in her hand just like that.\u000a\u000aAnd somehow she ended up an executive assistant, organizing her boss\u2019s life, a joke. This hot mess wasn\u2019t one for fixing.\u000a\u000aShe had to do awful things like maintain his calendar, oversee his yacht staff and helicopter schedule, take orders, be pleasant, and pretend she gave a shit. There was only one thing to do: Fuck him.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s get real. She had him from the moment she walked in the door. She only got the job because she was attractive. And as GetBullish\u2019s Jennifer Dziura wrote on Facebook, \u201cBeautiful women can always seemingly get in the door. But then they get blocked in the doorway and harassed because the opportunity wasn\u2019t real in the first place.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Mandy was determined to do the harassing herself. She\u2019d break down this hot-headed alpha male like a little bitch, even if it killed her.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t complicated. She wore stilettos, propped up her tits, nipped her waist in a pencil skirt, and leaned over and lingered. Next thing you know, she\u2019s sucking his cock and he\u2019s buying her tennis bracelets.\u000a\u000aThe whole thing was a bad idea, so they moved in together.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d surprise her with sweet little nothings like wads of cash, $10k at a time (which she really appreciated), and it seemed they were in love. Then one night, Mr. Hedge Fund\u2019s trusted driver pulled up to their town house. He had fallen for Mandy himself and bore bad news. Mr. Hedge Fund had been sleeping with many a pretty lady at the company. Each night he left with a different assistant, hooking up in the back seat. The driver watched. He had footage. Did she want to see?\u000a\u000aMandy was angrier than an ocean storm, and man should know never to fuck with the ocean. She saw Mr. Hedge Fund at the top of the staircase and crashed into him like a weapon. He lost his balance and tumbled to the bottom. He was only bruised (didn\u2019t die or anything major), but he did fire and break up with her. She was just trying to make a point, and never intended on hurting him; she thought he was too big and strong to fall.\u000a\u000aMandy still wears that goddamn diamond tennis bracelet.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aI got this. I can do Finance. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be betting on other people\u2019s money, anyways, and I\u2019ll certainly get to dish out smiles. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m on the set of Mad Men. \u201cHello,\u201d I\u2019ll grin, \u201cand welcome to X Fund. Can I offer you a coffee? Well, then, how about some water? Sparking or flat?\u201d I\u2019ll take notes for my next novel, The Receptionist. A thriller, where the women were all once brilliant creative types\u2014a violinist, an opera singer, a painter\u2014whose dreams died when they started making real money. Forget about art and bettering the world.\u000a\u000aMy interview is tomorrow and I feel nothing but dread. This is what responsibility must taste like. The temp agent sends me an encouraging message, \u201cGood luck!\u201d like I\u2019m up for a big part in a Spielberg film.\u000a\u000aAttached to her email, a PDF with interview tips.\u000a\u000aThe Most Important Non-Verbals:\u000a\u000aEye Contact: Don\u2019t assume you have good eye contact. Watch yourself on a videotape. Ask. Watch. Practice. Facial Expressions: Take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror. Eliminate any negative overall characteristics that might exist. Posture: Stand tall, walk tall and, most of all, sit tall. Gestures: Should be limited. You will come off as theatrical. Space: Recognize the boundaries of your personal space and that of others. If you are typical of most Americans it will range between 30-36 inches. Be prepared, however, not to move away from someone whose personal space is smaller than your own. Hang in there, take a deep breath, and stand your ground. If you have a smaller than average personal space, make sure you keep your distance so that you don\u2019t intimidate someone who possesses a larger personal space.\u000a\u000aI feel sick.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aI got this. And no, I\u2019m not going to fuck my boss like Mandy. But just as I get cocky, an email. My interview\u2019s been postponed.\u000a\u000aSeveral days later, a thoughtful note from the temp agent, \u201cI just left word to see what the hold up is and will be back to you soon.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd then the final blow, \u201cSorry, but they went in a different direction.\u201d\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t get the part. Sweet relief mixed with terror. Perchance, it didn\u2019t help that if one Googles my name \u201csex\u201d is pretty much everywhere next to it, along with some very tasteful lingerie shots.\u000a\u000aAnd then God heard my prayers, a residual check from a TV show I co-starred in 2012 landed in my mail box. It seems the \u201cTemporary Administrative job at Hedge Fund\u201d just wasn\u2019t for me, which is probably for the best, because I don\u2019t like to be told what do unless, of course, I\u2019m in bed. My corporate American fantasy may be dead, but at least I get to write about sex.

aVBack in April, Fox News parted ways with Bill O\u2019Reilly amid sexual harassment claims levied at the popular TV host. Since then, O\u2019Reilly has not been scooped up by a major outlet, though he has produced a daily podcast for No Spin News. On Wednesday, O\u2019Reilly took his first step back toward the limelight as he debuted an experimental 30-minute online news show.\u000a\u000aTHR reports that the new show is available to premium subscribers to his website for live viewing and available for non-paying visitors on Thursday.

aVChristie\u2019s will offer items from the expansive collection of Thermo Electric heir and arts patron Paul F. Walter in a two day sale this September, according to an announcement from the auction house. On September 26 and 27, Christie\u2019s will offer over 560 lots from the collector\u2019s Manhattan and Sag Harbor homes, including furniture and decorative arts, sculpture, Indian art, post-war and contemporary art and photography.\u000a\u000aWalter, who died in January of this year, was the son of New Jersey-based industrial instruments company Thermo Electric\u2019s founders, Fred and Anna Walter. He inherited a passion for the arts from his parents\u2014also active cultural benefactors\u2014and went on to hold leadership positions at both MoMA and the Met, in addition to taking the reigns at Thermo Electric in 1968. He was known just as much for his collecting as he was his lending and financial support of arts institutions, according to Christie\u2019s, and gifted significant photography holdings to both institutions, including works by Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson. In his lifetime, Walter also gifted works to Oberlin College, LACMA and the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat united Paul\u2019s aesthetic was his true passion for collecting\u2014and it was phenomenal,\u201d said Laura Paulson, vice chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas advisory board said in a statement. \u201cHe would create highly personal environments with great attention to detail and beauty, and this translated into everything he brought into his life.\u201d\u000a\u000aHighlights of the sale include early photographs from Captain Linnaeus Tripe, Edward Steichen and Man Ray, in addition to an archive of photos, sketch books and manuscripts which once belonged to Beaton.\u000a\u000aAlso included are works on paper from Brice Marden and Agnes Martin, and pieces by Robert Mapplethorpe and Robert Wilson, along with examples of English furniture and designs from the Arts and Crafts movement, and a significant selection of Indian Art,\u000a\u000aWorks sale are valued between $1,000 and $1.2 million, and the sale is predicted to total near $4.5 million.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Collection of Paul F.

aVThe California Democratic Party is continuing to stonewall California Democratic Party chair candidate Kimberly Ellis\u2019 efforts to review the chair election to ensure its fairness. Establishment Democrats threatened Ellis, who supported Hillary Clinton but received an endorsement from Our Revolution, before the election saying, \u201cPolitically speaking, you will be murdered and we will personally take part in murdering you,\u201d according to Ellis. Over 3,000 California Democratic Party insiders participated in the initial election. Ellis lost by 62 votes, but the California Democratic Party Compliance Review Commission found 223 problematic votes. Recently, the commission reviewed ballots and invalidated 47 of them. The establishment candidate, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Eric Bauman, has a reputation for harassment and bullying. During a DNC Resistance Summer event in Los Angeles a few weeks ago, activists walked out before Bauman spoke in protest to the race.\u000a\u000aOn August 8, Ellis issued a press release announcing her request for an arbitration to avoid a legal battle with the California Democratic Party. Ellis said in the press release, \u201cIf what they\u2019re really saying is \u2018give it up\u2019 and \u2018go away,\u2019 then we are truly at an impasse. In the past, we\u2019ve offered to pay for an independent forensic audit and were rebuffed. We asked for an impartial or balanced review commission and were told no. If their goal is to avoid a legal battle, here it is. The ball is in their court.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a rebuttal, a spokesperson for the California Democratic Party told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cMs. Ellis is now deep in her own end zone and throwing a desperate Hail Mary pass in hopes of changing the outcome of an election that she lost fair and square.\u201d The LA Times added, \u201cEllis, a progressive Bay Area organizer, narrowly lost the race to long-time party activist Eric Bauman during an election held during the state party\u2019s annual convention in May in Sacramento. She never conceded the race, and her campaign has repeatedly and unsuccessfully contested the results, alleging ballot stuffing, bias and corruption on the part of the California Democratic Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe California Democratic Party has insisted that Ellis\u2019 efforts are broadening the rift within the Democratic Party but has refused to acknowledge their role in causing that rift. Further, their excuses do not hold much weight because Democrats in California hold the governorship, a supermajority in the state legislature, and have been comfortably out fundraising the California Republican Party\u2014with the help of corporate and wealthy donors who have blocked progressive policies.\u000a\u000aCalifornia has become a microcosm that shows the Democratic establishment\u2019s corruption and why the \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d argument only serves the status quo. It is not enough to just have politicians with a \u201cD\u201d next to their name in elected office, as California continues to demonstrate. Yet, the Democratic establishment has no problem subverting democracy to preserve their own political power.

aVIn 2015, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted on bribery charges. Prosecutors alleged that he accepted nearly $1 million in bribes through campaign donations, vacations, and private jet flights in return for doing political favors for a Florida optometrist, Salomon Melgen, a co-defendant in the case. In April 2017, Melgen was found guilty of Medicare fraud. Menendez pressed Obama\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary for leniency in the case. In addition, Menendez also tried to use his political influence to coerce U.S. officials to pressure the Dominican Republic to benefit one of Melgen\u2019s companies. He also intervened in acquiring visas for Melgen\u2019s foreign girlfriends. Since 2014, Menendez has raised $4.6 million for legal expenses and has continued to raise campaign funds for his re-election bid in 2018.\u000a\u000aMenendez first won election to the Senate in 2006. He was a Hillary Clinton superdelegate in 2016 and served as her national campaign co-chair during her failed 2008 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aOn August 9, a federal judge denied Menendez\u2019s last chance to avoid a trial this September. His attorneys tried to argue that his indictment should be overturned due to the Supreme Court decision that essentially normalized corruption by overturning former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s corruption conviction in June 2016. In the ruling against Menendez, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls wrote, \u201cWhether the acts alleged in the Superseding Indictment satisfy the definition of an \u2018official act\u2019 under McDonnell is a factual determination that cannot be resolved before the Government has the opportunity to present evidence at trial.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn addition to McDonnell\u2019s successful overturning of a corruption conviction, former New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver managed to have his corruption conviction overturned in July 2017 due to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision narrowing the definition of political corruption, though federal prosecutors are working on re-trying the case. Former Congresswoman Corinne Brown is currently undergoing efforts to have her corruption conviction from May 2017 overturned.\u000a\u000aThis trend of permitting high-profile public officials to remain in elected office after receiving federal indictments normalizes corruption. Civilians indicted on charges related to their jobs are typically fired or forced to resign. Public officials should be held to even higher standards than people in the private sector because they are accountable to their constituents. Instead, standards of conduct have been deteriorating, leading to political antipathy across the country because voters increasingly feel that public officials prioritize their personal interests and those of their wealthy donors.\u000a\u000aWhat kind of representation are constituents receiving when public officials behave in ways where they have to worry about staying out of jail because of actions they took in office? As American citizens, public officials have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but constituents also have the right to unencumbered representation. Politicians should not be allowed to act above the law and get away with it.\u000a\u000aUpdate: The Palm Beach Post reported that Melgen\u2019s sentencing in a separate trial was abruptly postponed, fueling speculation he may be cooperating with authorities in the Menendez case.

aVCelebrity feuds are always entertaining, whether it\u2019s Father John Misty versus a stolen crystal or the most recent reality television showdown between Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay and commitment-phobe finalist Peter Kraus.\u000a\u000aBut one particularly memorable dispute has been going down for the last couple of days, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to stop anytime soon. Kendall Jenner, the second youngest Kardashian/Jenner daughter, has been facing off against Brooklyn venue Baby\u2019s All Right. Jenner is best known for being the most controversial Kardashian\u2014remember her Pepsi commercial? Baby\u2019s is known for providing low-key celebrity sightings, mostly because truly everyone looks like Lonely Boy (and sometimes it is actually him, as Gossip Girl\u2018s Penn Badgley often plays there).\u000a\u000aThe celeb-studded conflict began when the Williamsburg venue posted an Instagram featuring Jenner\u2019s blank tip line, captioned with the helpful reminder, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tip your bartender :)\u201d and arguments immediately ensued. The comments ranged from \u201cSo do you guys do this to all customers that don\u2019t tip..\u201d to \u201cIs that tip served on the menu?\u201d\u000a\u000adamn, i guess next time we won't tip in cash https://t.co/iZ4tFt3pg7 \u2014 Kendall (@KendallJenner) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aJenner announced that she paid in cash on Twitter in response to a fan, and then the Brooklyn bar deleted their Instagram. One would think the story was over, but the saga continues. Baby\u2019s reposted her response with the Nietzsche quote, \u201cI\u2019m not upset that you lied to me, I\u2019m upset that from now on I can\u2019t believe you,\u201d along with the useful hashtag #nocashtip. Now, both photos are deleted, but the memories live on.\u000a\u000aIt looks like the only Kardashian to come out on top is Kylie Jenner, who was called a \u201cBillion-Dollar Baby\u201d this morning on the cover of WWD. Plus, at 19, the reality star and cosmetics mogul can\u2019t yet legally drink, so hopefully she won\u2019t be fighting against local bars anytime soon.

aV\u201cA crippling problem.\u201d \u201cA total epidemic.\u201d \u201cA problem like nobody understands.\u201d These are the words President Trump used to describe the opioid epidemic ravaging the country during a White House listening session in March.\u000a\u000aThe percentage of people in the U.S. dying of drug overdoses has effectively quadrupled since 1999, and drug overdoses now rank as the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.\u000a\u000aDrugs do exist to reverse opioid overdoses or treat long-term opioid addiction. But while opioids have become easier and easier to obtain through illicit markets and sellers on the dark web, a drug that could save countless lives has become increasingly out of reach.\u000a\u000aConsider the addiction treatment drug, Suboxone. Patents and other exclusivities on the basic version of Suboxone expired some time ago, yet the price remains sky-high, and access problems persist. Oral film strips now cost over US$500 for a 30-day supply; even simple tablets cost a whopping $600 for a 30-day supply. The cost alone puts the medication out of reach for many.\u000a\u000aI study the pharmaceutical industry, and I see how drug companies are able to play games that keep competition out and prices high. Lack of access to addiction treatment drugs like Suboxone can be traced, in part, to the soaring prices, access problems and anti-competitive conduct that has become business as usual in the pharmaceutical industry across the board.\u000a\u000aPatent incentives\u000a\u000aPharmaceutical companies have brought tremendous advances in medicine. I believe they should be adequately compensated for the enormous amount of time and resources needed to develop a new drug. Our intellectual property system is designed to do just that, rewarding companies that bring new drugs to market with a competition-free period \u2013 20 years from the patent application date \u2013 during which they can recoup their profits.\u000a\u000aAfter this defined period, generic versions of the drug are supposed to appear on pharmacy shelves, bringing down prices to levels that can be borne more easily by consumers and the health care market generally.\u000a\u000aBrand-name companies, however, engage in myriad games to make sure theirs is the only version of the drug on pharmacy shelves, long after generics should have joined the ranks.\u000a\u000aMartin Shkreli, the infamous pharmaceutical industry CEO responsible for hiking the cost of his company\u2019s lifesaving drug from $13.50 to $750 overnight, once tweeted that \u201cEvery time a drug goes generic, I grieve.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it is not just a case of a few bad apples. Complex schemes to hold off generic competition are widespread throughout the pharmaceutical industry, as I have found in my research.\u000a\u000aThe games pharma plays, sort of like Monopoly®\u000a\u000aLegislators on both sides of the aisle have decried sky-high drug prices, but it can be hard to pin down the specific behavior to address. Pharmaceutical game-playing has grown over the decades into a multi-headed monster, with a new tactic popping up as soon as the old one is cut off. My colleague and I set out to clearly identify and expose these various games in our book, \u201cDrug Wars: How Big Pharma Raises Prices and Keeps Generics Off the Market.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne game we analyzed involved the filing of petitions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that raise unfounded or frivolous concerns in an effort to delay generic competitors.\u000a\u000aSome of the petitions were just stunning to us. For example, some petitions soberly ask the FDA to require, well, what it already requires, such as ensuring that the generic drug product is stable and has an appropriate shelf life. Other petitions tie the application up in knots for reasons that are hard, even for the FDA, to discuss with a straight face.\u000a\u000aFor example, the company that manufactures the blood pressure medicine Plendil filed a petition asking the FDA to delay approval of generics by citing concerns over how different types of oranges in orange juice might affect absorption of the medication and demanding additional information on the juice used in the clinical trials.\u000a\u000aAlthough 80 percent of these petitions are eventually denied, it takes time and resources for the FDA to review each petition.\u000a\u000aCiting concerns over citizen petition games, Congress recently required the FDA to respond to such petitions within five months, but a five-month delay for a blockbuster drug can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. (The Federal Trade Commission recently filed an antitrust suit against Shire ViroPharma for attempts to hold off competition related to its gastrointestinal drug Vancocin, a campaign that included 24 filings related to a single petition.) Congress also gave the FDA the ability to summarily deny petitions when appropriate, a power that the FDA has failed to use even once.\u000a\u000aBy parsing through 12 years of FDA data, we found that out of all citizen petitions filed, the percentage of petitions with the possibility of delaying generic entry doubled since 2003, rising from 10 percent to 20 percent. Thus, in some years, one in five petitions filed at the FDA on any topic, including tobacco, food and dietary supplements, had the potential to delay generic competition.\u000a\u000aMoreover, we found that 40 percent of such petitions were filed a year or less before the FDA approved the generic, indicating that companies are using these petitions as a last-ditch effort to hold off competition.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of other games to play, as well. For example, generic applicants need samples of the brand-name drug to show the FDA that their version is equivalent; some brand-name companies flatly refused to sell samples to generic companies.\u000a\u000aAnother common tactic involves making tiny modifications to the dosage or formulation of a drug just as the original patents are about to expire. This strategy, known as \u201cproduct hopping,\u201d allows the drug company to obtain a brand-new set of patents on their \u201cnew and improved\u201d version of the drug.\u000a\u000aEven if the patents are overturned \u2013 and studies show that generics convince courts to overturn the majority of patents they challenge \u2013 the process again takes time.\u000a\u000aMuch of the attention is focused on patents, but the 13 regulatory exclusivities that the FDA doles out also help create competition-free zones. These offer months or even years of additional protection, by taking steps such as carrying out pediatric studies or developing drugs for rare diseases termed \u201corphan drugs.\u201d Drug companies have stretched these systems to the point at which the costs to society far outweigh the benefits.\u000a\u000aThe crippling cost of medicine\u000a\u000aOne can understand the motivation \u2013 delaying entry of a generic competitor for even a few months can translate into billions of dollars in extra revenue for the brand-name company. Thus, drug companies string out games that obstruct and delay competition, one after another. As I noted when testifying before Congress about such strategies, \u201cA billion here, a billion there; that adds up to real money.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2015, 80 percent of the profit growth of the 20 largest drug companies resulted from price hikes. And drugs are vastly more expensive in the U.S. than abroad. (The liver failure drug Syprine, for example, sells for less than $400 a year in many countries; in the U.S., the average list price is US$300,000. Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, reportedly sells for the equivalent of $1,000 abroad \u2013 in the U.S., it sells for $84,000.)\u000a\u000aThe industry can do this, in part, because unlike the demand for other goods, the demand for pharmaceuticals is highly inelastic. Consumers will continue to pay for the drugs that can save their lives, even if it breaks the bank.\u000a\u000aThe impact on addiction treatment\u000a\u000aNowhere is the pain of these games more troubling than in the market for opioid addiction medicine.\u000a\u000aIn September, I testified before a House Judiciary Subcommittee at a hearing about the state of competition in the markets for addiction medicine, noting that, while \u201cOpen and vigorous competition is the backbone of U.S. markets\u2026we are not seeing that in the market for addiction medicine.\u201d\u000a\u000aPharmaceutical companies often argue that high profits are needed to fund development of new drugs, some of which don\u2019t make it to market.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe competitive market is structured to take maximum advantage of savings from brand competition,\u201d testified Anne McDonald Pritchett, vice president, policy and research for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\u000a\u000aHowever, open and vigorous competition is certainly not what the manufacturer behind the addiction treatment drug Suboxone had in mind when it combined several games to fight off generics appearing on the horizon. These games included product hopping (shifting the market to a new form of the drug just as the exclusivity expires so pharmacists cannot fill the prescription with a generic), refusing to cooperate with generic companies on safety plans, and petitioning the FDA to impose safety measures on generic versions that were never required for the brand-name version.\u000a\u000aThe opioid addiction epidemic is a complex problem, and there are no simple answers. One thing, however, is certain. The U.S. system should not reward companies for blocking generic competition. When we do that, the American public pays the price.\u000a\u000aRobin Feldman is a Professor of Intellectual Property at the University of California, Hastings.

aVTo date, actress Sarah Paulson has worked with uber-producer and showrunner Ryan Murphy on a whopping nine seasons of television and the two of them will soon make it ten. Deadline reports that Paulson has signed on to star in the third season of Murphy\u2019s anthology series American Crime Story: Katrina for FX. Paulson recently starred in the show\u2019s inaugural season as prosecutor Marcia Clark as she tackled the O.J. Simpson trial.\u000a\u000aKatrina has hit a few creative speed bumps during its development (the show\u2019s second season has yet to even premiere, so no rush) before pivoting to adapt Sheri Fink\u2019s book Five Days at Memorial. That story revolves around the chaos at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Paulson will play Dr. Anna Pou, who helped euthanize critical patients as they were trapped in the hospital for days without power. Pairing arguably television\u2019s most compelling leading lady with this kind of morally ambiguous material should make for some captivating television.\u000a\u000aFilm producer Scott Rudin originally held the rights to Five Days at Memorial and was planning to turn it into a movie, according to Deadline.

FX is now hoping to recast the trio in new roles for Katrina\u2018s new direction.\u000a\u000aSeason 2 of the anthology drama\u2014The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u2014will premiere in January 2018. Katrina is expected to debut in early 2019.

It\u2019s a wave we noted last year. But over the last 12 months, the blurred lines have continued transforming the business in ways that are surprising even industry veterans. \u201cClients aren\u2019t choosing specializations anymore,\u201d said Salzman, whose company now brings in just a third of revenue from conventional media relations. \u201cThey\u2019re choosing people.\u201d\u000a\u000aNelson Fernandez, North American chairman of APCO Worldwide and its managing director in New York, agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a convergence between PR, advertising and digital. It\u2019s channel-agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who understands how to get inside people\u2019s heads. We\u2019re the ones who can read trends in how people are connecting, behaving and communicating. And if we keep doing that, I think we\u2019ll continue to be a very important\u2014perhaps the most important\u2014part of the marketing mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgencies are even moving away from describing themselves as PR firms. \u201cWe are content providers and distributors. Media relations no longer defines what we do,\u201d said Florence Quinn, founder of Quinn, the travel and lifestyle powerhouse. \u201cWe create strong ideas that resonate with people and the media. This is incredibly exciting because there are a gajillion ways to produce content and even more ways to distribute it. The line between earned and paid media has been crossed forever; there is no going back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt firms like Sunshine Sachs, whose clients range from A-list celebs (Lin-Manuel Miranda to blue-chip nonprofits (Human Rights Campaign) to corporations like Facebook, the transformation\u2019s been even more radical. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 35 people who don\u2019t do traditional communications,\u201d said Shawn Sachs, the firm\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty significant for a firm with about 160 people. We hired our second art director this year. If you\u2019d said that 10 years ago, people would have thought you were crazy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the broadest sense, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re a communications company. But we\u2019re also an advertising company, a marketing company, a digital company, an events company, an idea company. We\u2019re a lot of things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe upheaval in media has also transformed what clients need, said Cindi Berger, chairman and CEO of entertainment and marketing giant PMK*BNC\u2014and agencies like hers have benefited.\u000a\u000a\u201cSharing and providing content\u2014that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Berger said. \u201cOur ability is to really craft a narrative for a specific client, pursue media for that client, work with influencers and generate partnerships, whether they\u2019re brand related or fan-related. Fans are partners too. Our job is to make sure fans download the book, buy the record or use a provider we\u2019re working with.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut don\u2019t give up on traditional PR just yet, said Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick, where more than two-thirds of growth is coming from digital, social and content-marketing arm Mediaco. \u201cWe call ourselves an engagement firm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, it\u2019s a mistake to decide you\u2019re no longer in the public relations business. If you think about changes in the media world, and the impact earned media still has, PR continues to be absolutely critical. Sure, we\u2019ve evolved as a firm. But we\u2019re proud of our heritage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd while creative destruction hasn\u2019t been great for media, it\u2019s keeping PR mavens buoyantly optimistic (and well compensated\u2014according to The Holmes Report, the global PR industry grossed $14.2 billion in 2015).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in the message business,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cAnd our business is as exciting and interesting as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: New York\u2019s Top Specialty PR Agencies\u000a\u000aA word about the PR Power 50 list:\u000a\u000aRather than rely on revenue or size as criteria for our rankings, the Observer considers subjective factors. What kind of year did a firm have? Did it hire superstars? Has it won covetable clients? Does it feel like the agency\u2019s got momentum and juice? Did it avoid serious screw-ups\u2014or at least keep its screw-ups out of view? And, of course, did its people return our calls and emails?\u000a\u000aEvery one of the 50 firms we\u2019ve chosen pushed those buttons, but our agency of the year for 2016 boasted an especially stellar performance. We\u2019re eager to hear what you think about where the industry\u2019s been this year\u2014and where it\u2019s going in 2017 and beyond.

aVWhen President Donald Trump said that if North Korea continued to escalate the crisis \u201cThey will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power, the likes of which the world has never seen,\u201d he singlehandedly resurrected an old nuclear war strategy known as \u201cbrinkmanship,\u201d a policy from the 1950s that was buried after the Cuban Missile Crisis.\u000a\u000aAccording to Emily Tamkin with Foreign Policy Magazine, Trump issued the threat to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in response to reports that the East Asian country has generated a small nuclear warhead that can be attached to a long-range missile. Tamkin writes, \u201cNow Trump\u2014who famously waxed poetic over the destructive power of \u2018nuclear\u2019 during the presidential campaign\u2014has clearly threatened a nuclear-armed rival with unprecedented fire and fury.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Kevin Drum with Mother Jones writes, brinkmanship (also known as \u201cbrinksmanship\u201d) is connected with the strategy of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State to Dwight D. Eisenhower. Dulles stated his tactics in an interview with Time-Life in the mid-1950s: \u201cThe ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art. If you cannot master it, you inevitably get into war. If you try to run away from it, if you are scared to go to the brink, you are lost.\u201d\u000a\u000aDulles\u2019 policy was lambasted by Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson in the 1956 campaign, who claimed Eisenhower\u2019s advisor was \u201cboasting of his brinkmanship\u2026.the art of bringing us to the edge of the nuclear abyss.\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch talk may have seemed quaint just a few years ago. My students shake their heads at videos I show of students cowering under desks and laugh at the \u201cBert the Turtle\u201d public service announcement training people to \u201cduck and cover.\u201d The only air raid sirens they\u2019ve ever heard are for tornadoes. Unless they\u2019ve taken my courses, the Cuban Missile Crisis is just a conclusion to an X-Men movie for most.\u000a\u000aBut brinkmanship was real, as those from older generations will attest. This policy was used to defend West Berlin, a tiny pair of islands (Quemoy and Matsu) near Taiwan, and yes, South Korea.\u000a\u000aHow real were these crises? Did we really intend to use nukes, or was it all a big bluff? An article in Presidential Studies Quarterly by Michael Gordon Jackson, a lecturer of political science at Brown University, found that when Eisenhower and his advisers employed brinkmanship against North Korea and China, he wasn\u2019t engaging in empty threats. He viewed them as employable in war\u2014not just something to frighten opponents. Eisenhower was prepared to go the distance to defend our allies in Asia.\u000a\u000aPerhaps that\u2019s why we abandoned the policy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. As Richard M. Pious (the Chair of Political Science at Barnard College and author of The American Presidency) wrote in Political Science Quarterly, \u201cJohn F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev almost blundered into a nuclear war through the crisis management approaches of their advisory systems, but then managed to extricate themselves using personal diplomacy and old-fashioned political horsetrading in secret.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is reminiscent of the 1950s. But should we bring back our nuclear policies from that era as well?\u000a\u000aToday, many in the executive branch oppose this brinkmanship policy being used by our president. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson rushed to defuse the situation. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis warned of the consequences of nuclear war with North Korea\u2014for us and them.\u000a\u000aTo judge whether such threats could be effective or not, it is worth examining the nuclear crises of the 1950s and early 1960s. Brinkmanship defenders could claim that West Berlin, Quemoy and Matsu, and our allies in the Suez Canal crisis (Britain, France and Israel) were never attacked with nuclear weapons. But detractors can point out that such saber-rattling pushed us closer to World War III and annihilation, which is why the policy was abandoned after the Cuban Missile Crisis. It remains to be seen whether resurrecting it is a good idea.\u000a\u000aJohn A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga.

aVSugar Sammy is a comedian, actor, writer and producer from Montreal. He tours internationally, in English, French, Punjabi and Hindi. He mainly performs stand-up comedy but boasts a large body of work, including three one-man shows, an original TV series on Canada\u2019s French V network and an HBO Canada special (the first of it\u2019s kind). He\u2019s performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal seven years in a row and in his four fluent languages. The Observer sat down with Sammy to discuss his impressive body of work and the unique style he\u2019s developed by performing in such diverse cultural landscapes. Sammy will be headlining Caroline\u2019s Comedy Club in New York City July 13, 14 and 15.\u000a\u000aYou were just in Austin, which leads me to my first question: I know you\u2019re on sort of a U.S. run right now, how\u2019s it been treating you?\u000a\u000aGreat, it\u2019s been fun to discover how different the U.S. is from state to state, from city to city, how different their points of view are, their politics, their demographics, religious beliefs, it changes depending on what area of the country you\u2019re in. You know, one of the things they say about America right now is that it\u2019s so divided. I mean, America is also so diverse in terms of its composition, but the diversity doesn\u2019t melt together. It\u2019s diversity by region, it\u2019s weird.\u000a\u000aYeah, it\u2019s kind of atomized in a weird way, especially right now, but it makes sense that you would notice that as someone who speaks four different languages, tours internationally and things like that. How do you find yourself adjusting your material when you travel?\u000a\u000aThe material is the same, what changes is the reactions. But a lot of times I\u2019m surprised, I was just in Naples, Florida, which is one of the highest populations of Trump voters. I was bringing my material there, coming from a Canadian perspective, and I was really surprised because these people were losing their minds laughing at this material where I was nervous going in there, I was like, \u201cI know it\u2019ll work in Seattle, I know it\u2019ll work in San Jose, I know it\u2019ll work in different places, but I was completely surprised by how well it worked there.\u000a\u000aDid you book Naples for that reason?\u000a\u000aI booked Naples because they wanted to book me. A lot of snowbirds\u2014a lot of Canadians\u2014go there for the winter, so they\u2019ve been bugging the comedy clubs to book me there. I was also insisting on doing it because I wanted to test the material democratically everywhere.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s one thing about road comics\u2014you don\u2019t get into bubbles a lot of the time. You\u2019re not just talking to your own people. Did a lot of Canadians come see you?\u000a\u000aA lot, but also social media gets a lot of people in. Also I used to tour the states, I used to headline the states a lot from around 2009 to 2011, whereas currently I\u2019m spending a lot of time in Canada and Europe, so I have a lot of fans here that it\u2019s been good to get back to, to say I\u2019m back.\u000a\u000aTell me about that. When you perform in France, and you perform in other languages, do you find that comedy works differently in other languages\u2014or is it more of a cultural thing?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s more of a cultural thing, that\u2019s so interesting, you\u2019re the first person that\u2019s asked that question. It\u2019s not a linguistic thing. Linguistically, you have to adjust a little bit in that you have to make sure you get to the punchline as quickly as possible, but the material stays the same and the structure stays the same, you just gotta find that bridge between the language and the way it works because it was constructed in English, but it works in other languages. I\u2019ve done it French, Hindi and Punjabi, and you just gotta find the cultural material that connects to that audience. Linguistically, if I had a French or Indian audience in New York, I\u2019d do the same material I do about the states, but I\u2019d do it in French, and it still works.\u000a\u000aA lot of people will say that with something like, let\u2019s say, hip-hop, that it only works in English style rhyme scheming or something.\u000a\u000aHip-hop is more beautiful in French! You gotta check out this rapper, he\u2019s a legend in France, he\u2019s called MC Solaar, in French his stuff flows better. And similarly France is now starting to have the stand up tradition. I think the difference was for years they\u2019d have these one-man shows where they\u2019d be doing characters and their mom and their uncle and stuff like that, like what you guys would call an Off-Broadway show or whatever, but in the last five years we\u2019ve seen these stand ups come out. And it\u2019s the art form that becomes the norm. Five years ago when they were doing these one man shows they\u2019d ask me, \u201cWould your material work there?\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople who\u2019ve done Edinburgh say it\u2019s like that a lot of the time. They\u2019d do these tight New York one-liners, and people just didn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u000a\u000aYeah, but you just gotta do what you do best. You can break through with them a lot; that\u2019s the art form\u2014it\u2019s more conversational. And even if it\u2019s a cultural shock for a second, you can get through to them. It doesn\u2019t feel like this guy\u2019s just doing this schtick up there where he doesn\u2019t acknowledge us and he\u2019s just doing the same stuff every night. There\u2019s all these improvisational elements going on. It\u2019s a lot like jazz in that they\u2019d do five or six shows a weekend and record all of them and then pick the one they liked the best, because it\u2019s not gonna be the same show, it changes depending on the audience. And there\u2019s that dance with the audience that\u2019s the important part, they\u2019re listening to us as much as we\u2019re listening to them.\u000a\u000aYour material is very crowd-work heavy and that makes a lot of sense. Somebody once told me the audience is like an instrument and when you\u2019re doing crowd work you\u2019re like jamming, you know?\u000a\u000aYeah! That\u2019s so true.\u000a\u000aSo where\u2019d that style come from? I\u2019ve noticed with crowd work and people that are really good at it, they work in clubs a lot, like proper comedy clubs where the audience is people that are on dates as opposed to audiences in bars or what have you. You came up in Canada right?\u000a\u000aI came up in Canada but I toured everywhere, but I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of our headliners in Canada and England are really good at crowd work because we value the emcee role a lot, so what happens is, a lot of headliners, when they have a weekend off, they host. And it\u2019s valued and paid the same as headlining because it\u2019s treated like the most important role in that show, Whereas here it\u2019s different, the hierarchy and pay is different. In England it\u2019s always been a five-man show where there\u2019s four headliners doing 20 minutes apiece and an emcee, and everyone gets paid evenly, and you\u2019ll see headliners emcee very easily.\u000a\u000aSo did you do a lot of that?\u000a\u000aI did a lot of that, and so you develop that skill very easily, and I just find it becomes a very fun part of the show. I\u2019ll have my material but I like going and using the crowd and talking to them, who knows, something might happen, or I\u2019ll bounce ideas for a new bit off of them. And also, I\u2019ll tape every show and the best crowd work, I\u2019ll use that as promotional material, because you don\u2019t want to burn your actual material you know? It\u2019s not like music where they want to hear the same joke over and over. So it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving them a part of the show without burning any of the show.\u000a\u000aDo you find that when you travel, are you trying to bring what you do to those new places or are you adjusting to how they respond?\u000a\u000aI think a bit of both, I bring what I do, but I make it about them. Like you said about being an anthropologist, like when I go to France I notice these little tiny things that are commonplace for them and then I point them out and it becomes funny because they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s right it\u2019s funny, but we never talk about it,\u201d but I also talk about myself and the Canadians point of view and how we\u2019re different. And you can\u2019t be a caricature, you can\u2019t do it from afar, you gotta be immersed in it. It\u2019s happening as I\u2019m in New York right now, I\u2019m noticing these things.\u000a\u000aHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been in New York?\u000a\u000aI was here last month, at the French Comedy Festival. I hosted one gala in English. It was all French comedians doing comedy in English for the first time and a few Americans, and then I played my show in French for a half-French crowd and a half-Québécois crowd, and I like that; I like it when I have to switch languages and switch cultures because it keeps your brain sharp\u2014you\u2019re always working, you\u2019re never on autopilot.\u000a\u000aYeah, you definitely have to keep yourself in the moment so you don\u2019t become a robot.\u000a\u000aYeah, and that\u2019s the danger, that\u2019s why I like the crowd work, and that\u2019s why I like moving around. You know, I was touring Quebec for five years, and I was having a great time, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was growing as a writer, as soon as I flew into France my writer brain went crazy. I would be up all night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019d be having to write all this stuff down. I feel like you have to get out of your comfort zone, which is why I like going to other countries so much.\u000a\u000aPeople say that about writer\u2019s block, that you have to shake things up, but then the question is always, How? That seems like a really good answer. Man, this is fun. I feel like I could pick your brain all day. We could do a full Maron episode right now, but I\u2019ve got to let you go. So, to round things out, let\u2019s talk about your career. You\u2019ve accomplished quite a bit: What\u2019s next? Tell me about the future.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s always about doing more, doing something different. For me it\u2019s never been about all that other stuff, It\u2019s always been about being able to get up, write, work on stuff, be on stage every night if I can. Once I started getting really famous in Canada I left for a while because I was like, If I enjoy this too much, I\u2019ll get lazy, and then I\u2019m just thinking about not losing what I have, and if you write when you have a lot to lose, I find it\u2019s never gonna be as good as when you write when you have nothing to lose. So I\u2019ll go to a fresh new market where I have nothing to lose and push myself as far as I want, and if it doesn\u2019t work, I can always go home later, you know? The best thing is having that freedom, being able to create the work I want to create.

aVThere's a castle for sale in Westchester. Scroll through to see it in its current form.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf anyone is in desperate need of a castle right now, there happens to be one just an hour outside of New York\u2014and it\u2019s on the market right now.\u000a\u000aThe 4,337-square-foot castle in Westchester isn\u2019t royal-ready just yet; it\u2019s currently in a less regal state of total disrepair. But, it is still a castle. It\u2019s actually the Abercrombie Castle, named so because David T. Abercrombie, the co-founder of the brand, built it.\u000a\u000aAbercrombie and his wife, Lucy Abbott Cate, designed the residence at 247 Croton Dam Road in 1927, and named it Elda Castle in honor of their four children; they used the first initials of each of their names, Elizabeth, Lucy, David and Abbott. In fact, Cate was an architect herself, so she had a big role in the process.\u000a\u000aThe four-bedroom, five-bathroom castle is \u201cin need of total renovation,\u201d admits the $3.69 million listing, held by Sotheby\u2019s International Realty broker Christina DiMinno. There are two floors of living space, and there are still features like an open patio with a fireplace and a cast iron, spiral staircase that leads to the tower. And yes, there is a tower, because this is a castle we\u2019re talking about.\u000a\u000aThe listing says the home is in Ossining, but it seems it\u2019s actually (and quite fittingly) located in New Castle. There\u2019s also a barn on the 49.6-acre property, which is also in need of a renovation.\u000a\u000aThe house once had 25 rooms, arched doorways and was, well, actually livable. But after Abercrombie passed away, Cate went to live with one of her daughters in New Jersey, until Cate died in 1955. And sadly for Elda Castle, it\u2019s been mostly vacant for quite some time, with a few intermittent periods where someone actually lived there\u2014it has changed ownership a number of times. At present, the home is reportedly owned by the Morgan Immovable Trust, an entity which purchased the estate for $3.75 million in 2011.\u000a\u000aThere has also been serious damage as a result of vandalism, including fires and paint poured onto the marble floors, per Town & Country.\u000a\u000aApparently, local vandals have been at it with the house for quite some time\u2014burning the roof, setting fire to the content inside the house and generally making the owners miserable. But perhaps the home just needs the right person to return it to its former glory. It might not be quite ready for Kate Middleton and Prince William just yet, but after a few renovations, you know know.

aVIn December 2016, Warner Bros.\u2019 Aquaman was pushed back several months to a fall release date. Then, in March of this year, the movie was again pushed back until December. Given the highly publicized trouble Warner Bros. has had with its DC Extended Universe, fans took these repeated delays to mean that the film was in dire straits and that another disappointing effort was forthcoming. But since then, Wonder Woman has righted the ship to save the DCEU and some optimism has returned to the franchise.\u000a\u000aRather than story issues or drama behind the scenes, the most likely reason Aquaman hasn\u2019t enjoyed smooth sailing (apologize in advance for any and all nautical puns in this article) is that it\u2019s really difficult to shoot an entire film underwater.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a very technically challenging shoot to be on,\u201d director James Wan (Furious 7, The Conjuring) told THR. \u201cWorking with water, and even the dry-for-wet sequences are very complex\u2026Our equivalent of two people sitting around chatting in the underwater world is super complicated. You have to think about CG with the hair, and how their clothing moves, how are they floating, what kind of rig we put them on and all that stuff.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis monumental under(water)taking is made all the more stressful by Wan\u2019s admirable emphasis on using real actors and avoiding an over-reliance on CGI. He doesn\u2019t want to fall into the same Star Wars prequels trap.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat just makes it very difficult and time-sucking and time-challenging to do all of this,\u201d Wan explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s not an easy shoot\u2014but hopefully it will pay off in spades down the line.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo perhaps we were all a bit quick to dive in and declare Aquaman a sunken cost. If November\u2019s Justice League can join Wonder Woman as a critical and commercial success, then the DCEU will have course correct itself without doing too much long-term damage. For what it\u2019s worth, Wan is happy to see fans get behind the franchise recently.\u000a\u000a\u201cPositivity in any way is always a good thing,\u201d Wan said. \u201cSo yeah, I think it\u2019s great. I think when people are happy and excited, it helps the overall cause, you know?\u201d\u000a\u000aAquaman will hit theaters on December 21, 2018.

aVPhil Murphy picked up an endorsement from Planned Parenthood on Thursday, pledging not only to restore reproductive health care funding cut by Gov. Chris Christie but to increase it.\u000a\u000aThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund endorsed Murphy, the Democratic nominee for governor, and legislative candidates at a rally on the steps of the Trenton War Memorial. With the state house as a back drop, speakers criticized Christie for cutting the state\u2019s yearly appropriation to Planned Parenthood since 2010. Murphy said he would restore and potentially increase the $7.5 million per year if elected.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe not only stand and stand proudly that we will reinstate the $7.5 million, but I want to shoot higher,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do better than that. Particularly, in the face of a hostile federal administration. So it\u2019s not just about getting things back to par and getting things back to where they were. It\u2019s about reaching beyond that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter the rally, Murphy said he didn\u2019t have an exact figure of how much he\u2019d like to see spent on Planned Parenthood. But he noted restoring the $7.5 million would make up a modest sum in the state budget, which is $34.6 billion this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think on something like this New Jersey should be nothing less than best in the nation,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMost New Jersey voters support federal and state funding to low-cost women\u2019s health centers including Planned Parenthood, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in June. Nearly 78 percent of voters surveyed said they support health care funding for lower-income women, 84 percent said Medicaid should continue funding Planned Parenthood and 53 percent said insurance should fully cover the cost of birth control, the poll found.\u000a\u000aMurphy described the issue of women\u2019s health care as \u201cmission critical\u201d and \u201cliterally life and death,\u201d claiming women have died due to Christie\u2019s cuts to Planned Parenthood. He sought to tie the cuts to his Republican gubernatorial rival, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.\u000a\u000a\u201cWomen are dying in this state thanks to the cuts that the governor and the lieutenant governor have endorsed now for seven and a half years,\u201d he charged. \u201cThey\u2019ve put a lot of women at risk in this state over seven and a half years. I think it\u2019s deplorable. It\u2019s unacceptable. And it will stop.\u201d\u000a\u000aMurphy said he didn\u2019t have statistics to prove this on hand, but said data show a clear correlation between the cuts and sexually transmitted diseases in women.\u000a\u000aAlthough Christie has taken much heat over the years for cutting the $7.5 million for women\u2019s health centers, he said last month that overall, \u201cwe fund, now at a greater level than ever before, health care for women.\u201d The administration has continued to provide money for federally qualified health centers, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have signed legislation requiring insurance companies to cover breast exams and other testing, and I recently signed legislation expanding infertility coverage for all women in New Jersey,\u201d Christie added in a conditional veto message agreeing to increase birth control prescription allotments from three months to six months in the state.\u000a\u000aChristine Sadovy, political director for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey, said the upcoming election was not only about the state, but setting an example for the rest of the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can and will be a beacon of hope for the rest of the nation. We can and will show the country that New Jersey will not back down from attacks on women\u2019s rights and access to reproductive health care,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can and will elect a governor who shares the Planned Parenthood belief that access to health care should not depend on who you are, where you live or how much money you make.\u201d

aVRichard Gerstl (1883-1908), a prodigy from a rich Austrian family, took his own life at the age of 25 more than a century ago. Prolific for his young age, he often painted landscapes and the people around him. But most of all, he painted himself.\u000a\u000aThere are 10 self-portraits in Gerstl\u2019s first exhibition in the United States, which runs at the Neue Galerie through September 25. The gaunt face on the catalog\u2019s cover, Self Portrait, Laughing, painted when Gerstl was 23, shows him with his mouth agape, as a light that seems to come from a fire illuminates from below. His hair is cropped short, like a convict\u2019s. The light brown flecks on the abstract background could be the scratched wall of a prison cell. It\u2019s an eerie, haunting image. Something\u2019s not right.\u000a\u000aAnd something wasn\u2019t right. Gerstl killed himself just after he turned 25, stabbing himself after he had placed a rope around his neck\u2014a shocking image, even by Gerstl\u2019s standards. Van Gogh, a mighty self-portraitist, would die at 37, Seurat at 36, Schiele at 28.\u000a\u000aDuring his brief lifetime, Gerstl never exhibited a painting and never sold one. His pictures were more somber and penetrating than those of the decorously successful Gustav Klimt. By the time of Gerstl\u2019s death in 1908, Egon Schiele, at 18, was a promising talent, but not yet an enfant terrible.\u000a\u000aNo one knew what happened to Gerstl\u2019s work after his suicide, until one of his brothers took all the pictures he left behind to a dealer in Vienna in 1931. Austria and other European countries would become aware of Gerstl\u2019s rare talent before World War II. In this country, the process has taken longer. We know of some 90 works by Gerstl. The Neue Galerie is showing more than 50. This exhibition is the rare chance to see some remarkable work.\u000a\u000aToday\u2019s audience can\u2019t help but think of Gerstl\u2019s relentless self-portraiture as a precursor of the selfie syndrome. For Gerstl, it was and it wasn\u2019t. The young man had the facility and the urgency to depict himself again and again, working in and out of styles that reflected what was out there in the art world, and what emerged from his mysterious self. But it was Vienna, and he didn\u2019t send them around to all his friends.\u000a\u000aAnd this wasn\u2019t automatic Instagram self-documentation. As you look at Gerstl\u2019s pictures of himself, sometimes composed in pointillist dots that seem borrowed from Georges Seurat, sometimes in unruly crossed lines that prefigure the work of Alberto Giacometti, you feel Gerstl\u2019s process of self-exploration unfolding. Assimilating and overtaking the revolutionary styles of his time was achievable for Gerstl. Less achievable, since his way of depicting himself was constantly in flux, was containing himself in a single likeness. Expressed in the clichés of art criticism\u2014the form was easy for this young talent, and content was the hard part. The mix of drama and mystery keep us looking today\u000a\u000aAnd there\u2019s more to Gerstl\u2019s back story. At 23 he was hired by the composer Arnold Schönberg to teachSchönberg and his wife, Mathilde, how to paint. Schönberg, who struggled to find an audience for his atonal music, thought that painting would be a way for to make a living. It wouldn\u2019t be. Gerstl and Mathilde, who was six years older, began an affair.\u000a\u000aThe Gerstl-Schönberg encounters led to portraits of Arnold and Mathilde, and to Schönberg family portraits, and to thick applications of paint on the canvas that blur faces as they compose them, making you think of what Abstract Expressionist masters like Willem de Kooning would do decades later.\u000a\u000aIn Seated Female Nude, a portrait of Mathilde that Gerstl painted in 1906\u2014a year before Pablo Picasso completed Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u2014the faint, nearly indiscernible features of Mathilde\u2019s face have a deadpan expression, and the outline of her body suggest an emptiness inside. Some say the painting is unfinished, and that Gerstl was waiting for it to dry before adding new layers of paint. We don\u2019t know, but Gerstl\u2019s vision of his lover here reminds you of figures by the American artist David Park from the 1950s. If Gerstl\u2019s self-portraits astound you with their defining elements, this picture strikes you with its chilling emptiness.\u000a\u000aThe show leaves you with another haunting figure, a self-portrait of Gerstl standing nude (with a full head of hair) that is likely the last work he painted before his suicide. In the full-frontal pose, probably painted in front of a mirror in his brother\u2019s bedroom, Gerstl is defying the father who would order it removed. Could it also be a signal to Schönberg, whose wife had returned to her husband by then? The defiant Gerstl would die with those secrets eight weeks later.\u000a\u000aYet there\u2019s something else, a portrait of Gerstl by another artist, the American William Clarke Rice, which shows the young painter in 1907 against a standard brown background. Gerstl\u2019s hair is short, as inSelf-Portrait Laughing, but he\u2019s groomed, and he\u2019s wearing a suit and bow-tie, like an aspiring accountant. The portrait is correct, yet the exhibition shows you the richness and darkness that it conceals.

aVThe media and tech community lost their collective mind over the weekend in response to a 10-page document written by a (since fired) employee at Google criticizing their political culture and diversity programs.\u000a\u000a(Before reading this article any further, please make sure you\u2019ve read the original memo. You can read the unedited version here.)\u000a\u000aHere are some words that major news and media outlets have used to describe it: \u201cscreed,\u201d \u201canti-diversity,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chate speech.\u201d They\u2019ve called the author out for bigotry and sexual harassment. They\u2019ve lambasted him for encouraging the worst parts of tech culture. If you went into the document having only read the headlines and opinions on Twitter, you might assume it was watermarked with a Nazi flag and filled with racial slurs, overt sexism, and hate speech.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, Google fired him over it.\u000a\u000aBut if you truly read it, you\u2019ll be surprised to find that it\u2019s none of these things. It\u2019s an unpopular, non-politically-correct opinion\u2026but it\u2019s far from aggressive, offensive, or sexist.\u000a\u000aWhat media outlets and critics (and perhaps even Google) won\u2019t admit is that the memo is well-reasoned, calmly written, and backed by research (which I\u2019ve included below). This engineer isn\u2019t calling for an end to diversity programs or an all-powerful white-male patriarchy, but rather a rethinking of how they approach diversity hiring.\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s not even the main point of the memo. What he is primarily saying is that huge numbers of people at Google feel like they can\u2019t speak openly. That the culture stifles intellectual diversity in a company that claims to be open to any and all views. That opinions contrary to the vocal left have been silenced through shame and outrage.\u000a\u000aPerhaps somewhat predictably, the response has proven his point. The emotional outrage we\u2019ve seen, especially from media outlets, in response to the document\u2019s mere existence shows how true its main thesis is. Viewpoints that make us uncomfortable have been vilified and punished, regardless of their scientific accuracy. Holders of those viewpoints have to silence themselves for fear of public humiliation or worse, so much so that this memo had to be published anonymously. And now that he\u2019s been fired, you can imagine other Google employees will hesitate to share unpopular opinions.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll come back to that main problem, but let\u2019s dig into the memo\u2019s arguments about gender differences first: Is there any weight to what the document had to say?\u000a\u000aAre There Differences in Interests between Men and Women?\u000a\u000aThe author summarizes the main arguments of the memo as:\u000a\u000a\u201cGoogle\u2019s political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety, but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.\u000a\u000aThis silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed.\u000a\u000aThe lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology.\u000a\u000aExtreme: all disparities in representation are due to oppression\u000a\u000aAuthoritarian: we should discriminate to correct for this oppression\u000a\u000aDifferences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don\u2019t have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.\u201d\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s put their argument more simply: men and women are different; those differences might explain part of why we don\u2019t have 50/50 representation of men and women in tech and leadership, just as we don\u2019t have a 50/50 representation in oil drilling and primary education. But that opinion has been \u201cshamed into silence\u201d because Google is afraid that discussing differences between men and women may upset some people. Since employees can\u2019t express opinions that might upset people out of fear of shame or firing, the most extreme and authoritarian elements of the ideology have taken hold and go unquestioned.\u000a\u000aThe author\u2019s point, at least related to gender and diversity, is that if there\u2019s truth to general differences of interests between men and women impacting career choice, then diversity programs that try to create a perfect 50/50 split will be discriminatory against whatever gender is more interested in the field. On top of that, they\u2019ll be bad for business, since you\u2019ll have to force in less-qualified candidates to check off the diversity box.\u000a\u000aThis is all that the document is arguing about gender differences. Nowhere does it suggest that women are unqualified for engineering work, or that there shouldn\u2019t be diversity programs. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been widely misrepresented this way (which, again, is why you have to read the memo for yourself).\u000a\u000aAbout those differences in interests, though.\u000a\u000aWe can agree that, on average, men and women are physically different. Where people get uncomfortable and push back is when you suggest that men and women have mental differences. And since I know I need to keep harping on this throughout the article, different does not mean better or worse. If one person is more music oriented and one person is more writing oriented, the musician isn\u2019t better, they\u2019re just different. Pointing out differences is not offensive nor does the existence of difference imply superiority one way or the other.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s look at the points made in the memo about the mental differences between men and women. They argue:\u000a\u000aWomen on average have more openness towards feelings and aesthetics over ideas.\u000a\u000aWomen on average show a higher interest in people while men show more interest in things.\u000a\u000aWomen on average are more cooperative.\u000a\u000aWomen on average are more neurotic.\u000a\u000aWomen on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average.\u000a\u000aBecause these are the arguments in the article that have attracted the most fury, it\u2019s worth assessing each one more closely:\u000a\u000a#1: Women on average have more openness towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas\u000a\u000aThis point is a tad confusing, but the author seems to be arguing that within the Big Five trait of Openness, women tend more towards feelings and aesthetics, and men tend more towards ideas.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s research to back up women having more empathetic ability and empathy towards fairness, but it\u2019s unclear if that means that they have more interest in feelings and aesthetics. Women do fall, on average, more on the \u201cempathizing\u201d side of the Empathizing-Systematizing scale though.\u000a\u000aThe point, though, is perhaps better explained by the author\u2019s next argument:\u000a\u000a#2: Women on average show a higher interest in people while men show more interest in things\u000a\u000aThis is referencing Richard Lippa\u2019s research on \u201cGender Differences in Personality and Interests.\u201d Particularly, this part:\u000a\u000a\u201cMen tend to be much more thing-oriented and much less people-oriented than women (mean d = 1.18, a \u2018very large\u2019 difference, according to Hyde (2005) verbal designations). The Su et al. (2009) meta-analysis generated the smallest effect size (d = 0.86). However, as Su et al. note in their paper, a number of the interest inventories that fed into their meta-analysis used item selection strategies intentionally designed to reduce gender differences.\u201d\u000a\u000aEssentially, there is a very strong correlation between men and being interest in things, as well as between women and being interested in people, even when you try to use non-gender-specific things.\u000a\u000aThis research also covers the next two arguments:\u000a\u000a#3: Women on average are more cooperative\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s referred to as agreeableness in the same analysis. The association is d=0.40, so it\u2019s not as strong as the people-things association, but still big.\u000a\u000a#4: Women on average are more neurotic\u000a\u000aTo be clear, \u201cneurotic\u201d here means higher in the Neuroticism trait, and shows up in that same study with a d of 0.34. This point seems particularly inflammatory, but the data don\u2019t lie. Across 37 nations women score higher than men on neuroticism:\u000a\u000a\u201cWomen obtained higher means than men on neuroticism in all countries, and men obtained higher means than women on psychoticism in 34 countries and on extraversion in 30 countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also been reproduced here, here, and here.\u000a\u000aThese data were also supported by a meta-analysis at the University of Illinois, where they concluded:\u000a\u000a\u201cResults showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d\u2afd0.93) on the Things\u2013People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d\u2afd0.84) and Investigative (d\u2afd0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d\u2afd\u2afa0.35), Social (d\u2afd\u2afa0.68), and Conventional (d\u2afd\u2afa0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d\u2afd1.11), science (d\u2afd0.36), and mathematics (d\u2afd0.34) interests.\u201d\u000a\u000a#5: Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average\u000a\u000aThis one is not so easy to reinforce, and I wish the links had been left in the original memo. I can\u2019t find anything directly supporting this argument, but here\u2019s what I can find:\u000a\u000aMen tend to be sexually judged on status and potential (1,2). Therefore, through sexual selection, men should care more about status as a signaling mechanism, and may care more about achieving status (leadership) in the workplace. LinkedIn and Citi did a study that found men and women care fairly equally about work-life balance, however a survey by LinkedIn and Crosstab found that more women care about work-life balance than a big paycheck. The author of the memo cites this study which does back up his point.\u000a\u000aThis position is less defensible, but I\u2019m also not sure it matters. All we need to do is establish that some psychological differences exist between men and women for the diversity discussion part of the memo to be relevant.\u000a\u000aAnd it appears that those differences do exist. If you take one man and one woman off the street and expect them to exhibit these differences, there will obviously be divergences. But the literature consistently indicates that, on average, there are psychological differences between men and women. These differences appear across cultures, and across ages. These differences can emerge as early as 9 months and are seen in our primate relatives. They even occur, as the author pointed out, in at least one case when a male was castrated and raised as a female. Males and females, on average, have different interests and psychological tendencies.\u000a\u000aNow, I feel like I need to pause here and point out that, again, interests are not the same as competency. The author of the Google memo is not saying that men are better at STEM related tasks, rather, that they might be more interested in them on average, a claim that, so far, the research supports, albeit a bit indirectly.\u000a\u000aBut the more important question we have to answer now is \u201cdoes it matter?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy These Differences Matter\u000a\u000aThe author is arguing that because these differences exist, there may be differences in job interest at the population level as a result of these biological trends. Therefore, trying to create a perfect 50/50 split may be misguided compared to other more effective changes.\u000a\u000aAssuming these differences do exist, as the research seems to indicate, it\u2019s easy to see how they could affect job choice. At the most basic level: If men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people, more women will be interested in more social jobs, while more men will be interested in more mechanical jobs.\u000a\u000aThis is all the document has said about differences between the sexes. They seem to exist, and they probably influence job preference. Therefore, these differences in interests and base rates should be considered when designing effective diversity programs. Since, at least in the entry level, Google engineering is more mechanical and less social (according to the memo and confirmed by Yonatan Zunger\u2019s response linked below[1]), this may make fewer women interested in going into engineering at Google.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s roughly what the author is saying. And when you look at it next to the research, he\u2019s not making an altogether backward argument. The author isn\u2019t arguing that Google should ditch diversity programs and have an all white-male company, rather, that they need to think more pragmatically about how to approach diversity.\u000a\u000aIf you try to hire at a level of diversity different from the base rate, you\u2019ll make sacrifices. When you have 80 women and 20 men applying for a role, taking 10 of each will necessarily lead to a weaker composition than taking 16 and 4. Hiring 16 women and 4 men is fair based on the rates of applications you\u2019re getting. 20 and 0 isn\u2019t fair, and neither is 10 and 10.\u000a\u000aIf men and women are, on average, interested in different things, we can\u2019t force people to change their interests, nor should we force fit them into roles because of a commitment to a series of numbers. Diversity isn\u2019t about math; it\u2019s about culture, effectiveness, structures, and fairness.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a great line from the document:\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, most reactions to the memo have been to do the opposite. To close our eyes, try to shield people who might be offended by it, and call for the author\u2019s public hanging.\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s the bigger problem here: How everyone, particularly the media and Google, reacted to the memo.\u000a\u000aThe Bigger Problem\u000a\u000aWhat struck me most about the document was how reasonable it was.\u000a\u000aIt was well written, well argued, objective. Its goal was more effective diversity and honest dialogue. They cited their sources. It wasn\u2019t rude. The goal of the document was to push Google to work on more effective diversity programs and to point out how inflammatory of an environment Google had become towards viewpoints that didn\u2019t conform with its left-leaning political culture.\u000a\u000aThe author opened the suggestions portion of the document by making this clear:\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn\u2019t try to correct for existing biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority. My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don\u2019t fit a certain ideology.\u201d (emphasis mine).\u000a\u000aIn reacting so violently to the document\u2019s existence, the media and Google have proven the article\u2019s point. As a society, we\u2019ve become so sensitive to potentially offensive topics that we discard and demonize them to the detriment of our own effectiveness.\u000a\u000aTo truly discredit a viewpoint, the solution is not to resort to ad-hominems, but to generously interpret the argument, lay out its premises, and show where it went wrong. But if you read through the articles criticizing the memo, they do not look at it holistically or give a reasoned counter-argument to the case made by the author. They resort to shame, claims of sexism, and the now-typical outrage we see against anyone who tries goes against what\u2019s politically correct.\u000a\u000aThis is where the response from Yonatan Zunger (a former senior Googler) went wrong. His first paragraph suggests that the memo says \u201cwe should stop trying to make it possible for women to be engineers, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d And then later, he says the memo argues that \u201csome large fraction of [the author\u2019s] colleagues are at root not good enough to do their jobs.\u201d Not only does the memo not make either of these points, but the memo goes directly against Zunger\u2019s mischaracterization, since the whole point of the memo is to suggest a more effective approach towards diversity.\u000a\u000aCharacterizing the arguments in this way only makes the echo-chamber problem worse. By misrepresenting the arguments and not trying to effectively refute them, Zunger has provided evidence that Google executives truly are intolerant of views that they disagree with. If you can\u2019t accurately interpret an argument before trying to refute it, and instead misinterpret it in the most offensive way possible, all you\u2019ve done is provide rage-bait to people who already agree with you.\u000a\u000aDanielle Brown, Google\u2019s VP of Diversity, doesn\u2019t do much better. She misrepresents the memo by suggesting it discusses \u201cability\u201d instead of \u201cinterest,\u201d and then slips in the line: \u201cAnd like many of you, I found that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I\u2019m not going to link to it here as it\u2019s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.\u201d She dismissed the arguments without providing any refutation to them, even though an (admittedly small) internal survey showed that around 35% of employees agree with the document to some extent.[2]\u000a\u000aEven Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has gotten this wrong, suggesting that the memo says \u201c\u2026a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to [engineering]\u2026\u201d It simply doesn\u2019t say that.\u000a\u000aGoogle employees are smart. If Zunger, Brown, and Pichai want to convince anyone internally, instead of just trying to look good for the media, they need to show where the document goes wrong while trying their best to fairly interpret the arguments. Anything less than that is propaganda, and confirms the underlying argument of the memo.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s worrisome that Google, one of the most powerful entities in the world, seems to be favoring feelings over objectivity when it was originally conceived as a tool to democratize access to information.\u000a\u000aThough many of us were force-marched through Fahrenheit 451 in high school, it\u2019s worth re-reading it now. Not only as a classic work of literature, but as a reasoned look at what happens when we choose fear of offense over truth. That\u2019s precisely how the society depicted in the novel got to the point of burning books in the first place:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must understand that our civilization is so vast that we can\u2019t have our minorities upset and stirred\u2026Coloured people don\u2019t like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don\u2019t feel good about Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Burn it. Someone\u2019s written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book.\u201d\u000a\u000aEmployees already fear voicing unpopular opinions because of what it might do to their private lives. Twitter is already shadow-banning accounts that they feel may be offensive. Is it such a stretch to imagine search results being censored because the information they contain might hurt someone\u2019s feelings?\u000a\u000aIf that happens, it\u2019ll be our fault. We won\u2019t descend into a world of censorship because a totalitarian government mandated it, or an omnipotent company decided it, but because we became so afraid of views contrary to our own that we demanded it.\u000a\u000a[1] Yonatan criticizes the argument that engineering roles favor male interests, but then he points out that at the junior level, this is true: \u201cSolitary work is something that only happens at the most junior levels\u2026\u201d While it seems that more senior engineers work in more social environments, if the entry-level roles are more mechnical, that could make them less appealing to women.\u000a\u000a[2] This is based on the charts from an internal survey which were leaked and can be found here.\u000a\u000aNat Eliason writes on his own site at nateliason.com, and you can find him on Twitter @nateliason.

aVIn today\u2019s market, it\u2019s not all together unusual for an artwork to surface at an auction and sell for thousands, even millions, more than what it was initially worth when it was first produced. Case in point, Pop artist Andy Warhol\u2019s famous \u201cBrillo Box\u201d sculpture, which is now the subject of a forthcoming HBO documentary, titled BRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) and premiering August 7, according to a press release.\u000a\u000aThe film traces the epic story of one of Warhol\u2019s original, signed Brillo Boxes, first bought in 1969 for $1,000 by newlywed art collectors Martin and Rita Skyler, and after an impressive, successive list of owners (including Gagosian gallery founding director Robert Shapazian and Charles Saatchi) the work was eventually sold at Christie\u2019s in 2010 for just over $3 million.\u000a\u000aHow could an artwork, seemingly simple in its construction and concept and lampooned by critics, accumulate so much in value over the span of forty years? Martin and Rita\u2019s daughter Lisanne, who has written, directed and produced the new film, seeks to find an answer by closely following the Brillo\u2019s Box\u2019s story, from its early years in her family\u2019s home to the stunningly 2010 sale at Christie\u2019s.\u000a\u000aSkyler\u2019s film captures reactions from her parents as they recall discovering the remarkable rise in value of the artwork they traded in 1971 in exchange for a piece by Peter Young, as well as expert analysis from Christie\u2019s chairman of the Americans Laura Paulson, Philadelphia Museum of Art curator Jessica Todd Smith, Warhol Museum former director Eric Shiner and critic and historian Irving Sandler, among others.\u000a\u000aBRILLO BOX (3¢ OFF) will premiere on HBO the day after what would have been Warhol\u2019s 89th birthday, at 10 p.m. ET.

aVAlex Israel is a youngish L.A. artist whose pastel-color panel paintings look like the sets of \u201980s porn flicks; they\u2019ve been selling like hotcakes at chic galleries in Paris and Berlin. I tried to see his recent one-man show at the übercool and cutting-edge Lower East Side gallery Reena Spaulings Fine Art, but the gallery is so übercool and cutting edge that, on the Friday afternoon I chose for my visit, it wasn\u2019t even open. In fact, the two times I have ventured to this gallery in an attempt to see an exhibition, during regular gallery hours, they have managed to have the doors locked and the lights turned off. I\u2019d given up on writing about Mr. Israel\u2019s work, when I realized that I could simply review his new TV show, As It LAys, the one he\u2019s recently uploaded to You Tube and for which he created a website: www.asitlays.com. This interview show, with Mr. Israel as host, reminds me of Andy Warhol\u2019s famous \u201cScreen Tests\u201d: both projects are, in superficially different but actually very similar ways, forms of video portraiture.\u000a\u000aThe so-called \u201cScreen Tests\u201d that Warhol made in the early \u201960s weren\u2019t really screen tests at all. Warhol shoved his camera in his subject\u2019s face and did a two-and-a-half-minute film. Whether it was a factory regular like Edie Sedgwick or Lou Reed, or some celebrity like Bob Dylan or Salvador Dalí, didn\u2019t really matter, because in the end all the subjects were just meat to grind in Warhol\u2019s lens, reminders that youth, beauty, sex, fame and fortune exist only in the moment.\u000a\u000aBefore As It LAys, Mr. Israel\u2019s claim to fame was that he was once an assistant to the late L.A. artist Jason Rhoades and served as the doorman for Rhoades\u2019s infamous \u201cBlack Pussy Soirée Cabaret Macramé\u201d parties. Now Mr. Israel has succeeded in taking the Warhol screen test to a whole new level by doing interviews with celebrities and quasi-celebrities in which he reads a series of bizarre and awkward questions\u2014to Rachel Zoe, \u201cIf you were to create the perfect salad, what would be the key ingredients?\u201d\u2014from a set of index cards he shuffles in his hands. His subjects are left trying to tell a personal story without help or support from their interlocutor. Mr. Israel\u2019s portraits, which seem to both emerge from and comment on the current Facebook/Twitter sound bite zeitgeist, are painful in the way Warhol\u2019s once were: they exist in an existential space devoid of human emotion or sympathy.\u000a\u000aUnlike Warhol\u2019s project, for the most part, Mr. Israel\u2019s guests are older, passé. They are walking, talking pieces of L.A.\u2019s cultural history. Taken together, they represent a sampling of L.A. personalities who were once at the center of the scene but now have one foot\u2014or, in some cases, both feet\u2014out the door.\u000a\u000aA TV-style interview where the questions are read right off note cards in a harsh and empty environment is a strange thing to watch. But only a few of Mr. Israel\u2019s victims realize they are being set up; most of them just writhe and sweat in their seats. I feel their pain. In the end I was left wondering: what is it like to have once been famous and important in L.A.? What comes after that?\u000a\u000aHis questions run the gamut from banal to bizarre. Adrienne Maloof, a reality-TV \u201chousewife of Beverly Hills,\u201d is asked, \u201cDid you ever cheat on a test?\u201d She answers without hesitation, \u201cNo, I helped others, the whole football team.\u201d Yet she never seems to reflect on what she just revealed to us, namely her relations with the \u201cwhole football team.\u201d Restaurateur Mr. Chow is asked, \u201cIn the battle between people and robots who wins?\u201d His answer should have been \u201cGet lost,\u201d but instead he responds, \u201cNature is more precise than a machine, every leaf is unique, just like every thumbprint \u2026 a robot is a machine and therefore has limitations.\u201d And it\u2019s funny! It gets worse when 71-year-old singer-songwriter Paul Anka is asked, \u201cChocolate or vanilla?\u201d and gives a three-minute monologue. Or when Jon Peters, the once-famous film producer and head of Sony pictures (and ex-Barbra Streisand hairdresser) gets caught in a trap when he\u2019s asked, \u201cAre you a good storyteller?\u201d and answers, with candor, \u201cWhen I was a kid I was more of a liar, but when I grew up I made those lies into a fantasy.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir moment in the spotlight may be over, but all of these guests are still dead set on proving their relevance, so much so that they are willing to talk at length to this unknown artist/interviewer. Most of them end up, tragically, revealing their hollow \u201cscreen test\u201d side. L.A. is a city obsessed with youth and power; it must not be very pleasant to feel marginalized in a place where you were once the center of attention.\u000a\u000aThat said, it\u2019s not all tragedy. At 95, Phyllis Diller gets credit, in my book, just for showing up. When asked, \u201cAre you reading anything?\u201d she supplies the riposte, \u201cI cannot read. I am losing my eyesight.\u201d Other interviewees didn\u2019t have such an easy out, and that makes for moments that are strangely poignant. Asked, \u201cWhat do you want the world to know about you?\u201d the seven-time NBA All-Star James Worthy replies, uncomfortably, \u201cBasketball is what I did for a living but it\u2019s not who I am as a person.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are some deliciously awkward moments. Cheryl Tiegs, the ravishing beauty who in 1975 graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, doesn\u2019t fare very well; she reveals that her favorite karaoke song is \u201cAt Last\u201d by Etta James. Quincy Jones is asked, \u201cWhat is your favorite color?\u201d Doesn\u2019t he remember the scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail when Sir Galahad is asked the very same question and answers: \u201dblue \u2026 uh, no \u2026 green\u201d and gets tossed down a ravine for his \u201cmistake\u201d? Clearly he doesn\u2019t, because he sheepishly answers, \u201cPurple, um \u2026 and lime, black and uh \u2026 orange,\u201d then gives the camera a pained smile. Perhaps the most cringe-worthy of the interviews is the one with JFK\u2019s nephew Bobby Shriver, who is painfully politically correct. \u201cWho would you most like to meet?\u201d he is asked, and he implausibly replies, \u201cI once opened the door to a room and there was Luciano Pavarotti \u2026 it was too much for me.\u201d How absurd for this to come from the man who created the global RED charity with his friend the rock star Bono. Oh, Mr. Shriver. Are we now to believe you were never into rock and roll, that all along you had us fooled, and were actually an opera buff?

aVIf Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has his way, Jaime Lannister will depart Game of Thrones in a brilliant flash of dragon fire. \u201cIt has to be a dragon death,\u201d he tells me, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the dragons that get him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re on the third floor of Greenwich Steakhouse, the Village melting outside under Manhattan\u2019s first truly warm day of the year, sitting surrounded by wine racks at a table long enough for a Lannister\u2019s living room. Coster-Waldau, his Danish accent far more pronounced than it is in Westeros, his eyes a White Walker shade of piercing blue, eats a single cookie off a tiny round plate, something I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if it were not being done by the six-foot-two result of a sketch artist being asked to draw Prince Charming. This cookie should be baked with gold, and there should be hundreds more; thousands more; enough to make A Song of Ice and Fire author George RR Martin spend at least four pages describing them.\u000a\u000aCoster-Waldau is in town to promote Evan Katz\u2019s low-budget noir Small Crimes, streaming now on Netflix, but one doesn\u2019t get Jaime Lannister in a room without discussing HBO\u2019s fantasy mega-hit; and one doesn\u2019t discuss Game of Thrones, period, without eventually discussing death. Which is how we land on the actor\u2019s desire for his own character\u2014the Lannister family\u2019s stone-jawed golden boy, incestuous father of two with sister Cersei (Lena Headey), a.k.a. Kingslayer, Oathbreaker and a whole host of other unsavory epithets\u2014to wave his one-handed farewell to the consistently kill-happy series by being burnt to a crisp by Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) massive, CGI dragons.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust fried,\u201d he says, clearly relishing the idea. \u201cHe has to burn. Has to.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, whether this is speculation or spoiler is known only by an extraordinarily exclusive crew; the series, debuted in 2011 and quickly ballooned into a worldwide phenomenon, has since surpassed its A Song of Ice and Fire source material. When it returns in July for its penultimate season, we will be over The Wall and into the unknown, the plot-points existing for now only in the heads of the cast and crew, series co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and George RR Martin himself.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s something important to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: the man is a sharer, to say the least, perhaps the result of being raised in Tybjerg, a tiny village situated in the countryside of southern Zealand. Within an hour of meeting him, I knew the TV series the actor was currently hooked on (Silicon Valley, loved the premiere); I knew the poster that hung on his childhood bedroom wall (the album cover of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d); I heard the story of a young Coster-Waldau serenading his schoolmates with a Rod Stewart cover (\u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy,\u201d of course) and was filled in on some hot Tybjerg gossip from circa 1980 about the time the principal of his middle school\u2019s wife started an affair with another teacher. \u201cNo, no, it gets even better,\u201d Coster-Waldau says before I could interrupt, fully headed down memory lane at this point. (For the record, it did get better. Small-town Denmark scandal is my new favorite scandal).\u000a\u000aSo, surely, nabbing a few spoilers from the biggest show on television by conversation\u2019s end wouldn\u2019t be out of the question, would it? \u201cFor years there was the whole thing with \u2018book readers\u2019 who knew what was going to happen. But it is more intense now, because nobody knows,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cThere has been a couple times where I\u2019ve actually, by accident, said something I shouldn\u2019t have. But because nobody knows, they don\u2019t necessarily pick up on it.\u201d\u000a\u000aI get what he\u2019s saying; the anticipation for more Thrones\u2014both show and book series\u2014has reached such a fever pitch of online hypothesizing and fan theories that an actual correct guess would be lost in the noise like a musician playing the wrong note in concert.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you go online you can definitely read every plot point that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou can find the ending of Game of Thrones on the internet. It\u2019s there. But you wouldn\u2019t know. Of course, nobody really wants to know.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, I throw the journalism ethics book out the third floor Greenwich Steakhouse window to abruptly correct my interview subject; I\u2019d very much like to know, on the record, the ending of Game of Thrones. He laughs. \u201cMaybe I should try it one day. Just say, \u2018Yeah, here is exactly what happens.\u2019 You\u2019d probably just go, \u2018Pfffft, no, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s right, of course. There is no way Jaime Lannister actually dies by dragon fire, no way the actor who plays him just came out and told me because, hey, how would I even know?\u000a\u000aRight?\u000a\u000aThe look on his face at this point, so self-assuredly charming in victory, is so Lannister-esque I half expect him to pick up that cookie\u2014that one single cookie off that tiny, tiny plate\u2014with a hand made of solid gold.\u000a\u000aIn the odd-ball dark comedy Small Crimes, Coster-Waldau plays ex-police officer Joe Denton, a world-weary five o\u2019clock shadow with legs pretty much the exact diametric opposite aesthetically of Jaime Lannister\u2019s flowing hair\u2019d gallantry; where people call Jaime \u201cKingslayer,\u201d the press calls Joe \u201cSlash Cop,\u201d a nod to the knife-wielding assault charge that landed him a six-year prison sentence. We meet Joe fresh out of jail for a bloody, brutal little film that often manages to simultaneously be quite funny, in which Coster-Waldau spends a great deal of screen time getting his ass kicked with everything from a stun gun to a pair of nunchucks.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love that stuff,\u201d the actor smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because he deserves it. What we tried to do, and I spoke to [writer-director Evan Katz] about this, I said \u2018we have to lean into that aspect of it, because it is such a dark story and Joe is such a scumbag.\u2019 You think it\u2019s going to be one of those movies where a guy turns his life around, and he then goes and makes every wrong decision you can possibly make. So you have to be able to laugh at him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe tried to find the humor even while he\u2019s getting beaten up. Like, when [co-star] Gary Cole tases me, it\u2019s like, you know\u2026\u201d Coster-Waldau trails off and instead convulses in his chair, tongue out and eyes bulging, in a comically over-the-top rendition of a man being tased in the stomach by well-known character actor Gary Cole.\u000a\u000aThat is another important thing to know about talking to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau: he\u2019s simultaneously animated and engaged, an interviewer\u2019s delight. He will answer with a specific story, a detailed childhood memory or thought-out rumination on life itself, and in lieu of an actual anecdote he\u2019ll act out an answer for you.\u000a\u000aPerfect example: When discussing his fondness for his truly immoral Small Crimes character\u2014and that fondness is delightfully palpable throughout\u2014Coster-Waldau begins by saying \u201ceven though Joe is suck a fuck-up, I still\u2026well I don\u2019t care for him but I still want to know what happens to him. I don\u2019t want to be his best buddy, but there\u2019s something about him. He\u2019s like, what\u2019s the word\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a loss, Coster-Waldau simply does a spot-on impression of a fishing lure staying afloat, bobbing relentlessly above the water\u2019s surface. \u201cJoe is like that,\u201d he goes on afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m back, I can still make it no matter what.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA running theme throughout Small Crimes is that abstract idea of \u201csecond chances\u201d; whether or not they exist, and what it then would mean to truly earn one.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do believe in second chances,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cGod knows I believe in third chances as well. But the thing is, do you believe you can actually change? Fundamentally change the person you are? I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when I press for specifics, a moment in time when the actor, be it professional or personal, was given a second chance, he draws a blank. He puts his face in his hand and thinks about it, really thinks about it because if Coster-Waldau is going to properly answer an interview question\u2014no, if he\u2019s going to offer a life lesson, he\u2019s going to find the right words. Right now, though, the only thing popping into his head is a 2014 film he starred in, quite literally titled A Second Chance.\u000a\u000aI posit, only half-jokingly, that perhaps he simply does not make mistakes.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I do. I do,\u201d he says. \u201cGod no, I have made mistakes. We all do. But I don\u2019t know about the whole idea that forgiveness is a one-off/ I\u2019ve gotten a lot of second chances. You kind of have to earn it. We have this weird belief, which is very fundamental to our culture, that forgiveness is to be given. You can just get it, you can be forgiven for anything. Which would be wonderful, because guilt is a bitch to carry around.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe brightens suddenly. \u201cI do remember one thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe actor launches into a story that occurred not in his career, or on the set of Game of Thrones, or even over the course of his now-19-year marriage to Greenlandic singer Nukaaka Coster-Waldau, but during his grade-school years. A classmate stole a Swedish exchange student\u2019s video game\u2014Coster-Waldau calls it \u201cone of those beep beep games,\u201d which is endlessly endearing\u2014which then ended up in his own possession.\u000a\u000a\u201cI couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of it,\u201d he remembers of harboring the contraband \u2018beep beep game.\u2019 \u201cI called another friend, and he said, \u2018You have to bring it to the principal.\u2019 It was beautiful, because it was so innocent. \u2018You have to.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe problem, Coster-Waldau tells me, is that the principal was \u201ca psychopath\u201d (one-third of the aforementioned scandalous affair, actually). But still, the young Coster-Waldau summoned his courage and returned the exchange student\u2019s console, and life in small-town Denmark moved on.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, no,\u201d Coster-Waldau laughs. \u201cThe principal actually made me feel terrible, like I was on my way to prison for probably the rest of my life. He kind of just took the game back and said \u2018you\u2019re a piece of shit, you little scumbag.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cMy point,\u201d he continues, now beaming, \u201cis that he did not give me a second chance. But just the fact that I did it actually made me feel better. It was the action, not the forgiveness. I knew that I did the right thing. Not him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich, oddly enough, brings us right back to Jaime Lannister.\u000a\u000aYou see, the incident that gave the character the title of \u201cKingslayer\u201d occurred before the events of Game of Thrones began; Jaime, still captain of the Kingsguard, drove a sword through the very king he swore to protect, Aerys II Targaryen. Which, yes, is not the best career move. What Jaime\u2019s detractors do not know is Aerys had given the order to ignite countless caches of wildfire hidden throughout the city, killing thousands of innocent people, when Jaime stepped in to stop him; a crucial fact we do not learn until a season 3 bath tub confession from Jaime to Gwendoline Christie\u2019s Brienne of Tarth.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this is true, why didn\u2019t you tell anyone? Why didn\u2019t you tell Lord Stark?\u201d asks Brienne, referring to Sean Bean\u2019s ultra-moral Eddark Stark.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?\u201d Jaime answers, one line of a performance that landed Coster-Waldau on many an Emmy Snubs list in 2013. \u201cHe judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, not to outright compare regicide with the theft of a middle-schooler\u2019s video game system, but there is a certain parallel. Jaime Lannister as a character lives a life condemned\u2014is \u201cOathbreaker\u201d really that far off from \u201clittle scumbag\u201d?\u2014because of a choice he made, that he and nearly he alone knows was right. It is, as Coster-Waldau said, the action that defines him, not anyone\u2019s forgiveness.\u000a\u000aFour seasons later, and this parallel still colors the way Coster-Waldau plays Jaime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat scene in season 3 was a very important moment,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe most important for Jaime, I think, was in that bath with Brienne. It was called \u2018Kissed by Fire,\u2019 that episode.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich is why,\u201d he concludes, \u201cI think Jaime should be killed by fire.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would be poetic, in its way. A perfect circle. Maybe a little\u2026too perfect? \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Coster-Waldau says. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember this when you\u2019re watching next season. You\u2019ll be like, \u2018Oh, fuck.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s kidding, of course. Jaime Lannister isn\u2019t going to be burned to death in season seven of Game of Thrones. That is not, as Coster-Waldau joked before, \u201cexactly what happens.\u201d Right?\u000a\u000aPffft, no, it\u2019s not.

aV50. Black Frame Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 30 Leadership: Brian Phillips, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 With clients that read like the guest list at a party where you won't get in, Black Frame's built a mystique as a luxury PR firm with one foot firmly planted downtown. Think Visionaire, Rodarte, Opening Ceremony and uber-interior-designers Yabu Pushelberg. Bonus points for naming its website Framenoir.\u000a\u000a49. Allison + Partners Last Year\u2019s List: 41 Employees: 300 Leadership: Scott Allison, co-founder, chairman and CEO Revenue: $46 million Founded: 2001 Despite the firm's SF roots, Allison + Partners' center of gravity has shifted to the Big Apple, now home to the largest team in its global network. Talent's where the firm is ruling; hires have landed from places like Edelman and Ogilvy. And the client roster's been fattened by the likes of Samsung, Adecco and Seventh Generation.\u000a\u000a48. The Magrino Agency Last Year\u2019s List: 47 Employees: N/A Leadership: Susan Magrino, chairman and CEO; Allyn Magrino, president and COO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 Susan and Allyn Magrino have built a lifestyle-PR powerhouse, with clients who now involve them in brand strategy before a product even launches. It's also a matchmaking pioneer, connecting, say, Richard Meier with Dom Perignon for a special edition. Despite brutal competition from upstarts like M18, the firm's more than held its own, with a food-hospitality-fashion stable that includes Baccarat, Lavazza, Hilton properties and Turnberry Isle.\u000a\u000a47. Boneau/Bryan-Brown Last Year\u2019s List: 44 Employees: 16 Leadership: Chris Boneau, Adrian Bryan-Brown, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 More than 200 BBB clients have won Tony Awards, cementing its place as the top name in theatre PR. Broadway\u2019s biggest hits, including The Book of Mormon and Jersey Boys, rely on the firm\u2019s smart strategy\u2014and upcoming partnerships with Cirque du Soleil and Nickelodeon mean BBB clients will continue to be conversation starters. Still, we're watching to see how DKC's acquisition of O & M affects the category (see DKC listing).\u000a\u000a46. High10 Media Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Lisa Dallos, CEO; Evan Strome, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 Lisa Dallos' media-centric firm is the only one whose team includes one employee in Maine and one in Tel Aviv. Whatever\u2014the firm's been killing it for media brands from Adweek to the Webby and Clio Awards to The Hill and New Republic magazines. And if you're wondering why the sale of a Manhattan gay bar rag to an L.A. media group was featured in the Hollywood Reporter this year, thank Ms. Dallos.\u000a\u000a45. APCO Worldwide Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Margery Kraus, founder and executive chairman Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 What started as a wonky D.C. agency has mushroomed into a brainy powerhouse with clients like IKEA, Wyndham hotels, and Microsoft, and leadership like ex-WSJ editor Kevin Goldman; from a staff of five, its NYC office now employs 50 and counting.\u000a\u000a44. Baltz & Company Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 29 Leadership: Phillip Baltz, founder and president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1998 With a profile so low he's practically underground, Phillip Baltz prefers to let his work do the talking. You would, too, with superstar restaurant clients like Dirt Candy, Pearl & Ash, Jonathan Waxman\u2019s JAMS, Beauty and Essex, Kat & Theo and...Chipotle.\u000a\u000a43. Dukas Linden Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Richard Dukas, chairman and CEO; Seth Linden, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2002 Dukas may have cost John Paulson $500 million this year. That wasn't its retainer; DLPR client Carson Block, a prominent short-seller, famously took down Chinese timber outfit Sino-Forest Corp., which subsequently tanked. Dukas itself had a better 2015, coming off the best stretch in its 13-year history\u2014and cracking $5 million for the first time. Broadcast is where the agency shines; if you're ever tuned into Bloomberg TV, CNBC or Fox, you've probably seen one of the 60-plus segments the firm books monthly for clients like Raymond James, EisnerAmper and Eaton Vance.\u000a\u000a42. The Peggy Siegal Company Last Year\u2019s List: 40 Employees: N/A Leadership: Peggy Siegal, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 If you want your movie to get into the Oscar race, it helps to have Peggy Siegal by your side. This year, the queen of film PR is handling publicity on both coasts for Spotlight and The Danish Girl, among others. Her secret? Lunchtime Q&As with top filmmakers, held at venues like the 21 Club. Ms. Siegal refers to these events as \u201ca press conference wrapped around a piece of chicken.\u201d\u000a\u000a41. PR Consulting Last Year\u2019s List: 30 Employees: N/A Leadership: Pierre Rougier, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 PR Consulting's website simply lists its clients. Since the agency's Sphinx-like about itself, we'll let the roster do the talking for founder Pierre Rougier: Hood by Air, Dior, Raf Simons, Rick Owens, LVMH, Dries Van Noten, Narciso Rodriguez, Christopher Kane, Versace. Oh, and Forever 21 and Joe Fresh. The firm's also expanded into food and hospitality, with Andre Balazs a notable client\u2014and it may be courting Grindr as well.\u000a\u000a40. Goodman Media Last Year\u2019s List: 19 Employees: 25 Leadership: Tom Goodman, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1996 Flashier firms may get the glory, but Tom Goodman's 25-person shop continues to get clients that matter, from The Economist to Grand Central Terminal to the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. A complete New York insider, founder Mr. Goodman surprised more than a few people by opening an office in Boston this year.\u000a\u000a39. Golin Last Year\u2019s List: 36 Employees: 1,000-plus Leadership: Fred Cook, CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 2004 Golin likes to call its reps "nice guys who kick ass," and that was certainly true this year, as its campaigns focused on positivity, but still got plenty of eyeballs. Among the firm's 2015 triumphs: partnering with Toyota for the Special Olympics World Games (Golin was the brains behind that viral Google Doodle) and rolling out the McDonald\u2019s All Day Breakfast campaign.\u000a\u000a38. Nicholas & Lence Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 39 Employees: 12 Leadership: Cristyne Nicholas, CEO; George Lence, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 2007 A quintessentially New York agency founded by deeply connected insiders, this firm represents city institutions like Michael Jordan's Steakhouse in Grand Central, the forthcoming New York Wheel on Staten Island, and Key Brand, the leading theater ticket seller, which owns brands like Broadway Box and Broadway.com. Does it get more New York than literally repping the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Foundation? Naturally, big city clients sometimes bring big city problems -- the Carnegie Deli has been closed since April when it was found to have an illegal gas hookup. But others\u2014like 2015 NASL Champions The NY Cosmos and Brookfield, the developer who led a successful opening of Brookfield Place and dipped a toe in Brooklyn\u2014show that an NYC-focused firm can punch way above its weight.\u000a\u000a37. MWW Last Year\u2019s List: 20 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Kempner, founder, president and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1986 MWW has its feelers in just about every sector of PR\u2014its many clients with commercial appeal include Verizon, Walgreens and JetBlue. It\u2019s also entered some areas other agencies fear to tread\u2014its LGBT wing, which represents It Gets Better, among others, looked particularly prescient after the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage equality ruling.\u000a\u000a36. Nasty Little Man Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 6 Leadership: Steve Martin, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1992 This firm may only have six employees, but its supernova clientele (Paul McCartney, David Bowie, U2) proves that in NYC PR, size doesn\u2019t always matter. Mr. Martin can be ferocious in defending his acts from unflattering coverage, including from his bête noir, the Observer\u2019s own Tim Sommer, but they love him for it. The Foo Fighters thought they were in big trouble when Dave Grohl broke his leg on the band\u2019s 20th anniversary tour, but once NLM rebranded it as the \u201cBroken Leg\u201d tour, the rockers continued to sell out stadiums.\u000a\u000a35. Paul Wilmot Communications Last Year\u2019s List: 32 Employees: N/A Leadership: Paul Wilmot, managing partner and chief executive Revenue: N/A Founded: 1997 Paul Wilmot's august fashion and beauty firm always manages to stay cool by choosing clients carefully; this year, it lent its cachet to client Parlux Fragrances, creators of new scents from Rihanna and Sean Combs. Wilmot's forever relationships with Kate Spade, H&M and Lane Bryant also mean its third decade is already looking as strong as its first two.\u000a\u000a34. Brunswick Group Last Year\u2019s List: 29 Employees: N/A Leadership: Steven Lipin, senior partner Revenue: N/A Founded: 1987 Brunswick doesn't divulge client lists, but its reputation as an 800-pound gorilla in financial communications precedes it. This year, the multinational firm added former Bloomberg editor Laurie Hays to its NYC office, and its let-our-hair-down digital/creative subsidiaries like MerchantCantos, Brunswick Arts and Blaise Projects keep cranking.\u000a\u000a33. KCD Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: N/A Leadership: Ed Filipowski, worldwide president and chief strategist; Julie Mannion, president of creative services Revenue: N/A Founded: 1984 KCD is a fashion Goliath whose industry-defining clients include style-section habitués like Alexander Wang, Balmain, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang and Tory Burch. Along with publicity, the agency produces shows, which means it wields serious power; KCD decides where everyone's seated.\u000a\u000a32. ID-PR Last Year\u2019s List: N/A Employees: 100 Leadership: Kelly Bush Novak, founder and CEO Revenue: N/A Founded: 1993 The ubiquity of client Serena Williams this summer\u2014how many magazine covers did she get?\u2014was just one example of ID\u2019s juice. Building on its roots in celeb/entertainment PR, where it still shines, the firm's making serious inroads with consumer and luxury brands, from Coca-Cola, AOL and Marriott to Westfield World Trade Center and Tiffany. Philanthropy's the next frontier: this year saw massive campaigns for deep-pocketed do-gooders like Unicef and Sean Penn's J/P HRO.\u000a\u000a30. 5W PR Last Year\u2019s List: 35 Employees: 125 Leadership: Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO Revenue: $21.5 million Founded: 2003 A generalist firm with fingers in the right pies\u2014from health care and hedge funds to tech and travel\u20145W's roster includes uber-New Yorky brands like Duane Reade, the Greater NY Taxi Association and Derek Jeter's Stop!t, along with global heavyweights like Unilever, L'Oreal and Krups. Founder Ronn Torossian claims the firm's revenue could double within five years; we don't doubt it. He also brokered an unlikely peace between Mayor de Blasio and client Sergeant\u2019s Benevolent Association.\u000a\u000a29. Sunshine Sachs Last Year\u2019s List: 1 Employees: 154 Leadership: Ken Sunshine, Shawn Sachs, Heather Lylis, Keleigh Thomas Morgan, partners Revenue: N/A Founded: 1991 How could they? That was the reaction to Sunshine Sachs' much-publicized Wikipedia screwup. It's a shame that the incident defined the agency's year, since last year's No. 1 firm is still having an incredible ride with giant nonprofit clients, A+ celebrities and massive growth in live events, like iHeartRadio's nationwide festivals. But it\u2019ll be a while before chatter stops about the Wikipedia episode.\u000a\u000aThey may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world. Hotels, its original client base, still bed down with M18 in droves. Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a11. M18 Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Michael Tavani and Meghan McGinnis, co-founders Revenue: N/A Founded: 2010 They may not always get what M18 means\u2014it\u2019s March 18th, the date the company was founded\u2014but real estate giants like Extell, Vornado and Silverstein know Michael Tavani\u2019s agency as the go-to for commercial and residential projects in the Big Apple and, increasingly, around the world.

Tavani\u2019s now eyeing a London office to keep up; we predict M18\u2019s own real estate will keep growing this year.\u000a\u000a27. Nadine Johnson Inc. Last Year\u2019s List: 21 Employees: N/A Leadership: Nadine Johnson, president Revenue: N/A Founded: 1995 Ms. Johnson's agency famously doesn't divulge client names, but it's known for sexy/artsy brands like Ace Hotels along with galleries, architects and high-end residential projects. The agency's still got serious juice, but suffered a blow this year when arts practice leader Adam Abdalla left to start his own firm, Cultural Counsel, as the Observer reported in July (see sidebar). Stay tuned.\u000a\u000a26. Shore Fire Media Last Year\u2019s List: 28 Employees: N/A Leadership: Marilyn Laverty, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 1990 The rotating playlist on Shore Fire\u2019s homepage speaks volumes about the firm\u2019s reach; Bonnie Raitt, Lana Del Rey, Zac Brown, Carole King, Brandi Carlile, Elvis Costello, Tedeschi Trucks Band and St. Vincent are all clients. In its 25th year, this music PR pioneer saw its clients grab the No. 1 spots on the Billboard, iTunes, Apple Music and Amazon charts. This year, Shore Fire expanded its repertoire with non-music clients like publishing mogul Maria Rodale and Tuesdays with Morrie author Mitch Albom. Shore Fire was also one of the first communications firms to HQ itself in Brooklyn; the move seems prescient now.\u000a\u000aWhat does $6.5 trillion look like? Ask Jennifer Prosek. That\u2019s the asset management client base advised by Prosek Partners\u2014and it\u2019s $1.5 billion more than last year. But Prosek\u2019s not getting complacent. The firm\u2019s just added supernova clients like Bloomberg, TDBank, Goldman Sachs, MetLife and TIAA. It lured Finsbury\u2019s former US CEO, Andy Merrill, as a partner. And the acquisition of Los Angeles-based Muirfield Partners extended the firm\u2019s reach. Icing: Prosek expects 25 percent year over year growth.\u000a\u000a22.

Stu Loeser & Co Last Year\u2019s List: 15 Employees: 8 Leadership: Stu Loeser, founder Revenue: N/A Founded: 2012 Mayor de Blasio lost several big fights this year, but two of the most visible were his loss of control of city schools and his failed attempt to cap Uber expansion in the city. It\u2019s no coincidence that both Uber and the charter school lobby were represented by Stu Loeser, the former Bloomberg press secretary who continues to have an outsize influence on city politics thanks to his small but mighty firm. But Mr. Loeser recently attracted some unwanted attention for his work on behalf of a non-union supermarket in the Hamptons.\u000a\u000a23. Becca PR Last Year\u2019s List: 27 Employees: N/A Leadership: Becca Parrish, founder and owner Revenue: N/A Founded: 2006 Becca Parrish has been fiercely loyal to clients like Le Bernardin, Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar and April Bloomfield's Spotted Pig, and they've returned the favor with long-standing relationships. New restaurateurs like Houseman\u2019s Ned Baldwin and Gabriel Kreuther have made her the go-to guru for launches. Now, with an L.A. office, she's branching into hotels and real estate.\u000a\u000a22. Makovsky Last Year\u2019s List: 7 Employees: 60 Leadership: Kenneth D. Makovsky, president Revenue: $15 million Founded: 1979 One of the top names in independent generalist PR, this firm\u2019s most high-profile clients include A.T.

They\u2019re not just guarding reputations, but active partners in nurturing them.\u000a\u000aPerhaps most significantly, they\u2019re breaking down boundaries to become key partners across the marketing spectrum, muscling in on territory once dominated by ad agencies, digital firms and content producers.\u000a\u000aAt a time when content reigns, \u201cPublic relations agencies are now regarded as stewards of the whole communications strategy,\u201d says Andy Polansky, CEO of Weber Shandwick (No. 2 on this year\u2019s PR Power 50 list). \u201cPR practitioners have never been held in higher regard.\u201d\u000a\u000aEver-expanding opportunities across the marketing spectrum make this \u201cthe most exciting time there\u2019s ever been for the business,\u201d says Don Baer, worldwide chair and CEO of Burson-Marsteller (No. 17). \u201cEveryone is veering into everyone else\u2019s lane.

At celebrity power shop PMK*BNC, a mini-firm called Vowel is creating viral content through which the agency\u2019s superstar celebrity clients often get paired with big brands in the PMK stable.

You just have to know what trail you want to go on.\u201d PMK markets Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cLenny Letter\u201d, which has become a huge viral hit in an area where a traditional firm wouldn\u2019t have ventured even five years ago.\u000a\u000aAn unintended consequence of this push and pull\u2014convergence and diffusion\u2014has been the resurgence of legacy agencies, which many had dismissed as dinosaurs once the landscape started shifting a few years ago.\u000a\u000aInstead, they learned to adapt, meshing cool new tools and lingo with their own gravitas as the grownups in the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe bring the judgment and experience that goes along with strategic thinking,\u201d says Mr. Baer of Burson, which launched a content arm called StudioB this year. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seasoning it with data, creativity and deep knowledge of media landscape. We\u2019re moving forward very assertively.\u201d\u000a\u000aSixty-seven-year-old Ruder Finn (No. 10), not long ago one of the stodgiest of the big players, has reinvented itself as a hip think tank, where clients get help with employee engagement, recruitment and even how their businesses are organized. \u201cWe call it ideation behind transformation,\u201d says CEO Kathy Bloomgarden, one of the few agency heads with a Ph.D. \u201cWe work to transform companies to make them more attractive to stakeholders both inside and outside. We sometimes help them change their culture.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll of it comes back to storytelling, says Weber Shandwick\u2019s Mr. Polansky, which is why PR firms should continue to rule.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreative is still king,\u201d he says. \u201cClients are looking for big ideas that are going to move the needle for their businesses, have an impact on how people think about their brands and influence decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s list reflects that.\u000a\u000aA word on methodology: Unlike other rankings, the Observer doesn\u2019t rely solely on size or revenue.

aVEveryone wants in on the streaming game. Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, Disney and now even Facebook all want a piece of the pie. But while those first few companies make sense in the context of streaming original content, it\u2019s hard to figure out what Facebook is doing in there.\u000a\u000aStarting this week in limited tests around the U.S., the Facebook Watch video tab will begin housing tons of short-form shows from a wide variety of partners that includes: A+E Networks, ATTN; BuzzFeed\u2019s The Try Guys, Conde Nast Entertainment, Group Nine Media, National Geographic, Time Inc., Mashabale, Hearst Magazines Digital Media, Tastemade, Quartz, Cheddar, the Atlantic, WNBA and Whistle Sports, according to Variety. While unexpected, this strategy does make sense as the social media platform has continually diversified its services since its inception, adding features such as instant messaging, live video feeds and more. Developing its own original streaming content was the next logical step.\u000a\u000aBut Facebook isn\u2019t stopping with a handful of planned shows. Their goal is to become the go-to outlet for all content creators.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are a platform for any creator or show,\u201d Facebook\u2019s VP of product Fidji Simo told Variety.\u000a\u000aIn terms of a business model, Facebook\u2019s structure is pretty straightforward. To start off, Facebook is not paying many of the content providers upfront that will be featured on Watch. Instead, per the outlet, it will divide ad revenue from midroll spots sold by the Facebook sales team while content creators will also be able to profit from branded content. However, Facebook is paying to produce a slew of original shows as well.\u000a\u000aMike Rowe\u2019s Returning the Favor, Conde Nast Entertainment\u2019s Virtually Dating and reality show Ball in the Family (about the family of LaVar Ball and Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball) all headline the upcoming exclusive series offerings from Facebook. Facebook entertainment head honcho Ricky Van Veen is also developing a revival of the MTV scripted show Loosely Exactly Nicole and reality-competition show Last State Standing. Those interested in delving into Facebook\u2019s original content will not want for options.\u000a\u000aBut these shows aren\u2019t meant to be the backbone of the service. Instead, they are only meant to help Facebook Watch get off the ground and demonstrate the possibilities.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe main reason we are funding them is to seed the ecosystem,\u201d Simo told the outlet. \u201cThe goal long term is absolutely that the ecosystem will be creating these shows.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhere Netflix and Hulu are hoping to attract top tier talent to create content for them, Facebook is hoping to inspire a deluge of quality user generated content in the future. This would give the platform an endless supply of material while keeping costs down, similar to YouTube. With two billion monthly users and the rising popularity of Facebook Live over the last couple years, that ambition actually seems attainable.\u000a\u000aNo word yet on when users can expect the Watch tab to become widely available outside of the limited testing. But when it does, it could change the way we produce, seek out and consume video content.

aVThe penthouse where Fyre Festival co-founder Billy McFarland was living until his arrest is now listed for sale. Scroll through to see the lavish apartment.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere was a time not so long ago when the world wasn\u2019t too familiar with the name Billy McFarland. But thanks to his role as co-creator of the disaster zone that was Fyre Festival, hearing it now brings to mind images of flimsy tents, a Hunger Games mentality on an island filled with feral dogs and sad cheese sandwiches.\u000a\u000aPrior to being arrested and charged with wire fraud earlier this summer due to the fiasco of Fyre Fest, McFarland was living his best life in a penthouse at 345 West 14th Street, because of course he would want to live in the Meatpacking District. Alas, now that McFarland is apparently not even able to pay for a lawyer, he is no longer living in the three-bedroom, 2.5-bath condo for which he was reportedly paying $21,000 a month.\u000a\u000aThe 2,106-square-foot condo is now up for sale, with a $7.5 million price tag attached\u2014McFarland has reportedly moved back in with his parents in New Jersey. But McFarland was a \u201cgreat tenant,\u201d Leslie J. Garfield broker Christopher Riccio, who is sharing the listing with Elana Zinoman, told the Wall Street Journal. Thankfully, they aren\u2019t using Emily Ratajkowski, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid to attempt to promote the unit.\u000a\u000aThe sleek penthouse features floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the living and dining room, which look out onto the Meatpacking District, so you\u2019re sure to see many an eager teen in a bandage dress and heels trying to navigate the cobblestone streets.\u000a\u000aThere are 10.5-foot ceilings, and the kitchen is fitted with custom oak millwork, granite countertops and backsplash as well as SubZero, Wolf and Bosch appliances, so it\u2019s definitely equipped for anyone to whip up more than the aforementioned cheese sandwiches that Fyre Fest attendees were given.\u000a\u000aThe master suite has its own walk-in closet, as well as a separate seating area with access to the 236-square-foot private terrace. The en-suite 5-fixture master bath has a glass-enclosed wet room as well as Spanish travertine marble, a soaking tub, brass vanity and granite countertops, so there\u2019s need for concern of sleeping arrangement akin to the literal disaster-relief tents at Fyre Festival.\u000a\u000aOne of the bedrooms is currently configured as an office, per the listing, so perhaps McFarland at one time used it for his business dealings\u2014it seems that the social club he founded, Magnises, might still be afloat.\u000a\u000aAnd while we\u2019re sure McFarland was hoping for a better outcome with his pricy rental, at least he wasn\u2019t sued in regards to this penthouse (at least, not that we know of), which is exactly what happened when he rented a $13,750 a month duplex in a West Village townhouse\u2014the owner pressed charges claiming he turned the building into an \u201cAnimal House.\u201d

aVPhotographer William Eggleston\u2019s Damien Hirst-like single artist sale made $5.9 million at Christie\u2019s New York yesterday, trouncing the $2.7 million estimate reported in The New York Times earlier this year, with every single one of the 36 lots on offer selling. That 100 percent sell-through rate is known in auction parlance as a white glove sale.\u000a\u000aSome of the works on offers were enlarged versions (measuring 44 by 60 inches) of the photographer\u2019s most iconic images from the 1970s and \u201980s, and were being sold to benefit the Eggleston Artistic Trust, which aims to preserve the 72-year-old artist\u2019s artistic legacy. Others came from negatives that he shot during those decades and never produced.\u000a\u000aTop-lot honors went to Mr. Eggleston\u2019s Untitled (1970), perhaps his best known image, a shot of a tiny three-wheel bicycle from a low vantage point, making it appear to loom over a single-story house in the background. It made $578,500, well above its $200,000 to $300,000 estimate, and amounted to a new record for a single print by the artist at auction.

aVDating is difficult\u2014for proof, just look at Aziz Ansari, who has built an entire television show around it, or watch the most recent episode of The Bachelorette, including its difficult breakup. But one would imagine (or daydream) that dating a royal might make the entire ordeal feel like a fairy tale\u2026but according to one woman who knows, it\u2019s far more demanding and full of expectations. Just ask Cressida Bonas\u2014Prince Harry\u2019s former girlfriend is speaking out about their time together and how she\u2019s changed since their breakup.\u000a\u000aThe couple dated for two years, after they were set up by Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. But despite murmurs of a royal wedding, they broke up in 2014. After a few wild years, Prince Harry settled down with American Suits actress and philanthropist Meghan Markle. Bonas is now back with her former boyfriend, Harry Wentworth-Stanley.\u000a\u000aIn the BBC Radio 4 interview, the socialite and actress discusses her role as George Orwell\u2019s second wife in a new play. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is good or bad,\u201d Bonas said of her character, although one could surmise it could be equally said of her conflicted ex. But the conversation didn\u2019t revolve entirely around the new play.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe try and see women in their own right as well as not being overshadowed by the men in their lives. But I wonder if your own personal experience had given you some insight. Of course you received huge amounts of publicity when you dated Prince Harry. Did that give you an insight into having your life defined\u2026by a much more famous man?\u201d the host asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s that thing of being pigeonholed,\u201d Bonas responded. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating, especially in the industry that I\u2019m in, but it is the way it is,\u201d she continued. Now she\u2019s \u201cmaking a stand and saying no, actually, this is who I am and this is what I want to do.\u201d Bonas deftly brought the conversation back to her acting career, proving that while she might not be a royal, she certainly has the decorum expected of one.

aV\u201cCome for a day, stay for a week,\u201d reads the tourism website of Cold Spring, New York. That\u2019s a fine slogan, but it did not, alas, apply to our intrepid contestants on Bravo\u2019s Work of Art: The Next Great Artist this week, who were destined to hop a train from Grand Central for a brief, nervous jaunt up and down the town\u2019s Main Street, during which time they marveled at how picturesque (read: creepy) everything was and how weird the locals were, before fleeing back to the (much less weird and creepy) world of reality television.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe name makes it sound like it has something to do with spa treatments,\u201d contestant Young Sun Han murmured rapturously, as if he\u2019d just discovered a Shangri-La for TV\u2019s gay stereotypes. (Look, there\u2019s village councilman Sean Hayes!)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe further we get away from the city the more it looks like home to me,\u201d Dusty meanwhile drawled sweetly. We\u2019ve ridden Metro North\u2019s Hudson Line, and the back lots of New England mini malls do not particularly resemble Arkansas\u2019s amber waves of grain, in our humble opinion.\u000a\u000a\u201cWelcome to the quaint town of Cold Spring, New York,\u201d says show hostess/rich person China Chow, looking like a Strangers on a Train murderess in a big trench coat. Two people were going to get the boot, we learned. But, \u201cIf you survive this challenge you will be competing for the grand prize,\u201d Ms. Chow threatened. Survive this challenge? Is that what they\u2019ve been doing with the eliminated contestants? The challenge, if you\u2019re interested, was to take $200 and find a way to create a portrait of a verifiable, salt of the Thornton Wilder-ian earth Cold Spring resident.\u000a\u000aKYMIA NAWABI\u000a\u000a\u201cI have laryngitis today,\u201d rasps the first quaint resident that Ms. Nawabi hassled. But fear not, for Bob and Barbara, owners of some kind of haunted tchochke shop, rise to the occasion, proving themselves to be part charming Stars Hollow, part \u201call work and no play.\u201d In Ms. Nawabi\u2019s terms, they\u2019re a solid blend of \u201cweirdness and also sweetness.\u201d The couple, we learn, has \u201calways loved dolls.\u201d So Ms. Nawabi makes a kind of dark, demonic Norman Rockwell painting of the duo, portraying them as ice skaters in front of scary antique miscellany\u2014they skated on their first date. \u201cThe only non-conventional thing is that they\u2019re going to have several arms,\u201d artist mentor/auctioneer Simon de Pury frets of Ms. Nawabi\u2019s painting. Which is funny, because when he gesticulates, he looks like a stop-motion photograph of a pitcher. \u201cGet some weirdness in it,\u201d he cautions.\u000a\u000aYOUNG SUN HAN\u000a\u000aMr. Han makes a beeline to the nearest bed and breakfast, to inquire about spa treatments and also \u201ctown secrets,\u201d because he\u2019s clearly been watching The Witches of Eastwick, and believes the two go hand in hand. While he gets a guided tour of the inn\u2019s nine rooms, variously furnished with Jacuzzis and wood-burning fireplaces he is left scrambling, at the very last moment, for a subject. Luckily, he pinpoints the next great artist of Cold Spring at the Terence Donovan gallery\u2014namely, jolly Mr. Donovan himself, whom Mr. Han pays $200 for a 20-minute portrait. And guess what? Terence\u2019s portrait is really nice\u2014it\u2019s got a little Karen Kilimnik, or even Elizabeth Peyton in its saucy yet tender broad-stroked depiction of its young male subject. (\u201cYou have kind of Justin Bieber-ish hair,\u201d Terence says, which is totally something we can imagine Ms. Peyton saying to any of her sweetly puckish subjects.) In the gallery, Mr. Han leans Terence\u2019s painting against a wall, behind wooden planks plastered with extreme-close-up photographs of Terence that he took of the artist while he worked.\u000a\u000aLOLA THOMPSON\u000a\u000aHaving been soundly rejected by the town motorcycle guy, Ms. Thompson seeks out the men who are next on the list of people most likely to succumb to her witchy ways and nymphette wiles. Dennis and Tommy, rare-coin-collecting gentlemen, succumb to her flirtation, handing over a 1928 five-dollar bill to her. Ms. Thompson then prepares a multi-faceted, mostly non-figurative portrait/tribute to the two collectors, featuring a letter she wrote to them, which begins, \u201cDear Dennis and Tommy, You are the secret historians of Cold Spring\u201d (or maybe not so secret\u2026). There\u2019s also some tinfoil, and a pyramid of blown-up images of historic bills, and some other things on a shelf.\u000a\u000aDUSTY MITCHELL\u000a\u000aMr. Mitchell shyly settles on a little girl as his subject. She likes candy\u2014\u201call kinds!\u201d\u2014 and reminds the contestant of his daughter Cora, whom he abandoned in her infancy to go off to (an art-reality-TV) battle, and who, when this episode was filmed, had just turned one the previous day. Mr. Mitchell decides to make a mosaic of his young subject\u2019s face from M&Ms. Mr. de Pury\u2014who, in his most hilarious joke of season two, says he wants to \u201ccome to AR-Kansas\u201d\u2014briefly convinces Mr. Mitchell to work on a portrait made from folded-paper fortune-tellers, before the contestant runs out of time and returns to his candy idea. By that point, however, it\u2019s too late for the glue to dry, so M&Ms keep falling off it. Mr. Mitchell hopes that everyone will find this decomposition \u201cinteresting.\u201d\u000a\u000aSARA JIMENEZ\u000a\u000aBecause she always seems wryly uninterested in everything around her, Ms. Jimenez drives away her first potential subject, before finding friends among the local firemen. One older firefighter, Jackie, is of particular interest to Ms. Jimenez. He\u2019s battled blazes for 58 years, thereby inspiring a quite charming backlit portrait made from aluminum (which weirdly kind of resembles Mao) paired with an uninspiring dangly sculpture of aluminum and charcoal nameplates, one for every year Jackie served.\u000a\u000aTHE CRITIQUE\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s guest judge is pop-star portraitist Richard Phillips, who, for the record, is much taller than critic/judge Jerry Saltz and Ms. Chow, even in her crazy-tall heels, but maybe not taller than gallerist/judge Bill Powers\u2019 hair. The local portrait subjects show up for the gallery showing, and luckily enough, none of them are perceptibly offended by their variously unflattering, candy-coated, epistolary and so forth depictions.\u000a\u000aWINNER\u000a\u000aKymia Nawabi wins the first slot on the final episode for her cartoonish portrait because, as Ms. Chow says of Bob and Barbara, \u201cI met them and they\u2019re cartoons!\u201d That\u2019s not very nice, we think, and neither is Mr. Phillips\u2019 comment on the piece: \u201cAt first I was throwing up inside.\u201d But apparently none of that matters when you\u2019re in the final trio of possible next great artists.\u000a\u000aALSO HEADED TO THE FINALE\u000a\u000aYoung Sun Han, who we think should probably be facing an intellectual-property/copyright suit from Terence right about now, slinks by, even though the judges point out that he should have just shown Terence\u2019s painting. (Weird how the next great artist is not even a contestant on this show\u2026 Team Terence!) Sara Jimenez, meanwhile, also will compete in the final episode, mostly because Mr. Saltz is so proud that his little charge worked outside of her \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d Personally, we\u2019re freaked out that she referred to her portrait of Jackie (who\u2019s alive and thriving) as a \u201cmemorial.\u201d\u000a\u000aGOING HOME\u000a\u000aDusty Mitchell is at last taking that long covered-wagon ride back to Arkansas, mostly because too many of his artworks were literally paint-by-numbers pieces. And Lola Thompson will hop Al Pacino\u2019s jet back to Los Angeles because Ms. Chow doesn\u2019t understand why the currency pyramid counts as a portrait (odd, since Ms. Chow resembles money). Also, it\u2019s too scattered in its abstraction for the rest of the judges. And there is much crying.

aVIn the 160 or so years since the first skyscrapers were built, technological innovations of many kinds have allowed us to build them to reach astonishing heights. Today there is a 1,000-meter (167-story) building under construction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Even taller buildings are possible with today\u2019s structural technology.\u000a\u000aBut people still don\u2019t really live in skyscrapers the way futurists had envisioned, for one reason: Elevators go only up and down. In the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies, \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and others, we see cableless boxes that can travel not just vertically but horizontally and even diagonally. Today, that future might be closer than ever. A new system invented and being tested by German elevator producer ThyssenKrupp would get rid of cables altogether and build elevators more like magnetic levitation trains, which are common in Japan and China.\u000a\u000aOur work at the nonprofit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat studies how tall buildings can better interact with their urban environments. One aspect is a look at how buildings might work in a world of ropeless elevators. We imagine that people might live, say, on the 50th floor of a tall building and only rarely have to go all the way down to street level. Instead, they might go sideways to the next tower over, or to the bridge between them, for a swim, a trip to the doctor or the grocery store.\u000a\u000aThis research project, set to conclude in September 2018, will explore as many of the practical implications of ropeless elevator travel as possible. But we already know that thinking of elevators the way ThyssenKrupp suggests could revolutionize the construction and use of tall buildings. Builders could create structures that are both far taller and far wider than current skyscrapers \u2013 and people could move though them much more easily than we do in cities today.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to get high\u000a\u000aVery few buildings are taller than 500 meters because of the limitations of those everyday devices that make high-rise buildings practical in the first place \u2013 elevators. Traditional, steel-rope-hung elevators can travel only around 500 meters before the weight of the rope itself makes it inconvenient. That takes more and more energy and space \u2013 which all costs developers money.\u000a\u000aReplacing steel ropes with carbon fiber ones can save energy and space. But even so, people who want to go to the uppermost floors from the lowest floors don\u2019t want to wait for the elevator to stop at the dozens of floors in between. That means developers need to make room in their buildings for multiple shafts, for express and local elevators, and for \u201csky lobbies\u201d where people can switch between them. All of that space devoted to vertical transportation reduces the amount of rentable space on each floor, which makes the economics of the building more difficult the higher it gets.\u000a\u000aTraveling in three dimensions\u000a\u000aA new elevator system uses electric linear induction motors \u2013 the same kind of contactless energy transfer that powers magnetic levitation trains \u2013 instead of cables to move elevator cars around. This also lets them move independently of each other in a shaft, which in turn means multiple cabins can be working in one shaft at the same time. That reduces the need for parallel shafts serving different floors and frees up more real estate for commercial use. And there\u2019s no inherent limit to how far they can travel.\u000a\u000aEven more exciting is that these cabins can travel horizontally, and potentially even diagonally: The motors pivot to follow the powered track, while the floor of the cabin remains level. That opens up a whole world of possibilities. Without the ropes, it is also feasible to reduce the number of shafts a building requires, by allowing more cars to travel in one single shaft. It also becomes feasible to build massive building complexes interconnected by motorized vehicles operating high above the ground.\u000a\u000aThe difference between an elevator and a car, or even a train, becomes less clear \u2013 as does the difference between a building, a bridge and an entire city. Instead of descending from your 50th-floor apartment to the street in an elevator, then taking a taxi or the subway to another building across town, and going back up to the 50th floor, you might instead have a door-to-door ride between buildings, at height, in a single vehicle.\u000a\u000aCreating the cities of the future\u000a\u000aIs the world actually ready for this? Probably not right away. In the short term, we can expect to see systems like carbon-fiber-roped and ropeless elevators used in some of the very tallest, most high-profile (and expensive) buildings. Many of these structures house spaces used for many different purposes \u2013 residences, restaurants, retail stores, offices, cinemas and even sports. The people who live in, work in or visit those buildings have a wide range of destinations \u2013 they might want to stop at a shop to pick up something before going to a friend\u2019s apartment for dinner before heading to a movie. And so they need options for traveling within the building.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, these systems are far more expensive than the conventional alternatives. Building owners won\u2019t use them until they can save \u2013 or earn \u2013 lots more money by building systems like this. But as we\u2019ve seen with computers and many other forms of technology, the cost goes down rapidly as more people buy the systems, and as research advances improve them.\u000a\u000aThere are probably physical constraints and efficiency limits on how many elevator cars could share a particular complex of shafts and passageways. And structural engineers might need to analyze what supports and reinforcements are needed to move people and machinery throughout large buildings. But the tall building industry has no standard data or recommendations to guide designers today. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to develop.\u000a\u000aThe technology is arriving \u2013 and with them the certainty that the old ways of traveling through a building are about to change more substantially than ever before.\u000a\u000aAntony Wood is the Executive Director of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat; a Visiting Professor of Architecture and Urban Planning at Tongji University Shanghai; and a Research Professor of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Dario Trabucco is a Tenured Researcher in Building Technology at the Università Iuav di Venezia.

aVNew Yorkers have always known their city is the center of the universe, so it seems only fair that New York ought to play such an unusually outsized role in this year\u2019s presidential race.\u000a\u000aSure, the city has always funded presidential campaigns and has always seen the candidates visit if only to meet with rich people from whom they would like money. But the state has rarely weighed in formally on the race with a presidential primary that was actually competitive\u2014and never has it had competitive primaries in both parties at the same time. Now, instead of meeting only with the monied class, the candidates are eating pasta in the Bronx and matzo in Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aIf having the candidates campaign in New York City, with all its ethnic food and tabloid drama, wasn\u2019t enough, two of the candidates most likely to become the next president are New York residents.\u000a\u000aWith the star power of the presidential campaign in town, it seems even the city\u2019s biggest personalities\u2014its gangly mayor, its mercurial governor, its swaggering prosecutor and grinning police commissioner\u2014have taken a backseat to the action. The campaign is all anyone is talking about, including Mayor Bill de Blasio himself, who has been pining to be a go-to progressive pundit and favored surrogate of Hillary Clinton, with less-than-stellar results.\u000a\u000a(Indeed, Mr. de Blasio has been lucky that all eyes are on the primary: It has meant less attention is being paid to reported investigations of his campaign contributions and his administration\u2019s role in a controversial property sale.)\u000a\u000aThe 2016 race seems to swirl around nearly everyone, as New York Democrats jockey for favor with their old pal Ms. Clinton\u2014perhaps looking for appointments down the line\u2014and jockey for headlines bashing their hometown foe, Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s power list has a decided focus, then, on the national figures who call New York City home, the local folks who help keep them in the running and the possibilities the future holds for those people\u2014and what it could all mean for everybody else in town.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Schumer, Senator\u000a\u000aMr. Schumer has been ravenously ambitious since his days as a pothole-filling assemblyman from Brooklyn. Now, as the anointed next leader of the Senate Democrats, with the Democratic Party facing favorable prospects in November, there\u2019s an excellent chance you\u2019ll be calling him Majority Leader Schumer in 2017.\u000a\u000aNew York has never had a majority leader, let alone one from the borough of Kings, and Mr. Schumer will cement his role as the Empire State\u2019s most important elected official. Our city has long struggled on the federal terrain\u2014urban issues just aren\u2019t sexy to Republican congressmen from the Ozarks\u2014but with Mr. Schumer as one of the most powerful elected officials in the country, we\u2019re bound to do a little bit better. No matter who becomes the president\u2014more on that later\u2014Mr. Schumer is one New Yorker who is assured a spot near the top of the heap in Washington.\u000a\u000aHe also arrives at a precarious time for his own party, even as Democrats gloat about the crackup of the GOP in the Year of Trump. The grassroots left, powering Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign, is ascendant, and the centrist Schumer has never had a very comfortable relationship with the most liberal end of the Democratic Party. His defense of Wall Street and his ability to raise prodigious sums of money from the financial sector were once nothing but an asset. Mr. Schumer\u2019s rise to power came in part because he could raise cash as well as anyone in politics. Now, with angry progressives demanding purity from their Democrats, Mr. Schumer will have to figure out how to balance his own pragmatist instincts with a political environment that may be unfriendly to people like him. Does Mr. Schumer tack left? Or for the first time in his career, does he resist the political current?\u000a\u000a2. Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State\u000a\u000aNot since Thomas Dewey challenged Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 have two New Yorkers\u2014one a mid-life arrival, the other native-born\u2014vied against each other for the White House. And while Ms. Clinton\u2019s democratic socialist primary opponent, Mr. Sanders (a son of Brooklyn himself), may have a few rounds left in him, her nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate is all but assured, assuming nothing comes of her email scandal. Voters remain lukewarm to the ex-secretary of state, but New York\u2019s political elite has scrambled to hoist the former Empire State senator onto their shoulders. The names of her top surrogates in the city dot this list, and some could easily wind up in her administration should she triumph in November. A polarizing figure, Ms. Clinton could have the good fortune of facing an opponent this fall whose unfavorability ratings outstrip even her own.\u000a\u000aAbout that opponent. Mr. Trump, too, is a New Yorker who could be the next president. But truth be told, his influence in this town seems largely relegated to being the target of ire from Democrats, who see a win-win in criticizing a candidate so deeply disliked by so many, even as he is beloved by those who show up to his rallies and to vote for him. It\u2019s unclear yet whether Mr. Trump has shattered the Republican Party or revitalized it, or whether his campaign will be little more than a passing spasm of anti-establishment outrage\u2014and as such, the extent of his true power as a player in New York City remains unclear, too.\u000a\u000aThis list will go to press just hour before some of these open questions will be answered in our state\u2019s primary. If Mr. Trump cracks 50 percent in his hometown, it\u2019ll boost him toward the convention and argue he can be competitive in the northerast in the general. An under-convincing win here will be rough for Ms. Clinton, but if she can win by 10 or more points she\u2019ll keep surging toward November.\u000a\u000a3. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney\u000a\u000aAll pols fear the probing, sardonic eye of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District. After falling heavily last year on the two most powerful legislators in the state, ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and former State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, it seemed to pass over Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2014though the prosecutor is still reportedly peering into potential sweetheart contracts for donors in Buffalo.\u000a\u000aNow Mayor Bill de Blasio and his NYPD are in the anticorruption evangelist\u2019s sights. At issue are likely illegal gifts cops seem to have received from two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top contributors in Brooklyn\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community. The investigation may also implicate one or more of the much-criticized nonprofits the mayor created to raise cash and advance his liberal agenda, which the group Citizens Union labeled a \u201cshadow government\u201d earlier this year.\u000a\u000aGiven his success exposing shady dealings in Albany, City Hall and on Wall Street, Mr. Bharara (a former aide to Mr. Schumer) could well become the attorney general for the United States under a Clinton administration\u2014or, given that Ms. Clinton set up her controversial \u201chomebrew\u201d email server on his turf, he could wind up leading the investigation that denies her the White House.\u000a\u000a4. Andrew Cuomo, Governor\u000a\u000aJust in time for the presidential season, the famously cautious and calculating governor banked left\u2014hard. He forewent his own rumored bid for the White House to instead become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s earliest endorsers and biggest boosters in New York. He also embraced two of the causes he once scoffed at: a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. Both passed in this year\u2019s budget, giving New York some of the most liberal labor laws in the country.\u000a\u000aThe governor has also abandoned his once-proud fiscal conservatism, announcing billions upon billions of dollars worth in infrastructure investments. Every decrepit and despised New York transit hub would get demolished then built anew under the governor\u2019s designs: LaGuardia Airport, Penn Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Nobody seems to know yet where all the money will come from, but sources tell the Observer Mr. Cuomo sees these projects as his legacy in office.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Cuomo is auditioning for some role in Ms. Clinton\u2019s Cabinet (or what that role would be\u2014they\u2019re based in the same state, so vice president is pretty much off the table) or whether he just decided to spite his rival, Mr. de Blasio, by snatching away the mantle of progressivism. Either way, New York City will be a very different place by the time he departs Albany.\u000a\u000a5. Bill de Blasio, Mayor\u000a\u000aFor all his bumbling, fumbling, stumbling, bobbling, unforced errors and outright pratfalls, Mr. de Blasio managed this spring to push through what may be his most significant accomplishment in office: rezoning New York City. From now on, developers will get the benefit of loosened height and density restrictions, but they\u2019ll have to set aside 25 to 30 percent of new apartments for middle-class and lower-middle class tenants.\u000a\u000aThe mayor is still missing a new version of the 421a building tax credit\u2014the gas for his affordable housing engine\u2014but the rule changes have potential to permanently change both the city\u2019s rental market and its physical terrain. That will doubtless outlast Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure at Gracie Mansion, however long that ends up being.\u000a\u000aAfter a few flirtations with his ideological cousin Mr. Sanders, Mr. de Blasio belatedly backed Ms. Clinton, his former employer, for president. His hesitance seemed to earn him her ire, but the mayor paid his penance knocking on doors for her in Iowa, and she appears to have warmed to him again. His grandiose hopes to hold a candidate forum and shape the 2016 race have fallen through, and he seems to have accepted a humbler role in the process, shilling for her in New York, the same as nearly every other Democrat in the city.\u000a\u000aHe just better hope that Mr. Bharara\u2019s investigation goes away.\u000a\u000a6. Bill Bratton, Police Commissioner\u000a\u000aThe media-savvy police commissioner about town was at the top of this last year and with good reason: Mr. Bratton is many ways a better politician than the mayor who hired him. He is still the commissioner who seems to get the most leeway from the mayor he serves. But while Mr. Bratton dominated city headlines last year\u2014going against the mayor to call for more cops in the\u000a\u000abudget, dealing with the fallout of massive antipolice protests\u2014things are simply a bit quieter this year, as City Hall moved to focus on housing more than the issues aligned with the NYPD. And Mr. Bharara\u2019s probe into higher-ups at the NYPD accepting gifts is sure to be a headache\u2014though the mayor is doubtless glad he chose Mr. Bratton to lead the department over one of the men being investigated, former Chief of Department Philip Banks. Mr. Bratton continues to say what\u2019s on his mind, even jumping into the presidential race to take Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to task\u2014and tell him to \u201cshut up\u201d\u2014in response to his proposal to monitor Muslims to prevent terror attacks. Any police commissioner is a major presence in New York but particularly this one, with his penchant for hitting the best restaurants and the biggest social events, filling a role that the homebody mayor doesn\u2019t seem to enjoy much.\u000a\u000a7. Carl Heastie, Assembly Speaker\u000a\u000aHis first year as Assembly speaker, Mr. Heastie gained a reputation for the same detached taciturnity as his predecessor Mr. Silver. This spring, he showed for the first time that he might have some of the fallen pol\u2019s famed negotiating prowess. The Bronx lawmaker shielded the city from up to a billion dollars in cuts to the CUNY system and in Medicaid assistance from Albany that Mr. Cuomo had proposed in his budget. He also laid out a plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, to the governor\u2019s chagrin, indicating that Mr. Heastie is looking to put pressure on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s left flank.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nearly impossible to decipher the speaker\u2019s motivations, but he\u2019s the closest thing Mr. de Blasio has to a powerful friend in Albany\u2014even though he\u2019s much closer to the mayor\u2019s main rival at home, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.\u000a\u000a8. Melissa Mark-Viverito, Council Speaker\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the City Council as mainly a rubber stamp for the mayor\u2014but even if it is, its speaker is looking to make the most of her position. Ms. Mark-Viverito has tried to assert her\u000a\u000aindependence from Mr. de Blasio: making amendments to his housing plan, throwing cold water all over his crumbling effort to ban horse carriages (but only after first carrying the water for it), breaking from him on the efforts to cap Uber in the city. But she\u2019s also used her perch to be a voice on national issues, speaking out frequently on immigration and representation of Latinos in local government and becoming a favored surrogate for Hillary Clinton. In fact, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s political prowess was perhaps best on display with her endorsement of Ms. Clinton\u2014particularly considering how Mr. de Blasio bungled his. Plenty of people are whispering about whether the speaker might be offered a spot in a future Clinton administration when her term in the Council expires.\u000a\u000a9. Anthony Shorris, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aThe unsung bureaucrat who makes City Hall go around, Mr. Shorris is the man who does the day-to-day managing of the city as its first deputy mayor. He took a leading role in reassessing the city\u2019s services for the homeless after one of his fellow deputy mayors hastily left the department and the leader of the Department of Homeless Services was seemingly pushed out. His institutional knowledge of government has been key for Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a10. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs CEO\u000a\u000aThe Goldman Sachs CEO has come a long way from the Brooklyn housing projects he grew up in\u2014financially at least. A search of Ms. Clinton\u2019s donor rolls comes up flush with his employees, providing fodder for both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. (That goes without mentioning all those speeches Goldman paid the former first lady to deliver.) He also counts Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife among his underlings, and he enjoys a fairly warm relationship with Mr. de Blasio.\u000a\u000a11. Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator\u000a\u000aFor now, Gillibrand will be in Schumer\u2019s shadow, but New York\u2019s junior senator has been building her profile as an advocate for women and the sexually abused. Long-removed from her days as a conservative upstate lawmaker viewed skeptically by the city\u2019s Democratic establishment, she just may be future presidential candidate material.\u000a\u000a12. Steven Banks, Commissioner of Social Services\u000a\u000aMr. Banks has emerged in the last year as a major player in the mayor\u2019s administration, rising up a somewhat obscure post at the Human Resources Administration to become the face of the city\u2019s response to a growing and difficult to manage homelessness problem\u2014and its brand-new Commissioner of Social Services. Mr. Banks, who made his bones at the Legal Aid Society suing the departments he now leads, will now oversee both the HRA and the Department of Homeless Services. Even-handed and hyper-knowledgeable about his field, Mr. Banks clearly has the trust of Mr. de Blasio, who has let Mr. Banks lead several of his own City Hall press conferences.\u000a\u000a13. James Capalino, CEO of Capalino + Company\u000a\u000aThis veteran lobbyist\u2019s fortunes have steadily risen since City Hall was taken over by Mr. de Blasio\u2014making his lobbying firm the highest-earning in the city. That\u2019s raised some eyebrows, considering Mr. Capalino\u2019s close relationship with Mr. de Blasio, for whom he\u2019s raised campaign cash. That tight relationship has been attractive to clients of Mr. Capalino\u2019s, particularly the real estate powerhouses like Brookfield Properties and SL Green that employ him. But what\u2019s really put Mr. Capalino in the spotlight, and under the microscope, is his connection to a deal that has proven disastrous for the mayor: the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side property that will allow a private developer to turn what was once an nursing home for AIDS patients into luxury condos\u2014and which helped the building\u2019s owner make a $72 million profit selling it.\u000a\u000a14. Hakeem Jeffries, Congressman\u000a\u000aPossibly Brooklyn\u2019s brightest rising star, the congressman has become one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s top lieutenants in the black community. A relatively new member of the New York delegation and a Democrat in the Republican House, Mr. Jeffries has long reportedly eyed other pols\u2019 jobs\u2014including Mr. de Blasio\u2019s and Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s. Perhaps a job in the White House would be a suitable outlet for his ambitions.\u000a\u000a15. Vicki Been and Carl Weisbrod, Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner and Planning Chairman\u000a\u000aThe dynamic duo at the forefront of the mayor\u2019s plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing in a decade, Ms. Been and Mr. Weisbrod played major roles in cajoling the planning commission and city council to pass the mayor\u2019s massive rezoning plan. But even after that victory, there\u2019s still plenty to be done in terms of neighborhood-specific efforts, like the combative one underway in East New York.\u000a\u000a16. Thomas Prendergast, MTA Chairman\u000a\u000aMr. Prendergast not only runs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2014and therefore oversees a vital part of nearly every New Yorker\u2019s day\u2014he also serves as a major New York City surrogate for Gov. Cuomo. Often, that means going toe-to-toe with the mayor, arguing over things like the city\u2019s share of the bill for the MTA.\u000a\u000a17. Michael Bloomberg, Former Mayor\u000a\u000aMr. Bloomberg couldn\u2019t stay away from politics forever. When it looked like the nation might face a Sanders/Trump race for the presidency, the billionaire media mogul publicly weighed injecting another New Yorker into the mix\u2014himself. He ultimately realized an independent doesn\u2019t have a prayer in America\u2019s two-party system, but he bitterly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive and demagogic\u201d style upon withdrawing from contention. Look for him to endorse Ms. Clinton after the convention, possibly with his wallet.\u000a\u000a18. Emma Wolfe, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs\u000a\u000aA veteran member of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inner circle, Ms. Wolfe is the mayor\u2019s political fixer and his liaison to the groups outside City Hall with which he must work\u2014the governor\u2019s office, unions, the City Council and just about everyone in Albany. Behind her aw-shucks demeanor is a tough and experienced political operative and one of the mayor\u2019s closest and sharpest advisers.\u000a\u000a19. Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation\u000a\u000aDismiss Mr. Murdoch\u2019s New York Post at your peril. The venerable tabloid is forever a pain for any mayor but especially this one\u2014who just last week saw himself on the wood (that\u2019s the cover, for those who don\u2019t know tab-speak) three days in a row, accused of scandal. For readers who like their criticism of Mr. de Blasio a little classier, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s got The Wall Street Journal\u2014which also offers influential reporting on just about everything else. And then, there\u2019s that little cable powerhouse Fox News. In a town where the media is a major force, Mr. Murdoch is the force behind plenty of it.\u000a\u000a20. Dean Fuleihan, Budget Director\u000a\u000aThe city\u2019s moneyman, Mr. Fuleihan oversees New York\u2019s mammoth budget\u2014proposed to be $82.1 billion this year. It\u2019s a less stressful job than in years past, now that the city has inked contracts with most of the municipal workforce and with a budget the mayor himself has admitted isn\u2019t exactly as exciting as his previous ones. But when it comes to budgets, as City Hall has also noted, boring can be good. Perhaps the biggest challenge is working with Albany\u2014something Mr. Fuleihan, a former aide to disgraced ex-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, knows plenty about.\u000a\u000a21. Alicia Glen, Deputy Mayor\u000a\u000aPerhaps the most headline-grabbing challenge of Ms. Glen\u2019s deputy mayorship, shepherding through the mayor\u2019s affordable housing plan, is done now that the plan has been approved. But there will be plenty of work to do make that plan a reality\u2014particularly in the absence of the 421a tax credit that induces so many developers to build. And Ms. Glen will remain a bridge to the real estate types and private companies that play a major role in economic development in the city.\u000a\u000a22. James Malatras, Director of State Operations\u000a\u000aMr. Malatras is Gov. Cuomo\u2019s go-to-guy on policy, and lately it seems like lots of the policies that Mr. Cuomo rolls out focus on New York City. Mr. Malatras is tasked with putting out fires like the one Mr. Cuomo set when he proposed shifting nearly half a billion dollars of costs for CUNY to the city.\u000a\u000a23. George Gresham, 1199SEIU President\u000a\u000aGresham, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, is the unique figure who manages to be on good terms with both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo. As the head of the largest union in the state, he\u2019s been at the forefront of the fight for $15 push and remains maybe the most important New York labor leader out there.\u000a\u000a24. Dean Baquet, Executive Editor of The New York Times\u000a\u000aIf the screaming headlines of the Post or the woodcuts of the Journal aren\u2019t your speed, how about Mr. Baquet\u2019s Grey Lady? As the editor of the Times, Mr. Baquet determines all the news fit to print on politics ranging from City Hall to Albany to the campaign trail. Plenty of reporters have been plucked from local politics beats to chase the presidential candidates\u2014but at the same time, the paper is beefing up its presence in City Hall.\u000a\u000a25. Phil Walzak, Senior Advisor to the Mayor\u000a\u000aAfter a rocky stint as press secretary\u2014a gig that wasn\u2019t quite what he wanted in the first place\u2014Mr. Walzak has settled in as \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the mayor. He still spends a decent amount of his time crafting Mr. de Blasio\u2019s message, at least when he and the mayor aren\u2019t heading off on road trips to watch ballgames.\u000a\u000a26. Jonathan Rosen, Co-Founder ofBerlinRosen\u000a\u000aMr. Rosen, of the PR firm BerlinRosen, is perhaps Mr. de Blasio\u2019s best-known outside consultant\u2014but the mayor\u2019s relationship with Mr. Rosen and others has been gaining greater scrutiny. Mr. Rosen is not a lobbyist and as such does not have to disclose his meetings with the mayor, but his firm represents a slew of boldfaced names that have major business at City Hall. BerlinRosen also handles the mayor\u2019s nongovernmental press, putting out his message as Mr. de Blasio continually tries to influence national politics and spinning on issues like his campaign contributions.\u000a\u000a27. Michael Mulgrew, President of the United Federation of Teachers\u000a\u000aWhile the UFT originally backed former comptroller Bill Thompson, Mr. Mulgrew came around pretty quickly to Mr. de Blasio: The union was the first to ink a new contract with City Hall, and from there Mr. Mulgrew hasn\u2019t looked back. He\u2019s been a frequent visitor to City Hall and a loud defender of the mayor. That must be a welcome change for Mr. Mulgrew after 12 years of being frozen out by Mr. Bloomberg.\u000a\u000a28. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase\u000a\u000aMr. Dimon is the head of one of those big banks Bernie Sanders is always talking about breaking up, so unsurprisingly he doesn\u2019t think doing so is a great idea. He remains a powerful representative of Wall Street\u2014which is something of an industry non grata in this election cycle but has long held sway over New York\u2019s elected officials, especially Mr. Schumer, to whom Mr. Dimon has donated plenty.\u000a\u000a29. Scott Stringer, Comptroller\u000a\u000aMr. Stringer was among the first city Democratic pols to start going after Mr. de Blasio, and as others have joined in, he\u2019s remained a loud voice thanks to his ability to turn out audits and run investigations. Is it all part of a lead-up to challenging Mr. de Blasio in 2017? It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Stringer is willing to take that risk, but he\u2019s clearly intending to set himself up as a critical voice and perhaps an alternative.\u000a\u000a30. Bill Lipton and Dan Cantor, Co-Founders of the Working Families Party\u000a\u000aAfter backing Mr. Cuomo in 2014 and pissing off its base, the progressive party is getting a redo by going all-in on Bernie Sanders, even as the New York Democratic establishment (and many WFP allies) unite around Ms. Clinton. Were Mr. Sanders to exceed expectations on April 19, expect plenty of accolades for the two men, who have made the labor-backed party a force in New York.\u000a\u000a31. Letitia James, Public Advocate\u000a\u000aThe public advocate has sought to bring her legal experience to the role, filing a slew of lawsuits against various city agencies. Several of them have been tossed out, but that hasn\u2019t slowed down Ms. James\u2019 brand of agitating against the city while also being careful not to do much damage to her friend, Mr. de Blasio. Ms. James has also made a habit of traveling all across the city for events like town halls\u2014a move that might help boost her numbers when she runs for re-election (or perhaps for a higher office).\u000a\u000a32. Shola Olatoye, NYCHA Chairwoman\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of tough jobs in city government, but leading the city\u2019s aging public housing system has got to be one of the very toughest. Ms. Olatoye is tasked with trying to find a way to make the New York City Housing Authority solvent again, and she\u2019ll seek to do so through the Next Generation NYCHA proposal, a controversial plan to lease green space on NYCHA property to private developers.\u000a\u000a33. Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ SEIU\u000a\u000aMr. Figueroa was another player in the major effort to increase the minimum wage in the state, first for fast food workers and then for everyone. He\u2019s also an outspoken advocate of immigration reform and gatekeeper of a union of largely Latino membership that helps sway local elections and endorsed Ms. Clinton for president.\u000a\u000a34. Julissa Ferreras, City Councilwoman\u000a\u000aThe chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s finance committee keeps a relatively low profile, but the Queens lawmaker is quietly one of the most influential council members and a candidate to replace Melissa Mark-Viverito as speaker. Were she to take the reins in 2018, she\u2019d be an automatic mayoral contender.

aVCobie Smulders wants to know where she can rent an RV.\u000a\u000aThe actress, best known for her work on How I Met Your Mother, is currently making her Broadway debut in a revival of Noel Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. But on a recent Monday morning the statuesque brunette was looking ahead to July, when her run ends and she, her husband (Saturday Night Live alum Taran Killam, who\u2019s currently starring in Hamilton) and their two children (ages 2 and 7) head back to California.\u000a\u000aSmulders wants to make the cross-country journey in a trailer, but she\u2019s at a loss for where to begin\u2014until one of her stylists recommends a dealership in Weehawken, New Jersey, at which point Smulders says she\u2019ll \u201cget on that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 34-year-old is no stranger to long road trips. Early in her acting career, she made an annual pilgrimage from her home in Vancouver to Los Angeles to try her luck during TV pilot season (which runs from November to March). She and her Canuck cohorts referred to the trip as the \u201cCanadian migration.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d work in restaurants all year long to make money, and then blow it for three months in L.A. while we were trying to get jobs,\u201d Smulders told the Observer during an interview at the Musket Room, a barn stable turned high-end restaurant in lower Manhattan.\u000a\u000aSmulders participated in theater clubs throughout elementary and high school, and she also briefly moved to New York to pursue her craft\u2014that\u2019s where she saw Rent and first dreamed of being on Broadway.\u000a\u000aBut it was those trips to L.A. that bore the most fruit. Indeed, during Smulders\u2019 third pilot season she landed her breakout role as TV reporter Robin Scherbatsky on How I Met Your Mother. The CBS sitcom debuted in 2005 and ran for nine seasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was one of those magical things that just kept going,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aAmong the most magical parts of it (at least for Smulders) was that her character had a pop star alter ego named Robin Sparkles, whose hits included \u201cLet\u2019s Go to the Mall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of the major complaints for long-running shows is that they become mundane,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cI never felt that way because of stuff like Robin Sparkles.\u201d\u000a\u000aOutside this fantasy world, Robin was the on-again, off-again love interest of both Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Indeed, in the series finale, after the titular mother dies, Ted\u2019s kids convince him to give his relationship with Robin another shot (she and Barney have married and divorced by this point).\u000a\u000aMany fans were disappointed in the way the series wrapped up, and while Smulders disagrees she\u2019s glad that people had strong opinions about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople were really emotionally invested in this show,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful way to end the time we spent together.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmulders\u2019 fan base expanded from comedy fans to comic book fanboys when she was cast as badass S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (and Samuel L. Jackson sidekick) Maria Hill in the Avengers franchise. She met Joss Whedon (director of the first two films) through her Mother co-star Alyson Hannigan.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe humans aren\u2019t as interesting to watch in a battle, but Joss is kind and makes sure every actor has a moment,\u201d said Smulders, who will appear in next summer\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War.\u000a\u000aShe also made waves earlier this year after a mysterious cameo on the Netflix show Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2014the series cut away from the main action several times to show Smulders and Will Arnett handcuffed in the back of a van and exploring Peru, among other adventures. The couple\u2019s entire storyline turned out to be a red herring.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy character didn\u2019t die, so I have no idea what they\u2019re gonna do next season,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs such, Smulders is refocusing on comedy while she stars in Present Laughter, which opens April 5 at the St. James Theatre. And it\u2019s clear her comedic instincts are still strong from her sitcom days\u2014at one point during the photo shoot for this article, she started nibbling on a chili pepper that was sitting on the bar, a sight to make even the most hardened cynic chuckle.\u000a\u000aWhile this is Smulders\u2019 first time on Broadway, she\u2019s been a fan of Coward since the beginning of her career\u2014she performed scenes from his classic Private Lives in acting classes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love the way he uses comedy as a weapon,\u201d Smulders said.\u000a\u000aThe main sharpshooter in Present Laughter is Garry Essendine (played by Oscar and Tony winner Kevin Kline), a celebrated, self-absorbed actor with a voracious libido who\u2019s going through a midlife crisis. Throughout the play he negotiates comic conflicts with his wife, producer, director, secretary and servants, among others.\u000a\u000aSmulders plays Joanna Lyppiatt, who\u2019s married to Garry\u2019s producer but is also infatuated with Garry himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all feel like we can help him in some way or save him in some way or make his life better in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all want to be with him, and we think we know him, so it\u2019s a bit of a game trying to get into the inner circle of this world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaying the game with a formidable opponent like Kline keeps Smulders on her toes\u2014she described him as an \u201cidiot savant\u201d who takes comedy seriously.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe keeps changing and keeping things interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s like water: so fluid, going from one thing to the next. He\u2019s a true artist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same traits apply to Smulders herself, according to Present Laughter director Moritz von Stuelpnagel (a Tony nominee for helming Hand to God).\u000a\u000a\u201cCobie was built for the theater,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cShe\u2019s thoughtful about storytelling and precise in her comedy. It\u2019s been a real joy to watch her take a character that might otherwise descend into a flat archetype and have her flesh the role out with dynamic humanity.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Coward\u2019s fast-paced writing style is similar to the patter on sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother, Smulders said sustaining that rhythm for almost three hours presented a new challenge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing in a 15 minute scene is unlike anything you have to do on film or TV,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Broadway grind of rehearsals and performances has also had an impact on Smulders\u2019 home life, especially since her spouse is in the same boat\u2014Killam is playing King George III in Hamilton through April 13.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously there\u2019s a little bit of a \u2018Who\u2019s getting up first to take care of the kids\u2019 type of situation,\u201d Smulders said. \u201cBut aside from the lack of sleep, it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019re together in ways that we haven\u2019t been before.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe and Killam meet for dinner together on two show days. Smulders admitted she takes advantage of the fact that her future RV partner is in Broadway\u2019s biggest hit.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s a part of it, and by association I feel like I\u2019m a part of it, but maybe that\u2019s just me being greedy,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGreed aside, Smulders said that her time in New York had been \u201ca dream\u201d thus far.\u000a\u000a\u201cI keep fooling people into giving me jobs, and now I\u2019m on Broadway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always something I\u2019ve wanted to be a part of, and I can\u2019t believe that this is the experience I\u2019m having.\u201d

aVIf you\u2019ve ever been to the McKittrick Hotel, the site of Punchdrunk\u2019s immersive theater (and mandatory stop for visiting relatives) Sleep No More, you know it can get creepy at night. But even on an afternoon this summer\u2014empty of all Eyes Wide Shut masks, bellhops lip-syncing to Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d or impromptu nude dance sequence in blood baths\u2014the McKittrick still has a looming, menacing presence. Or maybe I was just nervous. After all, I was there to meet Sigourney Weaver, and a dark, semi-abandoned haunted house might have been the wrong call. Why couldn\u2019t I have picked a well-lit coffee shop to interview the star of all the Aliens and Ghostbusters?\u000a\u000aIf I was skittish, Weaver, already posing for photos when I tentatively tiptoed into an empty bar area, seemed entirely at ease. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget, they have my meat in the freezer,\u201d Weaver reminded no one in particular between poses. \u201cI really can\u2019t forget to take the meat with me when I go.\u201d Directly following our interview, Weaver would be driving back to the Adirondacks, and the possibility of leaving the meat (never clarified as to how much there was of it, or what kind) was causing her more anxiety than a Hitchcockian faux-tel. Weaver\u201468 years old and 6 feet tall without heels\u2014can make herself at home in even the most inhospitable of environments.\u000a\u000aThe notion that Sigourney Weaver is the embodiment of the \u201cDIY and take no shit\u201d authority figure for a generation of young women might sound, in retrospect, like a backhanded compliment. But for those of us who grew up as tomboys in the 80s, Weaver stood as shining beacon of some other way to be. While other girls wanted to be Princess Leia or Jasmine, there were always a few of us who wanted to be Ripley. Or later on, Katharine Parker in Working Girl, a woman so ahead of her time in office politicking that she managed to mash-up Claire Underwood from House of Cards and Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, a solid two decades before either existed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect time to be different,\u201d Weaver tells me on the topic of beauty standards, as we slide into a dark and quiet booth in the red-curtained bar room. \u201cI think it\u2019s our time.\u201d She notes her obsession with watching the Olympics. \u201cYou see the glorious range of what women look like, how strong they are. I think this is all changing on screen, as people want to see themselves reflected a little bit more. They don\u2019t want to see some little stick figure up there all the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat inspired me in the beginning was that Vanessa Redgrave was my height,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee, I guess if they want you, they must want your height.\u2019 Realistically, it protected me from being in more prosaic films, because I was never the little girlfriend. I didn\u2019t get to do a lot of love stories, which I think I would have enjoyed. Mostly I did other kinds of movies and other kinds of stories, partly because I was too tall for traditional roles. So it was really these crazy kind of directors who would look at me and say, \u2018You can do this!\u2019 Sometimes it would even be a man\u2019s role. That I didn\u2019t fit into the traditional mold, I think that\u2019s made my career much more interesting, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, that untraditional mold encompasses more than just Weaver\u2019s height and muscle tone. Born in Manhattan as Susan Alexandra Weaver (she renamed herself \u201cSigourney\u201d in 1965, basing it on a small character from The Great Gatsby) to an actress mother and a TV-producing father, Weaver spent her early years attending a series of private and prep schools before turning 18, when she promptly left for Israel and joined a Kibbutz for several months. When she came back to the states, she attended both Sarah Lawrence and Stanford University. She chalks up a lot of her success to the fact that she was an English major in her undergrad years. \u201cAt Stanford, they had a drama department, which I kind of assiduously avoided, because it did very square things. I joined this group called The Company, and we did outrageous new plays. We did commedia dell\u2019arte in a covered wagon and wandered around the Bay Area. A lot of Shakespeare.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough increasingly comfortable outside mainstream theater culture\u2014for a period of time at Stanford, Weaver dressed like an elf and lived in a tree house\u2014the actress did eventually audition for Yale\u2019s prestigious drama graduate program. She showed up to her appointment in a long sheet, tied off with a belt made out of rope, and proceeded to knit together three speeches from Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Saint Joan of the Stockyards. (One day, I would like to produce a line of dolls and accessories for children based on Sigourney Weaver. Not her in character, just Sigourney: She\u2019ll come with her own toga and tree house and well-worn copy of Threepenny Opera, but the car with a trunk carrying a month\u2019s worth of ice-packed sirloin is sold separately.)\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually had a difficult time [at Yale], because they took everything so seriously,\u201d Weaver recalls. \u201cThey gave you your own dressing room. It seemed so lonely to me. Everyone was so competitive. I thought, I really miss my friends, and having everyone do their makeup up in the same little piece of cracked mirror in the back of someone\u2019s truck.\u201d Weaver had to wait until she\u2019d graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1974 before she could recover her sense of community by performing in Off-Broadway shows.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, many of the films Weaver works on tend to have directors that cultivate a similar comrade-in-arms mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re illegitimate films,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201cBut for instance, I just worked with Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie), and we just did this crazy film in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was nothing you\u2019ve heard of. But it was really cool, like his version of a student film. It was really guerrilla filmmaking. It was two takes and move on. I just love working that way.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater, I will crosscheck her name with Blomkamp\u2019s to see what \u201chis version of a student film\u201d looks like. The movie turns out to be Alien 5.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s surprising to hear Sigourney Weaver talk about her legacy as a feminist movie icon. For beginners, she doesn\u2019t like to think of herself as a genre actress, even though she\u2019s associated with so many tough-as-nails sci-fi heroines.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think genres are very misleading,\u201d she says, almost reproachfully. \u201cRemember, I was an English major, so it was always about the story for me. I never cared what the role was, whether it was big or small.\u201d Same goes for movie franchises: Though she\u2019s a part of the culture, she holds herself at a distance from the Hollywood machine that churns out reboots, sequels and spinoffs with alarming frequency.\u000a\u000a\u2018All good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u2019\u2014 Sigourney Weaver\u000a\u000a\u201cSee, I\u2019m from the very old world, where setting out to make a franchise is a very bad idea,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think when you start off from the idea of a movie being part of a franchise, you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. You have to start with one really good script and really good characters. Women have probably suffered, because people have tried to do the franchise thing. You have to find a role, that, whether played by a man or a woman, would be a really compelling character.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all good stories have good women\u2019s parts.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat said, Weaver is now attached to another Aliens film along with the upcoming Avatar sequels. \u201cLook, franchises have to be earned,\u201d she stresses. \u201cI know a lot of agents are telling young people nowadays to attach themselves to one. In the old days, that\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019d want, to be locked into a contract like that, for just one role. I\u2019m sure young people are just trying to be in movies. But sometimes even a little tiny movie can go around the world. And then, you see, you can have more of a say in it, should your little movie become a franchise. But first, you need to have a really great writer. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be put together by Hollywood people, adding a little this and that. I just don\u2019t think that works.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver is equally dismissive of the American film industry writ large. \u201cI never really feel like I went to Hollywood,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when I did actually go there, for a film like Ghostbusters, which was a big film by Universal, it was really our story that we were telling, and it felt like it belonged to us.\u201d On the opposite end of the spectrum from the work she\u2019s most well known for are some of her favorite roles, in underrated films like Scott Elliott\u2019s A Map of the World. Or 2006\u2019s Snow Cake, where she got to play opposite Alan Rickman. \u201cOften, when you sell a film to Harvey Weinstein and it\u2019s good,\u201d\u2014Weaver lets down her polished persona for a moment in a flash of teeth that could as easily be a puckish smile as a conspiratorial grimace\u2014\u201che just doesn\u2019t distribute it.\u201d\u000a\u000aEither way, Weaver figures, the old model of movies is on its way to extinction. \u201cThe Hollywood thing is going to be a dinosaur very soon.\u201d People are making and distributing movies on leaner budgets, and releasing them online, without the help of a major studio for distribution. \u201cIt\u2019s already happening, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great.\u201d\u000a\u000aWeaver\u2019s latest role is in A Monster Calls, which is itself a pretty uncategorizable genre-blend. Ostensibly a kid\u2019s movie (though it\u2019s hard to imagine what child could walk out of the film without being traumatized) based on the \u201clow fantasy\u201d novel by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls takes the messaging of a John Green story and dresses it up in the psychedelic, phantasmagorical guise of a Heavenly Creatures or Pan\u2019s Labyrinth. Liam Neeson is the voice of a talking tree monster that is not Groot, though you could be forgiven for confusing the two. The titular tree monster is summoned to help a young boy Conor (Lewis MacDougall) deal with the impending death of his young mother. (A truly emaciated Felicity Jones, who we can at least agree is having a much better time in this holiday\u2019s other blockbuster escapist hit, Rogue One.) Weaver plays Conor\u2019s British grandmother, a woman who takes the concept of \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d a little too far. When Conor is forced to come live with her, we see that his grandmother has taken the same approach toward interior design: her living room filled with breakable knickknacks and irreplaceable family heirlooms. When Conor, in a fit of fantasy rage (portrayed in beautiful watercolor animation, to differentiate it from the \u201creal\u201d world) reduces the room to shards and splinters, he only has a moment to savor his destruction before hearing the key in the lock. Grandmother\u2019s home.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a testament to both the nuance of the character and Weaver\u2019s portrayal of her that the scene feels like it lasts a lifetime. Without saying a word, Weaver\u2019s eyes widen and waver as she daintily crunches through the wreckage until she comes to the one piece of furniture left untouched. Only then does she bare her teeth and let\u2019s us see the big bad wolf inside, howling in wordless rage and frustration as she deals out the fatal blow to the literal and metaphorical semblance of structure in her life. Then, still mute, she leaves the room, never once looking at Conor, who is screaming apologies and excuses all the while.\u000a\u000aLater, the boy will hear her sobbing in the bathroom, the door locked.\u000a\u000aDespite holding her own no less formidable opponents as ghosts, extraterrestrial slime monsters and even Jennifer Love Hewitt (Heartbreakers, anyone?), there\u2019s something so primal that Weaver tapped into when confronted by the young boy\u2019s outburst. In that moment, I didn\u2019t know if I was terrified of Weaver\u2019s grandmother or for her. The scariest possibility? Probably both.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly? I end up doing a lot of big movies, and I so wanted to do something very small and intimate and very dramatic,\u201d says Weaver on her decision to take the part, adding that she had been interested in working with director J.A. Bayona after seeing two of his films, The Orphanage and The Impossible. \u201cThe story really catches at your heart,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s not a film about cancer but about coming to terms with loss. I just knew Bayona would create something very original and so personal.\u201d\u000a\u000aSigourney Weaver is in a rush to get back upstate, so I remind her to take her frozen meat before asking her my one super-fan question: Did she ever find movies that she starred in too scary?\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, often!\u201d She laughs. \u201cWatching the Alien movies\u2026when you\u2019re on set, acting, you don\u2019t realize the sounds they are going to be adding later. It really does a number on you, when you\u2019re watching it as an audience member.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my scariest role?\u201d Weaver pauses. \u201cMy character in Copycat was completely nuts.\u201d This was her turn as an agoraphobic psychologist in Jon Amiel\u2019s 1995 psychological thriller. (Surprisingly, as I found out, not based on a Thomas Harris novel!) Sigourney Weaver, a.k.a. Ripley, a.k.a. one of the toughest women in the biz, stands up and shudders. \u201cThat woman? She just scared the hell out of me.\u201d
p46
aVIf you are standing right now, I suggest you sit down, because we\u2019re going to begin with some truly shocking news: Aubrey Plaza is not a 50-year-old man.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, this should be clear to anyone who has followed Plaza on her rise to stardom over the years\u2014the seven seasons portraying the human embodiment of an eye-roll, April Ludgate, on NBC\u2019s Parks & Recreation, her quieter standout roles in indies like Safety Not Guaranteed and Ned Rifle, or more recent big-screen endeavors like Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates. Certainly, it\u2019s clear to me, sitting across from the actress at a Los Feliz noodle bar, a month before she\u2019s set to co-star in Legion, FX\u2019s Marvel-universe mind-bender from Fargo creator Noah Hawley.\u000a\u000aBut is it clear to Hawley? Harder to say. In the original pilot script for Legion, Hawley wrote the character of Lenny Busker as a male, middle-aged former drug-addict, the resident, older sage of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, providing both optimism and advice to our mutant main character David Haller (Dan Stevens). The question becomes, What made the writer-director, after a single meeting with Plaza, decide the 32-year-old actress would be a perfect fit for the part?\u000a\u000a\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she says and laughs, before changing tact. \u201cI mean, no, I get it. I think that maybe that\u2019s my real, underneath persona, and at heart, I\u2019m like a 50-year-old drug addict living in a mental hospital. And Noah saw that\u2019s who I am, really, underneath it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a typical answer from Plaza. You often don\u2019t realize she\u2019s joking until halfway through a sentence, and by then it turns into a game of catch-up with an Upright Citizens Brigade veteran. But it\u2019s not a cold-shoulder thing, either, not a heightened social awkwardness. Despite what every interview with the actress written between 2009 and 2015 would have you believe, she\u2019s not actually April Ludgate. The first order of business she suggests after sitting down is that we take a C-Shot together. Despite having no idea what a C-Shot is, I agree. \u201cGreat, let\u2019s just go crazy,\u201d she replies, stone-faced.\u000a\u000a\u201cCrazy,\u201d as it turns out, is an apropos way to begin any conversation over Legion. Any viewer expecting the formulaic blueprint of your typical Marvel blockbuster\u2014the family tragedy, the unwilling hero, the British thespian hamming it up as the villain, etcetera, etcetera\u2014is likely to come away disappointed or, at least, plenty confused.\u000a\u000aThe character of David Haller has been around in paper-and-ink form since 1985 when writer Chris Claremont and artist Bill Sienkiewicz brought him to life in New Mutants #25. The son of chrome-domed psychic Charles Xavier (a spoiler for the comics but not, as far as I know, the show), Haller is the human equivalent of an overbooked hotel; his mutant ability is essentially a heightened form of dissociative identity disorder, formerly known by its cruder term \u201csplit personality,\u201d with each unique persona adding to a deafening cacophony of separate abilities.\u000a\u000aWith Legion, Hawley has taken this idea\u2014what if you were several \u201cyous\u201d somehow simultaneously\u2014and translated it to the small screen in a way that is not only immersive and exciting but, at times, overwhelmingly confusing. Characters jump timelines and swap bodies. Reality often shifts, without warning, or gives way completely to another layer underneath, and on at least one occasion, that layer is a synchronized dance number. To wit, Legion is weird\u2014and unlike anything Marvel has done before.\u000a\u000aAnd through it all\u2014the confusion, complexity and chaos\u2014the one constant remains Plaza\u2019s blood-shot Lenny Busker. \u201cMy goal was for Lenny to be the happy place for David, at all times,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaving that to focus on, with all that other bad stuff lingering in the background for me, was a good combination. It helped me play the character as someone fighting against the bad stuff and allowed it to be more than just, \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m so crazy. I\u2019m like, totally tweaking out.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat border, between comic-book storytelling and the reality of mental illness, is where Legion walks its finest line. After all, the series\u2019 main thesis, spouted from inside a psychiatric hospital, is that occasionally the illness is your strength, and more dangerously, the voices in your head might be telling some form of truth. In a scene from the pilot, David, Lenny and newcomer Syd (Rachel Keller) sit in support group, while a doctor grills them on their respective problems. \u201cWhat if your problems are in your head?\u201d Syd asks. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not even problems?\u201d\u000a\u000aLenny, who until then is too busy grooving to oversized headphones to participate, leans forward. \u201cI like you,\u201d she says, eyes wide. \u201cYou got what the kids these days call \u2018moxie.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI liked the idea, and I think Noah really likes the idea, of having Lenny be this optimist despite the challenges she\u2019s facing,\u201d Plaza tells me. \u201cYou have this character in a mental hospital. She\u2019s a drug addict. She pretty much has everything possible going wrong for her. But she\u2019s the one making jokes, to cheer David up, to be the bright light in it all. That was interesting to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith that, our C-Shots arrived, a mixture of cayenne pepper and lemon that, very much like Legion, is simultaneously refreshing and hard to swallow. We drink. I cough. She does not.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s entirely plausible that the reason Hawley saw Lenny Busker as fluid is Plaza herself, as a character actress, is nearly impossible to typecast down. Every move post-Parks, even across from Robert De Niro in the critically maligned yet financially successful Dirty Grandpa, has looked like a move away from an April Ludgate-shaped trap, marked with that dreaded qualifier, \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This, Plaza tells me, is deliberate. \u201cThere was definitely a time where people couldn\u2019t see beyond April Ludgate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in playing all different types of parts, and getting those parts are hard when people put you in a box.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwo Plaza-starring features debuted at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, as different as they were successful. The first, Ingrid Goes West, is part social media satire, part twisted road-trip film. Plaza, who also served as producer, plays Ingrid, an Instagram-obsessive who moves across the country to befriend social-celebrity Ingrid Sloane (played by Marvel peer Elizabeth Olsen, of Avengers fame). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a social media commentary, but it\u2019s not really about that,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about human relationships, and human connections, and how some people have a really hard time making them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA phenomenon, to prove there is no limit to art imitating life, that Plaza knows all too well. A few days prior to our conversation, the actress deleted her Twitter account (@EvilHag, of course), an act nearly blasphemous in the age of instant information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a long time coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like it made sense to do it right before the new year started, some kind of lame way of saying, \u2018Fuck it, I don\u2019t care anymore.\u2019 I realized that it was adding nothing positive to my life. It was unhealthy. It just bummed me out, honestly.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza\u2019s second Sundance offering is, well, a little harder to explain, 140 characters or not, even for the actress herself. The Little Hours, Plaza\u2019s third collaboration with writer-director Jeff Baena, has so many conflicting personalities it could star in Legion. At once a faithful adaptation of 14th-Century novella collection The Decameron and a raunchy comedy, the film sees Plaza playing a nun but not really, she warns, without further explanation. But yes, a nun (kind of), forced to live in a convent in the age of the Bubonic Plague. \u201cIt\u2019s almost academic. I think colleges would show it to explain that time period,\u201d Plaza says. \u201cIf, you know, it wasn\u2019t so fucked up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlong with starring beside the likes of John C. Reilly, Alison Brie and Dave Franco, Plaza was put on prayer duty; that is to say, Baena asked the Catholic born-and-raised actress to ensure The Little Hours\u2019 dialogue, in between the countless \u201cfucks,\u201d was as Biblically accurate as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was kind of funny because I was working on Legion, which is a very different thing, a very dark thing,\u201d Plaza remembers, \u201cand I kept switching from that to literally reading the Bible at night. I, like, stole the Bible from my hotel room.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd as she reads, she remembers: memories, she tells me, of a childhood in a Catholic home, of leading mass as cantor, of Bible study and even of her very first paying job working the front desk of a convent attached to her all-girls high school. \u201cI just sat there and answered phone calls, mainly from the shoe cobbler who would have the nuns\u2019 shoes nice and cobbled.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing really crazy happened. I wish I had a scandalous nun story for you,\u201d she continues. I point out the cosmic irony of, decades later, playing a nun herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Plaza smiles. A few weeks later, reviews pour out of Sundance for The Little Hours, focusing primarily on sacramental wine chugging, chastity-vow breaking and a particular scene in which Plaza pelts a man with radishes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make them all so proud.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza began her 2017 with a dance. As the clock struck midnight on December 31, the actress, her Twitter deleted, Legion set to debut in two months, had a single resolution. \u201cMy goal was to start a legit dance party,\u201d she tells me.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had a massive New Year\u2019s Eve party at my house, about 200 people,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe packed it in. There was one point, right before midnight, there were so many people there you couldn\u2019t move. It was a fire hazard. And I wanted to get everyone to a dance floor.\u201d\u000a\u000aPlaza keeps herself busy with work\u2014\u201cI only act,\u201d she tells me, a statement that remains true well into 2017\u2014and doesn\u2019t really do New Year\u2019s Resolutions, or, at least, can think of none off the top of her head. Which makes this single objective, in the middle of a packed house, a unique one.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were playing all of the songs you want to hear\u2014Bowie, Prince, George Michael\u2014we were trying to do a whole, \u2018Can you fucking believe what happened in 2016?\u2019 playlist. But then I just was like, We gotta get some Chance the Rapper and start getting down and dirty with it. I felt there was kind of an energy to that party where everyone was just like, \u2018Ugh, I want to dance off 2016, get it out and start over.\u2019 That\u2019s all I wanted, and it happened, right after midnight.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was,\u201d she continues, \u201cwhat the kids these days call \u2018a rager.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aListening back over the interview audio later, things clicked into place right there, mostly, I imagine, because Plaza borrowed a phrase from her own character, Lenny Busker, the aforementioned \u201cwhat the kids these days call\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aNot to presume I understand Noah Hawley\u2014there are still parts of Legion I couldn\u2019t describe, even on a good day\u2014but on one particular point, I could attempt a guess. What did he see in Plaza, in one meeting, that made her the perfect fit for Lenny Busker? Let her tell you a story over one interview, over one meeting, and the matter of gender and age fall away; instead, you see there is no difference, really, between the woman who looked at a year of darkness, death and uncertainty and thought first of a dance-floor, and Lenny Busker, the eternal optimist in oversized headphones, lighting the way through the mental asylum.

aV\u201cThe amazing thing about La Perla is we do lingerie, nightwear and sleepwear, so we can encompass your entire life. From the time you wake up in your pajamas, go to the office wearing our suits, to evening wear and then back to your nighty, we encompass it all,\u201d La Perla\u2019s creative director Julia Haart explained, while curled up in a round leather booth in the Lamb\u2019s Club. The designer was wearing a red zip-up hoodie and an insanely high pair of heeled boots of her own design.\u000a\u000aIt was a chilly February morning, directly following the designer\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 runway extravaganza, where Naomi Campbell donned a silky nighty, Lindsey Wixson walked in a bright purple bralette, Sasha Pivovarova rocked a plaid skirt suit, and Kendall Jenner closed the show in a nearly see-through gown. The models lounged on the couches, chairs and balconies, in a number of different rooms of the \u201cLa Perla Manor\u201d set, before descending a grand staircase and strutting the runway. Taking place on the first day of New York Fashion Week, this grand gesture was an impressive way to start off the season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked the casting agent Piergiorgio [Del Moro] for diversity. I do not want to see 40 white girls, that\u2019s not the world we live in and that\u2019s not the people I want to sell to. I want to dress every woman. I also wanted women with personality. Don\u2019t just give me beautiful women; give me sexy, fun, confident, strong women!\u201d she explained.\u000a\u000aPerhaps Vogue said it best in their runway review. \u201cShe is presumably catering to those women that might tune into the Victoria\u2019s Secret show (as it happens, a number of her Fall cast are also Angels) but would never actually buy Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014all La Perla, all the way,\u201d they wrote. Surely, the Victoria\u2019s Secret formula is there: world-class models, an over-the-top set and plenty of lacy lingerie. But there was more.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very honored, it\u2019s very lovely,\u201d Haart replied, when asked about the comparison. \u201cThe only thing is that Victoria\u2019s Secret is a lingerie show, mine was a ready-to-wear show, so that\u2019s comparing apples and oranges. We may have come from a lingerie background but we have taken it to the next level.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s true. La Perla is a go-to for sexy lace bras and barely there underwear with luxury price tags, but they also offer slinky evening gowns and blazers with wireless bra cups built in. Not only do you factor in your clothing size with a La Perla ready-to-wear purchase, but your bra size is considered, too. Have you ever bought a jacket in a size 38 cup AB? Or a shirt in a 44 cup CD?\u000a\u000aHowever, the starring roles belong to the fabrics used by the company, these firm foundations are truly something to marvel over. Haart has incorporated stretch into nearly every material, offering a silk dress with 10 percent Elastane that is wrinkle-resistant. She has also developed a fine stretch-lace that actually moves with the body. Haart wants women to feel as comfortable in their clothing as they feel in their lingerie. She doesn\u2019t believe that women should have to choose between looking good and feeling comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll of my materials have stretch, so you can literally kickbox in everything,\u201d she semi-joked. \u201cNot that you\u2019re necessarily going to want to kickbox in an evening gown, but if the mood instructs you\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAppointed to the creative director role in August 2016, it is clear that the buxom but petite Haart knows a thing or two about finding flattering clothing to fit her frame. She had actually worked with the brand before this past summer; advising the team on two accessories collaborations, starting with the Fall/Winter 2016 season.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had my own shoe line, so I first started making shoes for La Perla, as a collaboration. Then it was \u2018Julia can you design handbags?\u2019 And \u2018Julia can you design men\u2019s shoes?\u2019 Eventually, \u2018Can you help with the collection?\u2019 And here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince being installed in this top creative role, Haart has cemented her status as a power player. In December, she co-hosted a celebration for a Goop pop-up in Santa Monica. Gwyneth Paltrow showed up to the dinner in a black corset suit and leggings from La Perla (Ms. P also made a rare front row appearance at the brand\u2019s February fashion show).\u000a\u000aLa Perla also co-sponsored Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2018s Los Angeles celebration of the 150 Most Fashionable Women in January 2017, where Haart appeared on the red carpet sandwiched between Kendall Jenner and Liu Wen (who, if you recall, both walked in recent fashion shows for Victoria\u2019s Secret and La Perla). These two models also starred in the latest La Perla ad campaign, donning suits in celestial prints, dresses decorated with sultry lace and corset details; they shared the campaign with Isabeli Fontana. Shot by Steven Klein and artistically directed by Fabien Baron, this was Haart\u2019s inaugural campaign for the brand. The theme behind the shoot? \u201cThe liberation of every woman from the need to suffer for beauty,\u201d of course. Despite the clothing, the ads still offer a little something for the lingerie fans faithful to the brand since its inception in 1954.\u000a\u000aAlso promoting the ready-to-wear range was the brand\u2019s new Milan flagship, which opened this past fashion week. Located on via Montenapoleone, the new marble-clad store doubled in size, spanning 2,583 square feet over two floors. Haart admitted that the moving to a bigger store was necessary for accommodating her expanded clothing collections. This is understandable when you realize her Fall/Winter 2017 collection contained a whopping 225 pieces.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone keeps asking me \u2018Who is the La Perla woman?\u2019 And I hate that question so much. Who am I to determine what a woman should look like?\u201d Haart expressed in exasperation, back in New York. She went on to explain that she is not precious about how say, a stylist might dress an actress in her designs, many of which are simple tailored staples. She is unconcerned if her looks are paired with other brands, she just wants the La Perla pieces to look good. Haart has set out to dress every woman, to help them embrace their curves and the make them feel comfortable.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to make women feel more confident with themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to look in the mirror and say damn I look fine. That\u2019s my only job.

aVYou may have a cleaner mind after yoga class, but your workout clothes are a playground for dirty, dirty microbes that defy traditional detergents.\u000a\u000aBlame the odor on gas-producing bacteria, says Lee Silverman, managing director of WIN laundry detergent. Silverman explains the basic science behind smelly Lululemons: oil and water don\u2019t mix. Cotton T-shirt fibers are rope-like, with lots of nooks and crannies\u2014perfect for absorbing H2O and deflecting body oil. High-tech performance gear, on the other hand, is made of smooth synthetic tubes, similar to fishing line, that deflect water and allow sweat to evaporate off the skin. Chemicals in this fabric make clothing \u201chydrophobic,\u201d fearful of water and perspiration. This \u201cwicking\u201d translates into a cooler workout with less friction on the skin. But it also means fabric absorbs body oils, the first event in a foul-smelling melodrama.\u000a\u000aOver time, your favorite workout clothes can become the perfect setting for \u201cGerms Gone Wild,\u201d especially if garments live in dark, warm places like gym bags and lockers. Laundry detergents like Tide, which effectively pull stains and odors out of cotton, really don\u2019t work on sports clothes that require simple, alternative treatments to remove sweat.\u000a\u000a\u201cFifteen years ago, a person might have had one or two pieces of performance wear,\u201d Silverman says. \u201cToday active people have as many as 15 pieces of athleisure, which means a lot of laundry.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere are four tricks to washing the sweat from your high-tech workout clothes, for a less smelly summer:\u000a\u000aRinse athleisure pieces immediately after use. No one preaches this louder than Anina Young, owner of Brazen Lingerie in New York City, who feels personally insulted when clients don\u2019t respect their sports bras. \u201cTake care of your girls and they\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d she often tells customers. After soaking workout clothes in plain water, Young recommends pressing the items between two hands to remove excess moisture. Do not twist or wring your workout clothes, which can damage the material and make it less supportive. Do laundry once a week. Just like you separate whites from colors, you need to treat workout clothes as its own animal with its own time in the washer. While traditional laundry detergent removes odors and grass stains from cotton, that same soap won\u2019t de-stink synthetic gym clothes. Silverman suggests sport-specific products like WIN instead of Tide to remove sweat and body oils. Young likes Soak , a laundry detergent that doesn\u2019t require rinsing. For delicate items like bathing suits and sports bras, the soap is ideal for hand-washing intimates in the sink. Homemade once-a-week remedies include putting all workout clothes into a tub of water with one cup of white vinegar, two teaspoons hydrogen peroxide and two teaspoons baking soda. Let the brew soak for an hour before dumping all gym gear into the washing machine with one cup of white vinegar and two tablespoons of baking soda. Whatever you do, think dry. Odor-causing bacteria thrive in the damp, so don\u2019t let your sweaty clothes ferment in the hamper. At the very least, hang your shorts up after a run. When you have time to machine wash your workout clothes, tumble dry them on low, says Silverman. Do not use dryer sheets, which can destroy wicking properties. Cotton gym clothes should be dried on high. For delicates, air dry by hanging garments on a regular hanger on the shower curtain road. If ventilation is poor, put the hanger on the knob of an open kitchen drawer and catch the drips with a towel on the floor. Alternate your gym clothes. Instead of wearing the same sweaty shirt every day, extend the life of your garments by buying several. Buy two of the same sports bra and rotate them, Young says, adding that fuller-breasted women may benefit from three bras for reasons beyond smell. Supportive fabric gets stretched during intense exercise. As a result, the fibers need time to recover between workouts. The morale of this bosomy tale is that three bras are better than one when it comes to performance and stench. The same holds true of other malodorous clothing like bike shorts and jock straps.\u000a\u000aAnn Votaw is a freelance writer in New York who has a M.A. in Health Education. She teaches yoga and physical fitness to adults 60 and better.

aVBack in 2006, I used to work for a non-profit in Philadelphia that leased mini-vans to drive groups of people in the city out to jobs on big corporate campuses in the suburbs. They called it \u201cCommuter Options.\u201d A lot of the best employers had abandoned the city and set up shop in places that really couldn\u2019t be reached by the regional transit agency\u2019s trains, which meant that workers without cars in the urban core couldn\u2019t take jobs they qualified for because the commute was impossible.\u000a\u000aThe staff who ran the program (I had nothing to do with it directly) didn\u2019t have fancy algorithms or datasets to work with. They just made a lot of phone calls to companies to find workers who needed carpools, and they ran a lot of events to help unemployed city residents apply to suburban jobs. It was slow going, but eventually minivans full of workers were setting out from different neighborhoods every day to remote office parks.\u000a\u000aEight years later, Chariot launched a tech-infused version of a very similar program in San Francisco: find workers in urban transit deserts and get them to the places where the jobs are, thereby saving them a lot of time and probably money, too. Ford liked the idea, so it bought Chariot in 2016. Today it announced its third market, New York City.\u000a\u000aIn May, we reported on Chariot workers in the Bay Area joining the Teamsters union.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want to connect people more easily to where they want to go\u2014whether they need help making it to a transit hub or live in an area underserved by public transportation,\u201d CEO Ali Vahabzadeh said in a press release. It will begin in August with two pre-planned service areas in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at a flat cost of $4 per ride.\u000a\u000aAt a press event today in Manhattan, Vahabzadeh emphasized that its program has been approved by the relevant agencies so that workers can pay for rides out of pre-tax earnings, just like many do for their monthly subway passes.\u000a\u000aThat daily price runs a lot higher than even paying full price for the subway, but there are tens of thousands of New Yorkers who drive to work for one reason or another, and $160 per month is a lot less than most people\u2019s car payment, never mind insurance, parking and gas. The CEO said that KPMG has estimated every Chariot van takes 10 cars off the road.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to really re-envision what a commute should be like,\u201d Vahabzadeh said at the event. Now that it\u2019s part of Ford, it can experiment with how its Ford Transit minibus is set up. Do they want to rearrange the seats? Let them move? Add new entertainment features? Vahabzadeh calls this \u201cCX\u201d for \u201cCabin Experience.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe company has a lot more CX flexibility now. That said, it\u2019s probably going to hew closely to what Vahabzadeh told the San Francisco Business Times in 2015: \u201cAt the end of the day, a commuter wants to get to work quickly, reliably and affordably. Everything else is a distraction.\u201d\u000a\u000aRight now, Chariot really wants New Yorkers to download its app and start playing around. It hopes to crowdsource data about new routes to launch. It wants 60 Transit minibuses running through the city by the end of the year.\u000a\u000aIn ridesharing, it hasn\u2019t been riders that have made the news so much as workers, however. Drivers are not considered employees by the big ridesharing companies, and then when Juno launched in New York, promising a better deal, it reneged shortly thereafter, leaving many drivers feeling used. A lawsuit is underway now.\u000a\u000a\u201cChariot actually employs its drivers,\u201d Vahabzadeh emphasized at the event. He cited a 91 percent retention rate month over month. While acknowledging that many drivers in the tech economy have been frustrated, \u201cour employees say and act differently,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aDriving can be a weird job. Those doing it for Silicon Valley bus companies serving campuses like Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s find themselves navigating very weird split shifts, where they are stuck far from home between their morning and evening runs. Chariot workers do split shifts as well, Vahabzadeh confirmed, but if they are staying within New York City, it shouldn\u2019t be quite so disruptive to their lives.\u000a\u000aTech\u2019s stabs at transit have already changed cities.\u000a\u000aPhiladelphia bus riders\u2014served by the same transit agency that failed city residents with jobs in the suburbs when I was there\u2014have started making the occasional switch to Uber, Philly.com reported this week. These problems are very complicated. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take everything\u201d to get the roads unstuck, Ford\u2019s Jessica Robinson told the Observer at today\u2019s event.\u000a\u000aFord has committed to untying the Gordian knot of urban traffic, as we\u2019ve previously reported. Robinson said Ford really looks at Chariot\u2019s vehicles as a platform. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other innovation that will come to the Chariot platform first,\u201d she told us. That could be new sensors, connectivity or amenities.\u000a\u000aIn particular, she looks forward to a more demand-responsive platform. Imagine if Chariot had enough users and vans that the routes changed a bit every day, depending on who was going to work and when? And if it could deliver similar service to big events, like sporting events and concerts? Not only would that deliver a really flexible commute for riders, but it would also take a ton of pressure off the city\u2019s clogged roadways.\u000a\u000aThat is, until robots start delivering toilet paper and pizzas and clog everything back up again.

aV\u201cLook there\u2019s Anna Faris. She\u2019s always here!\u201d My friend Kelly nodded over to the dairy section of the Trader Joe\u2019s off Sunset in West Hollywood. Stars! They really are just like us. It was December in Los Angeles. Faris was inconspicuously shopping in a T-shirt and shorts, sans hubby Chris Pratt and their child. She was buying yogurt. No, I do not remember what kind, but I wanted to know. I wanted her celebrity diet secrets. What kind of milk does she drink? Is she buying dairy, almond or soy? So many questions. I would not be that person in the grocery store who would barrage a celebrity for diet secrets. So that was that, and there is my run-in with Anna Faris. Far from exciting, but humanizing to see her shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s. This was a woman who had good taste in food, and cared about saving money on groceries.\u000a\u000aI envy celebrity couples. Particularly the female counterparts of many of these matches, with their svelte figures and botoxed faces that look forever young in a natural, non-plastic way. I\u2019d love to be part of a power couple. I admire the actresses who have dared to get behind the camera, as Faris has. I\u2019ve always had a thing for Anna. She\u2019s underrated and has been for years. With producing credits for What\u2019s Your Number and The House Bunny, she\u2019s more than just an on-screen presence. More recently, with her podcast Unqualified and a forthcoming book of the same name, she\u2019s shown she\u2019s not just a pretty face. It was less than a year ago that she was live-tweeting Chris Pratt\u2019s day of preparation for the Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2 premiere. I wanted to vomit at the cuteness of it\u2014chronicling their seemingly normal, day-in-the-life routine for a red carpet night. With that adorable, archived moment stored online for the world to forever see, who could imagine that they\u2019d both be announcing the end of their relationship in coinciding social media posts just months later?\u000a\u000aPeople always seem to be in shock when a celebrity relationship doesn\u2019t work out. Most humans are in shock when their neighbors break up. This is mainly because everything seems so perfectly happy on social media.\u000a\u000aBut when I witness any breakups online, civilian or celeb, I\u2019m not surprised at all. No matter what their feed has ever led me to believe. I\u2019ve been there myself.\u000a\u000aOnly a few days before I left my ex, we had a witty exchange on Facebook. He posted something cute on my wall, I obligingly responded. I was on autopilot, and corresponding as I would to anyone.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s easy to appear happy on the internet. It takes only a few seconds to \u201clike\u201d or post an affectionate photo. What\u2019s not easy is couples therapy, or dealing with the issues that can take months to work out.\u000a\u000aHave you ever seen a status update that has said: \u201cWeek eight: another day of therapy with George\u2026this may not work out.\u201d What about an Instagram post of an angry couple, post-fight? It\u2019s doubtful.\u000a\u000aIf anything, they\u2019ll share moments from happier times to overcompensate for what\u2019s lacking in real life. That is, right up until everything breaks, when people quite often go silent. In my flailing marriage, a little while before we ended things, I noticed my husband\u2019s more frequent habit of tagging me in photos from our happier times together, as if that would somehow magically solve our problems. The situation was sad. A happy emoji or picture couldn\u2019t make up for the emotions that were laking in our real lives. And it added to the appearance that things were fine, when they weren\u2019t.\u000a\u000aSocial media can become a tabloid about your friends\u2019 personal lives. Sure, we half fill it with political and celebrity dirt, but the most exciting kind of gossip comes from the people we know. One would sooner get-off on a Facebook post from a cousin announcing a breakdown than another installment in the saga of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian. Why? Because the cousin is far more relatable\u2014existing in our real lives. You can actually reach out and ask what happened, or your can get the dirt from your family if that\u2019s the kind of thing you thrive off of. Many do. But it can also be a way of knowing when to reach out, when to provide a caring ear for a friend going through something hard.\u000a\u000aSo I learned the hard way, by going through a breakup, how authentic to be with my online persona. I\u2019d say I\u2019m more transparent now, but also more careful about how much I share.\u000a\u000aBased on my past mistakes, I\u2019m hesitant to post anything on social media regarding any new romantic relationships I enter, at least for now. I know it\u2019s just fodder for gossip\u2014I\u2019d rather share that information in person. And now I also realize, things must be going well if I\u2019m not really concerned about posting at all. That means I\u2019m focussed on reality, rather than crafting some kind of story for the world to see.\u000a\u000aOne of the hardest things about modern day romance is how it all sticks around. You can\u2019t simply rip up the newspaper containing your wedding announcement like you used to after going through a divorce. We all leave internet footprints that many times cannot be erased. Post-divorce, as I was chatting with the man who wrote about my wedding ceremony for The New York Times, he brought up an outstanding point.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people ask for those wedding announcements to be taken offline when things go wrong, but that\u2019s what you deal with now. The marriage may not last forever, but the evidence of it will linger online.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese days, the information is there whether you like it or not. Last month Chris Pratt was tweeting about aloha shirts, and now he and his ex are tweeting about the end of their marriage. But their honesty seems like the right approach. Getting the truth out about the reality of what\u2019s happening can feel as if a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders. You no longer have to pretend. It\u2019s a relief when you can finally breathe and let the truth out, no matter how much you fear disappointing people or being the subject of gossip. Some will just talk, but for us non-famous folk, friends for whom this is news might also reach out to let you know you have support. Celebrities or not, breakups are not fun to go through, especially alone.

aVLast Tuesday, L.A.-based sandwich shop Fat Sal\u2019s sent out a short and sly tweet, hinting that its new Encino location might have its soft opening for the public on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday morning, there was a line around the block. And it\u2019s been there every day since. It was 92 degrees in the Valley when I visited on Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop dozens of sweaty people from waiting half an hour to get a sandwich.\u000a\u000aFat Sal\u2019s is known for insane sandwiches that are loaded with deli meats, French fries, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks and other gut-altering ingredients. The restaurant\u2019s most popular sandwich is the Fat Texas, which contains BBQ pastrami brisket, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon, grilled onions, melted cheddar and mozzarella, fries, mayo and honey BBQ sauce on a garlic hero. I really dig the second most popular sandwich, the Fat Jerry, with thinly sliced rib eye, grilled onions, melted American cheese, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon, fried eggs, fries, mayo, ketchup and salt and pepper on a hero.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I always tell the customer is that you read the ingredients in the sandwiches and it sounds overwhelming and messy,\u201d Fat Sal\u2019s co-founder Sal Capek says. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe restaurant\u2019s famed Fat sandwiches are wonders of engineering. They hold together astoundingly well. It might sound crazy to say they\u2019re nicely balanced, but they\u2019re actually not as heavy as you might think\u2014they come on extra-wide bread with a light, fluffy interior that absorbs all the proteins, Capek points out.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look at the cross-section of our sandwiches, it almost looks like a burrito,\u201d Capek says.\u000a\u000aAll this said, though, it\u2019s remarkable to think about a lot of people pounding this kind of food on a sweltering summer day in the Valley. But the pent-up demand for Fat Sal\u2019s in Encino has been building for years.\u000a\u000aFat Sal\u2019s establishments are open until at least 2 a.m. every day. When the mini restaurant chain debuted in Westwood in 2010, customers from the Valley drove over late at night. During rush hour, it can take an hour and a half to make this trip. But go at 10 p.m. or later and it might be 15 minutes to cruise down the 405 and make it to Westwood.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Valley people have been asking for a spot of their own since we opened in Westwood,\u201d Capek says.\u000a\u000aAfter Capek and his team spent two years scouring the Valley for real estate, and another 18 months finalizing all the permits and construction, Encino is home to its own location, and the first in California with a beer menu as well. (Fat Sal\u2019s in Austin also has a license.) Capek might add wine cocktails in the future.\u000a\u000aFat Sal\u2019s, of course, is perfect drunk food. In Westwood, the restaurant attracts UCLA students who come by before, during or after a night of partying. But as the crowd in family-friendly Encino proves, this type of food works well at 11 a.m., too. Capek is excited to have a restaurant where kids and their parents can come after soccer practice and Little League games. Mom and Dad can have a well-earned adult beverage with their grilled chicken sandwich or albacore wrap, while their hungry offspring dig into Philly cheesesteak fries.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of our restaurants are in areas where we attract single people late at night,\u201d say Capek, who also has outposts in Hollywood and San Diego in addition to the Westwood and Austin spots. \u201cIn Encino, we want to provide convenience for families.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt Fat Sal\u2019s, convenience comes in the form of pepperoni-pizza burgers, buffalo chicken cheese fries and thick milkshakes. Add a salad and you\u2019ve got a balanced meal.

aVFirst dates are a little weird for everybody, but the Superb Bird-of-Paradise may have the craziest first date in the animal kingdoms. This avian actually warps its whole body and dances so that it appears to be a giant, two-dimensional and slightly terrifying black and blue smiley face.\u000a\u000aIf the bird had only been recently discovered, it definitely would have been named the Emoji Bird, because when it transforms it looks like a bizarre emoji come to life.\u000a\u000aIn the video above from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, you can see a Superb spot a lady and gather up his feathers. He even has to use his beak to make it all work. By spreading out his jet black feathers in just the right way, all depth disappears from his body as light vanishes into them, as if he were a tiny, tiny black hole. Then, to keep the effect going, he hops right and left to make sure that the lady bird can\u2019t see him from any angle from straight on.\u000a\u000aEven better, scientists realized recently that a bird that they had thought was the same species is actually a second species. They could tell once they finally got recordings of the second bird\u2019s courtship dance. The birds only make these shapes when they are wooing ladies, so it can be tough to observe in the wild.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor centuries, people thought the Superb Bird-of-Paradise in the mountains of the Bird\u2019s Head region was a little different from the other populations throughout the rest of New Guinea, but no one had ever documented its display in the 200 plus years this bird has been known to occur there,\u201d Ed Scholes, a Cornell scientist, says in a post on the lab\u2019s website. Subsequent genetic studies confirmed the scientist\u2019s intuition.\u000a\u000aThe first bird scientists observed in New Guinea looks like a giant oval with a weird smile, while the newly discovered species from Indonesia looks much more stern\u2014at least, when he\u2019s getting his charm on. It doesn\u2019t always work.\u000a\u000aIn evolutionary terms, this is an example of sexual selection. When people talk about evolution, they usually focus on natural selection, the adaptations that allow creatures to survive and thrive. In truth, sexual selection\u2014traits that make a mate more attractive\u2014is also an extremely powerful force driving the shapes of species.\u000a\u000aStudents of evolutionary biology know that it\u2019s not at all unusual for species to exhibit sexual favor for traits that have no survival advantage\u2014for example, excessively large antlers on deer or widowbirds with such heavy feathers that it\u2019s hard to fly. Still, it beats being a male Anglerfish; males aren\u2019t even really distinct organisms in that especially depressing species.\u000a\u000aEvery bird-of-paradise has a unique shape it takes on during its mating ritual, which can be seen in video at the Birds-of-Paradise Project. They are all worth checking out, but the video above is the craziest.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s got to be a tough facade to keep up. Imagine how the man-bird feels when years later his bird-wife reminds him, \u201cHoney, I love you just the way you are, but I get super nostalgic whenever I think of that first time you warped your body into a giant two-dimensional smiley face.\u201d

aVIn Julian Schnabel: A Private Portrait, Schnabel is either talking or people close to him are talking about him. On a larger screen than his own large canvases, the artist paints, revisits his journey from Texas to New York, recalls the 1980s, dives off a high platform into the Mediterranean and paints some more.\u000a\u000aThe film is a cinematic portrait that features archival footage and is directed by Pappi Corsicato, a filmmaker whose work spans profiles of Richard Serra and investigations into the ruined city of Pompeii. Schnabel, who is credited as an executive producer, says there\u2019s no special reason why the film premiered last week at the Tribeca Film Festival and will open Friday at the Quad in Manhattan.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe the reason why it\u2019s coming out now is because it\u2019s finished now,\u201d said Schnabel, 65, sitting at a table with Corsicato in the skyscraper office of Cohen Media, a film distribution company founded by the real estate tycoon Charles Cohen, owner and renovator of the Quad.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody to make a movie about me. What was important was that the work was shown. It\u2019s not trying to show something that\u2019s spectacular, but at least you can get a sense of the scale of the work,\u201d said Schnabel, who wore a warm-up jacket with a reproduction of one of his paintings on the back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI sort of feel like I\u2019m a broken vase, and that he picked up the pieces and put the vase together as best he could,\u201d he said, speaking about Corsicato. That\u2019s high praise from a man who has broken his share of plates.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a biography,\u201d said Schnabel, who told me he never intended to make a self-portrait on film. \u201cBut my father said to me, when I made a film about Jean-Michel Basquiat, that I should have made it about myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked Schnabel what he said to his father after that suggestion.\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018It\u2019s O.K., Dad,\u2019 \u201d he remembered saying.\u000a\u000aSchnabel also noted that he originally hadn\u2019t intended to make the film about Basquiat either. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a movie director,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when Jean-Michel died, a Polish movie director came to interview me about Jean-Michel. His name was Lech Majewski, and he had a pretty encyclopedic knowledge of film. But he was a tourist, and I knew Jean-Michel so well and I knew what the world was. I think one of the problems with movie-making is that people don\u2019t know their topic.\u201d\u000a\u000aCorsicato, a Neapolitan who knew Schnabel before he spent two years making the documentary, set his sights high when it came to making a documentary about the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s my vision of Julian\u2019s life. It\u2019s my personal point of view. It\u2019s like a story that you see in a movie. It\u2019s like a classic movie. In the beginning I was inspired by Citizen Kane, Charles Foster Kane, the little kid who becomes grand\u2014but from an artistic point of view. It\u2019s really like an American dream,\u201d he said in heavily accented English.\u000a\u000aI asked whether Corsicato saw Schnabel as Orson Welles or Charles Foster Kane.\u000a\u000aSchnabel spoke up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe it\u2019s even more of a Fitzcarraldo kind of character, in the sense of what makes you do something that is ultimately illogical, like going to Sevilla and filling an abandoned monastery with paintings,\u201d Schnabel said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I do know is that history is a lie,\u201d Schnabel declared. \u201cEverybody has their version of history.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were there and they were there, and it\u2019s amazing how different their perception is of an event that occurred, but that\u2019s their truth,\u201d Schnabel said, looking at Corsicato. \u201cSomebody else would make a very different film. When he says that this is a private portrait, I would say that it\u2019s private to him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThroughout the film, family and friends recall Schnabel breaking rules and being true to his own creative spirit. Not a critical word is spoken, yet some recollections may come as a surprise. Jeff Koons, a contemporary, discusses how Schnabel helped him sell his first work of art.\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess it was nice that he said that. That\u2019s true, and I also got him his first exhibition,\u201d said Schnabel. \u201cWhen I first came to New York, nobody really helped me. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought it was good to help other people. It was pretty tough. Nobody really liked young artists in the \u201970s. I supported other artists, and I still do.\u201d\u000a\u000aTough times indeed. Shadowman, another documentary that revisits the 1980s art scene, made its world premiere at Tribeca and was runner-up for the festival\u2019s audience award. The subject is Richard Hambleton, whose graffiti daubs of threatening figures on the corners of buildings got him more attention than Keith Haring or Basquiat in the early 1980s. Hambleton, who attended his premiere in a wheelchair with a mask covering his cancer-ravaged face, struggled with drug addiction, then and now, and would disappear from public view for years at a time. In the film, Hambleton laments that, \u201cat least Basquiat died. I was alive when I died, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Hambleton story brought Schnabel back to the theme of success in the art market. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about apples and oranges. It depends on what you make,\u201d Schnabel noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many different lives,\u201d said Schnabel, who has made two films in his career about artists who died young: Basquiat and the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (Before Night Falls). \u201cLook, Vito Acconci died last night. Was Vito Acconci a successful artist? I would say he was. Was he a household name? Plenty of people who you talk to won\u2019t know who he was. But I can tell you how important he was,\u201d said Schnabel.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can look at an [Anselm] Kiefer painting which is very large, and people can understand why you might buy one of those and hang it in your house. But what about a Fat Chair by Joseph Beuys, which generated what Kiefer does?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same kind of marketability, because it\u2019s a peculiar object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeuys was a seminal influence for many artists\u2014Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Binky Palermo\u2014who were all his students. Yet when he died, his obituary might have said, \u2018the greatest artist on the north side of the street in Dusseldorf,\u2019 \u201d Schnabel added.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo many people around us have died\u2014Lou [Reed], David Bowie, and now Jonathan Demme. It\u2019s a death sentence being born. But what do you make out of it?\u201d the artist asked. \u201cSo if someone says that Keith [Haring], died and Jean-Michel died\u2014and it\u2019s certainly why his paintings got so expensive\u2014I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the answer to say, \u2018I\u2019d rather die before I get old,\u2019 like in the punk rock song.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked if he would be making another film of his own. The artist responded with the name of yet another artist who died young. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on something about Vincent van Gogh. I\u2019m working with Jean-Claude Carriere,\u201d he said. Carriere, the veteran screenwriter, is one of many friends interviewed in Corsicato\u2019s documentary.\u000a\u000aVan Gogh\u2019s myth is securely in place, but I mentioned to Schnabel that Before Night Falls, his portrait of a martyr to Castro and to AIDS, is responsible for making Reinaldo Arenas and his poetry known to a far greater public than if the film had never been made.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping to do,\u201d he said, looking across the table at Corsicato, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s what this film will do for me.\u201d

aVNEWARK \u2013 World leaders gathered on Tuesday in Johannesburg, South Africa to honor Nelson Mandela, a man who dedicated his life to fighting, and defeating, apartheid, a system of racial segregation embedded in his country\u2019s laws and enforced by its police. When remembering Mandela, New Jersey\u2019s leaders have mentioned a disturbing truth \u2013 the Garden State, in many ways, suffers de facto segregation that leaves its citizens separate but unequal.\u000a\u000aIt was Gov. Jim Florio who first coined the term \u201cthe two New Jerseys\u201d in his 1990 inaugural address, the same year Mandela was freed from prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor New Jersey to be truly a commonwealth, we simply cannot have two New Jerseys,\u201d Florio said. \u201cOne where youngsters go off on a road to college, and another where youngsters go off on a road to despair. One where towns flourish with the rewards of prosperity, and another with decaying cities, littered with abandoned cars and abandoned hopes.\u201d\u000a\u000aNearly 25 years later, the hope of closing this gap is a dream deferred.\u000a\u000aOne example of the continuing divide between rich and poor New Jersey was underscored by recent studies released jointly by Rutgers-Newark and UCLA in October. Stark numbers presented in the reports indicate that in the 2010-11 school year, almost half of black and Hispanic students attended schools where fewer than 10 percent of the students were white, and many attended schools where there were essentially no white students. The Rutgers report from the university\u2019s Institute on Education Law and Policy went so far as to call 191 of 1,597 schools statewide \u201capartheid schools,\u201d defined as schools where 1 percent or less of the student population is white and where at least 79 percent of students are low-income, a \u201cdouble segregation\u201d marked by race and poverty.\u000a\u000aThe Rev. Dr. M. William Howard, Jr., pastor of Newark\u2019s Bethany Baptist Church and the former chairman of Rutgers\u2019 Board of Governors, met Mandela personally as a result of his decades-long anti-apartheid activism.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew Jersey is arguably one of the most racially segregated states in the nation,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe question for me is not only race, but economics. Black people came to places like Newark, Paterson and Camden from the South to find work. That work has now disappeared, but those residents remained. The absence of capital, combined with a smidgen of racism, has produced the separation of families, decline in housing, increase in crime, and decline in the public schools in the cities. You will find black people living in some of the wealthiest suburbs in the state, provided they can afford the housing, and therefore have access to the suburban public schools.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we face today in our urban centers in our state is what Mandela still faced at the time of his death in South Africa,\u201d Howard added. \u201cIf we were to go together now to South Africa, we would find millions of black people living in the same squalid conditions that they knew before Mandela was released from prison. And we would find certain highly educated, economically advantaged black people now living in opulent, suburban areas. I\u2019m sure than Mandela recognized this, was not happy with this, and saw it as the long-term work of the South African government and society to correct this imbalance. New Jersey\u2019s cities are largely populated by people who are unlikely to be able to access the modern economy. You cannot explain the horrific situation of segregation in the state of New Jersey only in terms of race. To continue to chip away at public schools by the introduction of charter schools to the point that they are almost tipping the balance in places like Newark is a big mistake. Education is not only the key to reviving our central cities \u2013 it\u2019s the key to keeping our competitive edge in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoland Anglin, director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers, noted that the man seen as the father of South Africa would take a similar guiding hand to the Garden State\u2019s problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would first say that we need to look at the things that created segregation in New Jersey, just the way he looked at the things that created segregation in South Africa,\u201d Anglin said. \u201cI think he would say that the thing South Africa did with their struggle, that we perhaps need to do, is to have a clear and decisive forum for reconciliation and move forward on the things that are still problematic. In Newark, for example, we\u2019ve never come to a real reconciliation about the disturbances of the 1960s, and how society needed to do more to make sure that those who have been left behind have an adequate opportunity to progress so that balanced communities can be formed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have the suburbanization of people of color in New Jersey, but they are being re-concentrated in pockets,\u201d Anglin added. \u201cResidential patterns are not happening in a way that promotes upward mobility. Change involves some level of enforcing fair-housing laws that challenges landlords who won\u2019t rent to certain racial minorities coming out of urban areas. It also involves some level of incentives and social engineering. We don\u2019t have that appetite as a society, much less as a state. Nelson Mandela would say that we need to cement the public will on all sides to make change, not just people in urban areas \u2013 that\u2019s a doomed strategy. It is no one\u2019s interest to have a poor, under-fed class of people who don\u2019t have access to opportunity. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that they participate in the public life and economic life of this state and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor her part, Assemblywoman Grace Spencer (D-29) recalled protesting against apartheid during her college years. Many commentators have observed that there were two distinct periods in Nelson Mandela\u2019s career: a confrontational period where he advocated armed struggle against apartheid, the other a more conciliatory period after his release from prison that smoothed the way to majority rule in South Africa. Regarding what kind of public leadership is needed to end de facto segregation in New Jersey, Spencer suggested the adoption of a hybrid tone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe person who is rambunctious and defiant begins to call attention to de facto segregation in New Jersey,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cBut you also need the person who is more conciliatory who can bring people together and mend the wounds of the problem. I don\u2019t think apartheid would have ended if it wasn\u2019t for the rambunctious Mandela, and I don\u2019t think there would have been such a good transition without the conciliatory Mandela. You need both.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the man who encapsulated the concept of two New Jerseys, what must be done to end de facto desegregation in the state is clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cNelson Mandela would feel a need to speak out and point out the deficiencies that exist. We still do have two New Jerseys. Things have changed a bit, but only for the worse,\u201d Gov. Florio told PolitickerNJ.com. \u201cThe middle class is now feeling threatened by economic problems as well. It\u2019s going to take policy changes to make us a much more egalitarian society. Mr. Mandela would be out in the forefront trying to get those changes made.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need leadership that is willing to tell people things that they don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Florio added. \u201cAt this point, there are no good options. It\u2019s the difference between losing a finger and being decapitated. During the gubernatorial campaign we just went through, neither of the candidates, nor the press, talked about the overwhelming fiscal problems we\u2019re going to have in New Jersey in the coming years. That\u2019s because if you talk about it, someone is going to ask you what you\u2019re going to do about it. We all know poverty exists. But somebody\u2019s got to start talking about it. Somebody\u2019s got to be out front. Nelson Mandela is a good example of someone who was willing to take on things that were much more burdensome than things that we experienced. If he was willing to do that, then we have to have people who will at least raise issues for debate.\u201d

aVThere are plenty of Instagram-worthy opportunities in Williamsburg, from avocado toast at every single eatery to the pop art-inspired murals dotting Bedford Avenue. But one \u2018grammable moment that actually stands out amidst ice cream sandwiches at Smorgasburg is the brightly colored glass house directly under the Williamsburg Bridge, since it\u2019s not exactly easy to find for those who don\u2019t already know about it. The colorful greenhouse is at North Brooklyn Farms, an unexpected refuge on the waterfront surrounded by the rapidly climbing high-rises.\u000a\u000aOf course, a Williamsburg farm isn\u2019t exactly bucolic. Instead, the hipster space is home to a small skate park, and holds all sorts of events, with the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline as an ideal social media backdrop.\u000a\u000aOn the weekends, the farm offers a refuge from the typical boozy brunch routine, with a farm stand on Sundays and a small booth serving up cocktails and fresh food. There\u2019s even a weekend DJ if you want to pair lying out with lite EDM.\u000a\u000aBut the selling point of the secret farm, which is only open until early fall, and will potentially close to make way for more high-rises (just what Williamsburg needs!) this winter, is its availability for private events. This summer, the farm has played host to a Supper Women dinner party (their tagline is \u201cladies who launch and the (hu)men who love them), with a drone to capture the pre-dinner meditation moments\u2014and in true influencer fashion, it was sponsored by decidedly on-brand almond milk). This week, the farm peppered their usual yoga classes with a dose of doga, or dog yoga, hosted by Y7.\u000a\u000aIf you thought nothing was more Brooklyn than the world\u2019s first avocado restaurant, you were wrong. Because dog yoga, female founder dinner parties and the opportunity to Instagram a farm no one knows about, which is basically the equivalent of a rural speakeasy, means peak Williamsburg has finally been achieved.

aVDemocratic leadership has made several missteps in their efforts to woo voters that left en masse during the Obama administration. They have suppressed and undermined every opportunity for reform since Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss. In the DNC chair election, an establishment-backed candidate, Tom Perez, used backroom tactics to stop a Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter, Congressman Keith Ellison, from winning the position. Islamophobic smears were used to discredit Ellison, and later reports revealed that DNC members were threatened so that they would fall in line behind Perez. Similar tactics were used in Florida Democratic Party chair and California Democratic Party chair races.\u000a\u000aDespite a class action lawsuit pending in court against the DNC and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democratic leadership has continued to support Wasserman Schultz. Their support for her is now backfiring: She is at the center of a controversy surrounding her former IT staffer, Imran Awan, who she continued to employ up until his recent arrest for bank fraud. In regards to the class action lawsuit, DNC attorneys said in court that the organization has the right to rig primaries if they so choose. Regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s final outcome, the federal judge\u2019s decision and explanation will likely embarrass the party and expose its role in disenfranchising millions of voters to get Hillary Clinton elected.\u000a\u000aIn September 2017, the trial for Sen. Bob Menendez will begin over bribery charges he was indicted for in 2015. The Democratic Party will likely try to pretend that the trial doesn\u2019t exist, as it has with the DNC lawsuit and the investigation into Wasserman Schultz\u2019s IT staffer. In the fall, Hillary Clinton and former DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile are releasing their memoirs of the 2016 elections, which will likely broaden the rift between establishment Democrats and progressives. Democratic Party consultant Sally Albright recently tweeted about Clinton\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cSomeone on Hardball just said Hillary goes NUCLEAR on Bernie Sanders in her book.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat Russia interfered in the election has been one of the most perversive narratives pushed by Democratic leadership. Several Democrats, like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Congressman Adam Schiff and Congressman Ted Lieu, have built large followings by centering their messaging on Russia and Trump. But if the Trump-Russia investigation doesn\u2019t live up to the hype, voters may feel mislead, leading Democrats to suffer in 2018. On August 5, Politico reported that some Democrats are starting to fear repercussions from focusing too much on Russia. \u201cWe need to talk about what people think about when they wake up in the morning, and it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Democratic strategist Darry Sragow told Politico. \u201cThe more we talk about stuff that voters don\u2019t truly care about in their daily lives\u2026it confirms that the Democratic Party\u2019s brain has been eaten by the elites in Washington who have been sitting fat and happy for a lot of years while working Americans have lost their jobs and lost confidence in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome tactics that Democrats have used to elevate the Russia narrative, such as propping up conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch and constantly fetishizing about impeaching Trump, are frankly embarrassing. As the investigation progresses, each new development is treated as a smoking gun. In regards to the recent news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued a grand jury subpoena\u2014which is normally done in secret as it was during the Clinton email server investigation\u2014incited speculation that Mueller found evidence of criminal activity. The 2018 World Cup is being held in Russia just a few months before the midterm elections. Because of this, even more attention will be put on Russia, which will likely result in the most unhinged purveyors of the Russian election interference narrative taking center stage\u2014to the Democratic Party\u2019s detriment.\u000a\u000aOver the past few months, several Democrats have hinted that they will run for president in 2020, and Congressman John Delaney became the first to formally announce his bid for the presidency. Establishment Democrats are already working overtime to shut down criticism of their preferred candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Conflating policy criticism with disparaging progressives instead of engaging in tactical and beneficial discussions devolves critical thinking and hampers the party\u2019s ability to recover. The tactic of coercing voters to fall in line behind candidates that don\u2019t inspire excitement is embodied by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s new slogan, \u201cHave you seen the other guys?\u201d Democrats are doubling down on their tactic of focusing on how bad Trump is, even though it proved a dismal failure in 2016.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s rising disapproval rating hasn\u2019t led to a surge in popularity for the Democratic Party, and the perception that it will is dangerous. The Democrats\u2019 Better Deal agenda provided some refreshing ideas, but overall it fails to address the forces that enabled Trump\u2019s rise. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reduced the agenda to a \u201cpresentation\u201d rather than a change in the party\u2019s direction. The DCCC incited severe criticism among its base when its chair, Ben Ray Lujan, announced that abortion rights would not be a litmus test for Democratic candidates in upcoming elections. Many took this move as confirmation that Democrats are moving toward the center.\u000a\u000aOn August 3, The New York Times reported that West Virginia Governor Jim Justice switched parties from being a Democrat, a shift Sen. Joe Manchin has also signaled he might make as he begins to court Trump supporters. In order to recoup its losses, the Democratic party must enact drastic reforms. Instead, party leaders act as though their losses will naturally fix themselves with the help of a few minor adjustments. In doing so, they set themselves up for more embarrassment and failure.

aVAlan Rickman, who generated plenty of goose-pimples in his all-too-brief career, once confessed his scariest moment occurred when auditioning for Judge Turpin in the Sweeney Todd film: \u201cStephen Sondheim walked into the room and said, \u2018Sing.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s good to report that Jake Gyllenhaal, who just made his Broadway musical debut in Sondheim\u2019s Sunday in the Park with George, was spared this special terror even hardcore career singers know to dread. For that, he can thank Jeanine Tesori.\u000a\u000aThe Tony-winning composer of Fun Home, in her capacity as Artistic Director of Encores! Off-Center (New York City Center\u2019s series of four-day Off-Broadway revivals), hired him twice for his heretofore unknown musical gifts: first, suddenly, as Seymour in Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman\u2019s Little Shop of Horrors and then as Georges Seurat, painting his famed \u201cSunday on La Grande Jatte\u201d in Sunday et cetera.\u000a\u000a\u201cJeanine and I went through the music, and I felt she was\u2014without letting me know\u2014testing me in the process,\u201d recalled Gyllenhaal. \u201cMaybe they were a bit sneaky. They made it seem like I didn\u2019t have to, but I must have been auditioning.\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal\u2019s suspicions are correct: \u201cSteve just said, \u2018Can he sing it?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes. Absolutely!\u2019 And that was it,\u201d Tesori relayed. Not so fortunate was Gyllenhaal\u2019s leading lady, Annaleigh Ashford, who plays Seurat\u2019s mistress and muse, Dot.\u000a\u000aShe\u2019s the proven musical-comedy talent (with a Tony nomination for Kinky Boots and a Tony win for You Can\u2019t Take It With You), but she had to sing for Sondheim.\u000a\u000aWhen the offer came, she was eight months pregnant (which, actually, would have worked for Dot) and in L.A. \u201cI had to make a recording for him so that he knew that I could sing the low notes in the opening number because it\u2019s quite low for a lady voice,\u201d remembered Ashford. \u201cThat was a magical moment for me. I was in my underwear, recording it on my computer on GarageBand, and I gave him extra scales to show him how high I went up. Then, I sent that little mp3 off, and here we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aTesori suspected a musical career might be lurking in Gyllenhaal when she heard he did musicals in high school. That, plus the fact that they shared the same agent, cinched the deal. \u201cWhen I was putting Little Shop together, I asked our agent if Jake would do it. He said, \u2018He might. Let me ask him.\u2019\u201d The actor was interested enough to have lunch with Tesori and discuss the possibilities. \u201cHe was doing Constellations at the time, and I started pestering him. But it wasn\u2019t until I went backstage and left him a plant that had little legs and hands on it\u2013with ketchup\u2014that he said \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal and Ashford, basking in the extra rehearsal, turn in assured, risk-taking portrayals. \u201cAs intimidating as his music is, it\u2019s also incredibly enveloping,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as you feel it in the audience, you feel it doing it as a performer. You feel safe.\u201d\u000a\u000aLa La Land musicals being all the rage now, the two leads were asked what film musicals they\u2019d like to do. Ashford paused a thoughtful beat and declared \u201cThis!\u201d\u000a\u000aThen, on further reflection, she amended that from Sunday to any given Sondheim: \u201cHis body of work is so special it\u2019s almost indelible in the lexicon of art. We should try to explore his pieces on film. It\u2019s important his work be celebrated on screen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat particular question has never come up before for Gyllenhaal, being so new to musicals. \u201cI\u2019m asked that a lot about roles in general,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe way this thing came together was serendipitous in an unlikely combination of elements\u2014almost like fate impeding and pushing in the way that it needed to be expressed. That\u2019s generally how I look at [roles] at this point. I\u2019ve never been someone who said, \u2018I want to do that,\u2019 though at some point I guess Tevye might be a good idea.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, how close does Seurat come to other characters that Gyllenhaal has played? \u201cThere\u2019s an obsessive quality to him, a focused quality that connects to a lot of characters I relate to and have played. One way or another, they\u2019ve all been leading to George, so I\u2018d probably say, really, all of them\u2014even The Day After Tomorrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aSondheim and his director-book writer, James Lapine, drew a soaring celebration of the creative spirit from the two years Seurat spent turning chaos into coherence and disharmony into harmony for his masterpiece. As such, it seems the perfect vehicle to return the Hudson Theater to theatrical life after a half-century of other venues.\u000a\u000aGingerly tending the transfer of a book-in-hand City Center concert to a full-on, affecting Broadway production is Lapine\u2019s niece, Sama\u2013and that\u2019s not the naked nepotism it might seem. In fact, she said, \u201cIt was very cool the way it came about at City Center, really a kind of collaborative discovery between James and Jeanine.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen it became clear that the original director would not be free to repeat the chore\u2014he was busy reviving Falsettos on Broadway the same week Sunday was slated for City Center\u2014Tesori suggested getting a young up-and-coming director to do it, perhaps even a female one, and started feeding Lapine resumes to that effect.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, suddenly, he said, \u2018Oh, wait a minute, I know a fabulous young woman director, and she has already done the show!\u2019 So he called me, and we got together.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer previous Sunday had been a regional production in Columbus, Ohio. She also did a Sondheim concert with the Boston Pops in which she got to stage the painting with only six actors. \u201cIt taught me a lot about the minimalist take on such productions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d appears to be thrilled with not only the show\u2019s return but his niece\u2019s handiwork as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it without his love and support, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aRashly, before the generally rhapsodic reviews came out, the producers voluntarily withdrew the show from Tony Awards consideration so they wouldn\u2019t have to dole out 1,600 comps to voters\u2014a perilous proposition for such a short (ten-week) run.\u000a\u000aThat leaves Gyllenhaal and Ashford clinging to the \u201cIt\u2019s the work, not the reward\u201d maxim for dear life, but both can make it through without that shiny piece of silver.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a line in the show: \u2018the art of making art,\u2019\u201d Ashford pointed out. \u201cWhen I walk in the door every day, I think, \u2018We really are here for \u2018the art of making art.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aGyllenhaal, likewise, high-roaded it: \u201cI think the performers on Broadway who have long runs work so hard for a long period of time after all the fanfare and all the excitement has passed. That\u2019s a big part of the win, in my opinion, or the nomination of a Tony. We\u2019re doing a lot of hard work right now, but our run is only ten weeks, and that is just a fact. We all know, too, that, as much as it\u2019s an honor and a history, it\u2019s also a business, and I think that business and these awards are also about getting attention and making sure that people see . . . these extraordinary shows that are on Broadway now. The most important thing for us is to get people here to see the show . . . and to make sure people keep coming back to Broadway, so there\u2019s no reason to usurp any of that. We should all be a community supporting each other.\u201d

aV\u201cI know I\u2019m a very serious person. I\u2019m under a lot of pressure most days and so I work really hard not to crack. I am trying to keep it all together without breaking,\u201d says my client.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know,\u201d I respond. \u201cI can tell that you\u2019re exceptionally uptight. So let me ask you a random question\u2014in the midst of a hurricane, is it better to be a blade of grass or a tree?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat?\u201d he retorts. \u201cI guess a tree. It\u2019s solid\u2014it\u2019s strong enough to weather any storm.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot necessarily\u2026\u201d I reply.\u000a\u000aWhen you\u2019re rigid in life, life will snap you in half.\u000a\u000aConsider a very tall oak tree in the middle of hurricane. The tree is so rigid, it doesn\u2019t give way during the storm so when the winds blow, it\u2019s the first thing that gets snapped in half. Or worse, ripped up by its roots and tossed into another zip code.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, the tall blade of sea grass will yield to the wind. Yes, it will be blown over time and time again, but because it bends to the storm, it allows those violent winds to pass by\u2014never getting uprooted or torn apart. Once the storm departs, it stands up like everything is fine.\u000a\u000aThe more you relax into your life, the better your life will be.\u000a\u000aThe tree resists the weather and consequently gets violently tossed about, whereas the blade of grass has learned flexibility\u2014it detaches from the chaos and gives in to the winds of change. No one likes to be blown over, but if you can relax into the storm and be easy about it, you\u2019ll remain rooted. Eventually the sun will come out and you\u2019ll be the one left standing.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn reality all that is happening is that life is mirroring back to you your own struggle for control. So, when you learn to relax and let go of things that you cannot control, you\u2019ll find that life eases up on you. All the tension and stress you\u2019ve been experiencing is self-induced and it\u2019s solely a bi-product of your mind.\u201d I tell him.\u000a\u000aIf you think you are the one who needs to keep everything together, the universe will make sure everything around you perpetually falls apart.\u000a\u000aIf you feel the need to be in full control, the universe will validate that and deliver to you every reason to feel that way. Your need to control will attract situations that are seemingly out of control, in order to grant you the experience you are unconsciously requesting.\u000a\u000aWhen you are uptight, you restrict the natural flow of creative energy around you.\u000a\u000aLife becomes boring and habitual when you are constantly struggling to keep order. You\u2019ll become physically and emotionally drained, and weary. That glow and enthusiasm for life will easily become lost. The universe responds by mirroring back your imagined struggle and self-fulfilling confinement.\u000a\u000aLife gets hard when you are working hard to control your life.\u000a\u000aChildren have the right idea. They don\u2019t try to control, they allow themselves to be playful with life, and, because they approach situations with a levity and lightness and natural curiosity, the universe responds by bringing them joyous and dynamic situations.\u000a\u000aLife is meant to be enjoyed not evaluated. The only evaluation should be \u201chas it brought me joy today?\u201d\u000a\u000aJoy is suffocated under the command of routine and structure. When you let go of the need to control, you open up to the possibility of experiencing more joy. Let go, let loose, and learn to go with the flow of your life. Once you do, the universe will bring you every reason to be joyful.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t worry about making a mess. Better to have lived on that sofa than to have sat on the plastic for decades.\u000a\u000aControl might keep the mess away, but your life is meant to be lived, not observed from afar. The beauty and joy are in the living and sometimes that living gets messy. That\u2019s the best part. Live it\u2014have fun with it\u2014get in there and get your hands dirty. Make a mess of it. At least you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve lived it.\u000a\u000aHere are three tips for making the best mess of your life.\u000a\u000aTake the stick out of your butt. In other words, don\u2019t take yourself so seriously\u2014learn to laugh at yourself, learn to be easy with yourself, learn to be light. When you approach life with ease, your life naturally becomes easier. Being uptight guarantees you\u2019ll crack. Much more comfortable to walk through life without the stick. Don\u2019t be afraid to color outside the lines. Don\u2019t fear making that mess. It\u2019s only within the mess that the magic happens. It is within that space you\u2019ll find you\u2019re not afraid to make mistakes, and you\u2019re not afraid of breaking the rules\u2014that you can create the life of your dreams. Once you have made the best mess possible, you can pull together the best parts of yourself because now you know what they are. Honor the mess, don\u2019t clean it up. When chaos happens and things don\u2019t go your way, don\u2019t try and mitigate the damage, celebrate it. Recognize that things don\u2019t always go your way because sometimes they\u2019re destined to go even better.\u000a\u000aBased in New York City, Donnalynn is the Author of \u201cLife Lessons, Everything You Ever Wished You Had Learned in Kindergarten.\u201d She is also a Certified Intuitive Life Coach, Inspirational Blogger (etherealwellness.wordpress.com), writer and speaker.

aVJohn Carney found out the hard way that the internet is just like the Hunger Games.\u000a\u000aThe Breitbart finance and economics editor was incredibly disturbed by the cover of Vogue\u2018s September issue, which features actress Jennifer Lawrence posing on a boat in front of the Statue of Liberty.\u000a\u000aWe're going to have to create a full #MAGA shadow cultural industry because the Opposition Media can't even do fashion without attacking us pic.twitter.com/NRPf2JUfsy \u2014 John Carney (@carney) August 10, 2017\u000a\u000aWhat exactly is so offensive about a monument to a free, welcoming America? It all goes back to Stephen Miller.\u000a\u000aDuring a press briefing last week, the White House senior policy adviser had a contentious exchange with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta about the Statue of Liberty. Acosta quoted from \u201cThe New Colossus,\u201d the Emma Lazarus sonnet inscribed on the side of the statue, while asking a question about immigration. In his response, Miller stated the poem was \u201cadded later\u201d and \u201cnot actually part of the original Statue of Liberty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is technically true\u2014as its name suggests, the statue is a monument to liberty and not immigration. And \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d was engraved on the statue in 1903 (16 years after the statue was erected). Because Lazarus was an abolitionist, however the poem did give the statue extra significance\u2014which hasn\u2019t been controversial until now.\u000a\u000aBut because of Miller\u2019s remarks, Republicans have been on the offensive about the Statue of Liberty for the last week. Hence Carney\u2019s response, which he expanded upon in later tweets.\u000a\u000aIndeed, Vogue communications director Zara Rahim revealed that photographer Annie Lebowitz shot Lawrence\u2019s Vogue cover in June, well before the Miller-Acosta controversy.\u000a\u000aEven more ironically, one of Breitbart\u2019s logos actually includes the Statue of Liberty.\u000a\u000aUh\u2026https://t.co/dhXerDk0Pm pic.twitter.com/EPLTRXC5q4 \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) August 10, 2017\u000a\u000aThis whole situation gave the internet a much-needed laugh.\u000a\u000atfw you see the statute of liberty and need a safe space. pic.twitter.com/3mJggGeRj9 \u2014 sean.

aVComedy Central\u2019s Broad City is an absolutely fantastic show. It\u2019s really funny but it\u2019s also completely unafraid to tackle any and all topics no matter how cringe-inducing or taboo they may be. One of the most frequented topics from creators and stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson is sex and, to a slightly lesser degree, sex toys. Since we live in a capitalist world, someone had the brilliant idea to leverage Broad City\u2018s fascination with sex and sex toys into a lucrative money-making opportunity.

aVA black women comedy show hosted a \u201cnight of levity for black lives\u201d to inspire \u201ccommunity\u201d among black people, coinciding with the third anniversary of the death of 18-year-old black teen Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.\u000a\u000aThe show, dubbed \u201cA Night of Levity For Black Lives,\u201d was hosted by monthly production \u201cSisters of Comedy,\u201d a show founded by writer, activist and filmmaker Agunda Okeyo in 2014 to showcase black female comedians and celebrate black women. Black Lives Matter: NYC, which served as a co-sponsor for the show in July 2016, also co-sponsored this year. The event was held at stand-up comedy nightclub Carolines on Broadway in Times Square.\u000a\u000aOkeyo, a Bronx native who is of Kenyan origin, said that last year\u2019s show coincided with the death of Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black man in Minnesota, and Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, in Baton Rouge, La. at the hands of police officers as well as the shooting of five police officers in Dallas. This year\u2019s show falls on the anniversary of Brown\u2019s death, which sparked protests in Ferguson and other parts of the United States, she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe did a show last year in July and it was actually a really intense and important showcase because it was the week that Philando Castile was killed, Alton was killed and it was also the night of the Dallas shooting,\u201d Okeyo told the more than 300 people in attendance. \u201cAnd tonight, in some sort of serendipitous way, we\u2019re coming together again to bring some levity to black lives because tonight is also the day that Mike Brown was killed \u2014 three years ago today.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said partial proceeds from yesterday\u2019s show will go toward Black August, a month that commemorates and supports the work of political prisoners. She highlighted the late Kenyan environmental political activist Wangari Maathai, the first African woman to win the Pulitzer Peace Prize; the late anti-apartheid activist and former South African President Nelson Mandela; and American political activist Angela Davis, as examples of political prisoners.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are really powerful, important people we can think about in our lives, right, and they sacrificed their freedom for what we believe,\u201d Okeyo continued. \u201cSo tonight, we\u2019re definitely saying black lives matter. We\u2019re definitely saying we\u2019re here to have a great night and laugh and have some levity and be able to let it out and make sure people eat and drink and are a community.\u201d\u000a\u000aA grand jury announced that it would not indict the police officer who killed Brown, and the U.S. Department of Justice decided against civil rights charges \u2014 though it called for reforms to the Ferguson Police Department.\u000a\u000aA group of prominent black female comedians and actresses graced the stage, including Nigerian American actress Yvonne Orji, who stars as \u201cMolly\u201d on HBO\u2019s comedy drama series \u201cInsecure\u201d; Michelle Buteau of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Half Hour\u201d; Kerry Coddett of MTV\u2019s \u201cJoking Off\u201d; Mugga, star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d; Janelle James of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cMidnight\u201d; and Comedy Central\u2019s Yamaneika Saunders of \u201cThe Meredith Vieira Show.\u201d\u000a\u000aChloé Hilliard, a comedian and journalist who has been featured on NBC\u2019s \u201cLast Comic Standing,\u201d was the show\u2019s emcee.\u000a\u000aThe comedians\u2019 jokes centered on black women\u2019s experiences \u2014 both joys and challenges \u2014 that hit close to home for the crowd, which was made up primarily of black women but also included black men as well as men and women of other races.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe show is a cacophony of black female excellence,\u201d Hilliard said, garnering roaring laughter from the crowd. \u201cI went to college! I\u2019m still paying that loan but I know what cacophony means!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe blasted an individual who questioned why the show only featured black women.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis one guy \u2014 I\u2019ll let you guess his race \u2014 tweets back at me, \u2018You\u2019re always talking about diversity but why is everybody black?\u2019 to which I responded, \u2018Where \u2026 do you see diversity on this flyer? It says \u2018Sisters of Comedy\u2019 and you already technically have different shades of us, so boom! There\u2019s your diversity,'\u201d Hilliard added, again drawing raucous laughter from attendees.\u000a\u000aOkeyo told the Observer before the show that last year, partial proceeds for the show supported Jasmine Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter leader in Pasadena, Calif., who was arrested and charged with \u201cfelony lynching,\u201d which is defined as trying to \u201cunlawfully remove a suspect from police custody.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said that working with Black Lives Matter: NYC comes down to her role as an activist \u2014 she and other activists and organizers started a \u201cHater Free NYC\u201d campaign that targets any businesses associated with the administration of President Donald Trump over policies that have impacted marginalized groups.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat people will walk away with tonight is, \u2018Yes, we have all these other things that are kind of coming together behind what this night is about but this night is about levity,'\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about laughter. It\u2019s about black women. It\u2019s about talented artists. It\u2019s about people being able to see beyond obstacles.\u201d

aVIn my last column, I explained how the Trump administration is trying to distract the public from increasingly serious investigations of the president\u2019s ties with Moscow by disseminating lies\u2014particularly about Seth Rich, the murdered Democratic National Committee staffer. According to the White House, with help from its media allies such as Fox News, Rich\u2014not Russian spies\u2014was the \u201creal\u201d source of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails that were leaked last summer.\u000a\u000aThat none of this is true hasn\u2019t stopped this narrative from gaining traction among Trump supporters. The president himself allegedly had a hand in crafting the noxious lies about Seth Rich, which were broadcast by Sean Hannity, a friend of Trump\u2019s, on Fox News back in May\u2014only to be quickly recanted by the network for their transparent falsehood.\u000a\u000aHowever, close examination of the Seth Rich Active Measure (to use the proper espionage term) reveals Russia\u2019s deep involvement in this White House-backed fabrication. This sordid saga commenced on July 16, 2016, less than a week after Seth Rich was murdered by an unknown gunman late at night on the streets of our nation\u2019s capital.\u000a\u000aJust six days after the killing of the 27-year-old DNC staffer, a remarkable story appeared on a shadowy conspiracy website called Sorcha Faal, which regularly posts flagrant lies from a Russian viewpoint. Among its other 2016 \u201cscoops,\u201d Sorcha Faal spread the story that two U.S. Marine helicopters had been shot down by Turkey, killing 12 Americans\u2014which never happened but got picked up by Russia\u2019s mainstream media.\u000a\u000aIts coverage of Rich\u2019s murder was even more inventive. According to Sorcha Faal, the young man had been assassinated by a Clintonian \u201chit team,\u201d which was captured a few days later \u201cafter a running gun battle with U.S. federal police forces just blocks from the White House.\u201d In this sensational story, Rich was lured to his death by Hillary\u2019s assassins, who posed as FBI agents to gain the DNC employee\u2019s trust. As the source of the stolen emails, Rich had to be liquidated to protect the Democratic presidential nominee and her family, which, Sorcha Faal reported, has been behind numerous murders.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, there\u2019s no evidence for any of the assertions made in this report, yet Sorcha Faal claimed its source was none other than Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service or SVR! The website asserted it had seen the \u201csomber\u201d SVR secret report on the Rich murder and its shocking backstory, including that \u201cSVR \u2018electronic specialists\u2019 performing counterintelligence \u2018missions/operations\u2019 noted on 7 July an \u2018enormous/gigantic\u2019 increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the DNC headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation offices in New York City.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is classic Kremlin disinformation, taking a bit of fact and adding a great deal of fiction to smear Moscow\u2019s opponents, yet it bears noting that all the major claims made by Team Trump in the year since Seth Rich\u2019s murder were there, in the \u201cSVR report,\u201d just days after the killing.\u000a\u000aHere we have Seth Rich rather than Russian spies as the \u201creal\u201d source of Hillary\u2019s emails. There\u2019s a DNC cover-up of the true, awful story. There\u2019s Clintonian corruption and multiple assassinations. There\u2019s even a dirty, complicit FBI Director James Comey protecting Hillary and her \u201chit team.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt didn\u2019t take long for Kremlin mouthpieces to jump on the bandwagon. By early August 2016, Wikileaks, led by Julian Assange, was implying that Rich was the source of the stolen DNC emails that the \u201cprivacy advocates\u201d dumped online less than two weeks after his murder. On August 9, Wikileaks announced on Twitter a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich\u2019s killer.\u000a\u000aOn the very same day, Trump\u2019s dirty-trickster pal Roger Stone tweeted that Seth Rich was the \u201c4th mysterious death connected to the DNC in less than a month\u201d and suggested Hillary was behind the killings. Perhaps not coincidentally, Stone has admitted he possesses a \u201cback-channel\u201d to Assange, who\u2019s been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy for more than five years.\u000a\u000aOnce Assange and Stone co-tweeted about Seth Rich, pro-Trump social media went wild with the unsubstantiated accusations, making it a standard far-right trope. It eventually culminated in the quickly discredited mid-May 2017 Sean Hannity \u201cbombshell\u201d on Fox News, which the White House allegedly had a direct hand in.\u000a\u000aTo complete the disinformation circle and bring this Kremlin lie back to where it started, on May 19, 2017, the Russian embassy in London approvingly cited Hannity and Fox News with a provocative tweet stating, \u201cWikileaks informer Seth Rich murdered in US but GB MSM was so busy accusing Russian hackers to take notice.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is but one example of how the Kremlin and Team Trump collude to spread lies to the public\u2014albeit a deeply troubling one, given its maligning of a murdered young American who cannot speak in his own defense. Such operations are ongoing and have become a staple of daily Trump administration operations.\u000a\u000aTake the current online smear campaign against Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, the National Security Adviser, who\u2019s hated by the far-right for his recent purging of pro-Moscow extremists from the NSC staff. This has raised the ire of pro-Trump social media, leading to vile, concocted accusations of McMaster being controlled by Jewish financiers while being anti-Israel at the same time. As if that smear were not enough, pro-Trump \u201cinvestigators\u201d known to have tight links to the White House have spread ugly rumors about McMaster\u2019s personal life.\u000a\u000aMoscow\u2019s hand is easily detectable behind this vicious online campaign. A new analysis conclusively demonstrates the key role of Kremlin propagandists behind the #FireMcMaster Twitter hashtag effort to coax the president into cashiering his national security adviser. Here the usual alt-right suspects got the ball rolling: InfoWars and Breitbart, backed by pro-Kremlin online trolls. Bots\u2014that is, automated Twitter accounts guided by software, not a human\u2014have been crucial to the #FireMcMaster campaign as well, and their role in online Kremlin propaganda is growing rapidly.\u000a\u000aTrump himself just showed his hand by retweeting and praising \u201cNicole Mincey,\u201d a young African-American superfan who turns out to not actually exist and may actually be a Russian bot. Given the extent of Russian online assistance to Team Trump in its ceaseless media war against fellow Americans, citizens should have questions about what\u2019s really going on here and who\u2019s pulling the strings.\u000a\u000aThe White House, too, should be concerned. Now that the Kremlin is openly signaling its disapproval of Trump in the wake of his embarrassing failure to stop increased congressional sanctions on Russia, Vladimir Putin\u2019s powerful propaganda apparatus seems to be turning on its once-promising protégé\u2014precisely as I told you it would. Analysts are noting that Russian Twitter bots are starting to target prominent Republicans, not just opponents of President Trump. It seems only a matter of time until Russian intelligence takes aim at the White House too.\u000a\u000aJohn Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer. A specialist in espionage and terrorism, he\u2019s also been a Navy officer and a War College professor. He\u2019s published four books and is on Twitter at @20committee.

aVTwo Asian lawmakers representing large Korean communities in Queens are calling on President Trump to put an end to the \u201cad libbing\u201d on Twitter and focus on diplomatic channels and peaceful measures to resolve the ongoing conflict with the North Korean government.\u000a\u000aTrump warned North Korea on Tuesday that if it makes any more threats against the United States, such an action \u201cwill be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d saying that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201chas been very threatening.\u201d North Korea outlined its threats more specifically, with state media indicating later Tuesday that it is \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a proposal to strike Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory, with missiles.\u000a\u000aToday, Trump suggested that his assertion \u201cwasn\u2019t tough enough\u201d and said \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d when asked what would constitute a tough response.\u000a\u000aQueens Congresswoman and Democratic National Committee Vice Chairwoman Grace Meng, who is Taiwanese, said that her constituents are \u201chorrified\u201d by Trump\u2019s behavior.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell locally, our constituents are horrified,\u201d Meng told Observer following the press conference at Flushing Town Hall in downtown Flushing this afternoon. \u201cThis not a topic nor a time for the president of the United States to be ad libbing. This is a time when he should consult his military experts and not just say things on Twitter or off the cuff. He arguably drew a red line and was almost daring North Korea to cross it and that\u2019s just not responsible rhetoric or actions.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said that \u201cdefinitely\u201d wants to see a diplomatic solution and urged him to \u201cconsult and listen to his military experts.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd she said that the lawmakers on the appropriate committees \u201care talking in a bipartisan way\u201d about next steps.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the White House, his experts are trying to do their part in making sure he\u2019s not just tweeting or saying things off the cuff. If there is any sort of declaration of war, that is something that should be left for Congress to discuss,\u201d Meng continued.\u000a\u000aLast weekend, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to issue new set of sanctions against North Korea that the State Department said could cost North Korea $1 billion after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.\u000a\u000aDuring the press conference, Meng told reporters that the sanctions are \u201ca good step,\u201d insisting that it is a \u201ctremendous and necessary step.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe House previously passed legislation in May on an almost unanimous vote and this past week, President Trump signed the legislation that passed and it was again passed in a strong bipartisan showing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s necessary. I think that whatever we need to do \u2026 to curb North Korea\u2019s ability to increase and strengthen their weapons development is crucial.\u201d\u000a\u000aQueens Assemblyman Ron Kim, a native of South Korea who called on Trump to work on developing a \u201cunited front\u201d with allied nations last month, said he is ready to support Meng.\u000a\u000a\u201cCongresswoman Grace Meng has been very vocal about this and any other foreign policy issue on our behalf and it\u2019s such a tough fight for her to be down there with a president like Donald Trump and a Congress and a Senate that\u2019s dominated by another party,\u201d Kim told Observer. \u201cAnd I just wanna make sure that she understands that we have her back, that we appreciate her sticking up for us because there are thousands of concerned Korean Americans, Asian Americans and the community at large that do not wanna see war in the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aKim \u2014 the first and only South Korean elected to the state Senate, whose district includes Flushing, Whitestone, Mitchell-Linden and Murray Hill \u2014 noted that Korean War veterans from the United States \u201chave horrible night stories\u201d about the war that he said is \u201cforgotten in this country.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a whole collection of people that want to see Korea and want to see President Trump de-escalate and make sure that we foster the right environment where we can reunite the two countries,\u201d Kim continued.\u000a\u000aThe assemblyman visited North Korea nearly 10 years ago with a delegation of 40 other Americans from the private and public sectors on a peacekeeping and education trip for one day, where he witnessed that people are under-nourished. He said he has family in Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital, including his grandmother and his cousin who is seven months pregnant.\u000a\u000aKim told reporters that Trump\u2019s penchant for tweeting is alarming.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a president that\u2019s so impulsive and does his foreign policy on Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very scary thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aKorean community leaders also spoke out against Trump\u2019s approach, including Minsun Kim, president of the Korean American Association of Greater New York; Chongho Kim, head pastor of Flushing United Methodist Church; and Jineun Park, reverend of Won Buddhist Temple.

aVConference Presentations Aren\u2019t Publications\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s an important point here that not a single journalist picked up on. These were conference presentations. What that means is that they weren\u2019t peer-reviewed research, they weren\u2019t published papers, they were just people presenting the findings of ongoing work.\u000a\u000aConference presentations are evidence in the same way that a buttered piece of bread is a beef sandwich. It\u2019s half-done, preliminary, and often missing the meat. The studies might turn out to be incredibly important, but there\u2019s always the chance that, when all the data is collected, the results will be negative anyway. It\u2019s also important to remember that there are serious issues with pre-publication research, which is often much more biased than research that has been through peer-review. This is for a number of reasons, but primarily because you don\u2019t get much information about these pre-published studies. Rather than a 3,000 word article, you get a 200-word abstract, which tells you very little about what the researchers did, and what they might have gotten wrong.\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s not all.\u000a\u000aThese studies, all eight of them, were tiny. Seriously tiny. The biggest one had about 80 participants. Many didn\u2019t even have a control group. Regardless of how interesting your results are, if you only tested 23 people and didn\u2019t have a control group, you\u2019ve basically wasted your time because you literally can\u2019t prove anything with that few people. So what happens when you look at large studies of yoga?\u000a\u000aYoga Is Exercise\u000a\u000aThe media has represented these studies as groundbreaking research, but it turns out that they aren\u2019t, really. People have been looking at yoga as an intervention for conditions from lower back pain to depression for years. It turns out that, when you do a massive study with hundreds or even thousands of participants, yoga does\u2026not so well. In fact, it is basically indistinguishable from any other form of light exercise. To put it another way, there\u2019s no health difference between yoga and going for a walk in the park.\u000a\u000aThis is not at all surprising. Yoga is basically just another form of light exercise. There\u2019s no physiological reason to expect that yoga has any actual benefit.

aVPresident Trump on Thursday said he will declare a public health emergency to combat the opioid addiction crisis, adopting the chief recommendation from a special commission led by Gov. Chris Christie.\u000a\u000aTrump told pool reporters at his Bedminster golf club that his administration is drawing up documents to make the national emergency declaration. The president called the opioid death epidemic in the United States a \u201cserious problem\u201d and pledged to spend time, effort and money on the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m saying officially right now it is an emergency,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a national emergency and we are drawing up documents now to so attest.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s announcement came two days after his top health official threw cold water on Christie\u2019s idea of declaring a national emergency. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Tuesday that the federal government already had the power and resources needed to address the issue without an emergency declaration.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe that at this point that the resources that we need or the focus that we need to bring to bear to the opioid crisis at this point can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency, although all things are on the table for the president,\u201d Price said then.\u000a\u000aTrump made no mention of Christie\u2019s report on Tuesday during a briefing on the opioid crisis, instead focusing on deterrence and federal drug crime prosecutions \u2014 something not mentioned in the Christie report \u2014 and teaching young people that drugs are \u201cno good; really bad for you.\u201d But by Thursday, Trump seemed to have warmed to Christie\u2019s idea to declare a national emergency.\u000a\u000aDeclaring a national emergency was the top recommendation of the president\u2019s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, which is chaired by Christie and released an interim, 10-page report July 31. The commission told Trump an emergency declaration would free up resources, empower the administration and pressure Congress to provide more funding to address the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would also awaken every American to this simple fact: if this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will,\u201d the report said.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the commission said a national emergency would allow the administration to remove restrictions on where Medicaid patients can receive treatment and to negotiate lower prices on naloxone \u2014 a life-saving overdose antidote \u2014 for government units. It also recommended developing non-opioid pain relievers, mandating medical education in opioid prescribing and stemming the flow of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, into the country.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Christie thanked the president for accepting the commission\u2019s national emergency recommendation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a national emergency and the president has confirmed that through his words and actions today, and he deserves great credit for doing so,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAs I have said before, I am completely confident that the president will address this problem aggressively and do all he can to alleviate the suffering and loss of scores of families in every corner of our country. We look forward to continuing the commission\u2019s efforts and to working with this president to address the approximately 142 deaths a day from drug overdoses in the United States.\u201d

aVAlison Wright makes one hell of a first impression. \u201cI\u2019m dying right now,\u201d the actress says mere moments after we meet, laughing and draping a blanket over her shoulders nearly as thick as her Sunderland accent. The situation is understandable, though. We sit down to talk in the back of a Brooklyn photography studio less than 24 hours after Wright made her Broadway debut in Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat, not to mention on the same Sunday the actress returns to TV in Feud: Bette and Joan, from reigning king of the anthology series, Ryan Murphy. It\u2019s an impressive, back-to-back series of accomplishments\u2014especially from someone introduced to American audiences just four years ago on The Americans\u2014that demands a celebration late into the night, early morning interview be damned.\u000a\u000aWell, early afternoon interview.\u000a\u000aTruthfully, though, if this is talking to Wright while she\u2019s dying, I\u2019d love to meet her living. The Lee Strasberg Institute graduate smiles easy and often; she answers questions with a stage performer\u2019s poise mingled with a charisma made for cameras. She\u2019s whip quick, too. At one point, to demonstrate her preparation for the 1961-set Feud, Wright seamlessly adopts an old-school American accent. \u201cWell, good morning, Ms. Crawford,\u201d she says, in a voice you might have heard echoing from Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre in an era when most of the handprints out front were still drying. Wright calls it \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood sound,\u201d and you recognize it immediately even without being able to describe how.\u000a\u000aIt is exactly \u201cthat old-fashioned Hollywood\u201d\u2014for better, but often for worse\u2014which Feud concerns itself with. The eight-episode anthology series chronicles the behind-the-scenes conflict of 1962 thriller Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, which starred veritable screen legends and perennial rivals Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon). Come for the Hollywood Sign-sized drama\u2014bask in the shade, if you will\u2014but stay for a dive far deeper than the surface scratched by a cat-fight, a look at a film machine built by men, for men and the women it used, abused and spit out the moment the lens caught a wrinkle.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe knows the only time you pay attention to a woman is when she\u2019s in front of a camera,\u201d Wright, as assistant Pauline Jameson, tells Baby Jane director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in Feud\u2019s first episode. The \u201cshe,\u201d in this case, just happens to be one of Aldrich\u2019s many par-for-the-course affairs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intention was never just to make campy, kitschy fun,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how difficult it was for these women in the last 10, 15 years of their lives, at a time when their male counterparts were just beginning, and becoming more distinguished. Their life supply was cut off, really, for both of them, because they turned 50 years old.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Pauline, Wright has the unique task of portraying one of the few Feud roles to not exist in real life. Instead, Pauline operates as an amalgam of the show\u2019s more pressing themes. The assistants who should have been studio heads. The authoritative voices drowned out by the clacking of a secretary\u2019s typewriter. The woman who, quite literally, picked Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? from a pile of ideas and handed it off to a man.\u000a\u000a\u201cPauline is a composite of all the women who worked in the studio systems,\u201d Wright says. \u201cMy character represents a lot of these women who were very great and capable at their job, at a time everyone expected your endgame to be marriage and kids. Pauline wants to be a director. She wants a future in the business.\u201d\u000a\u000aWright\u2019s preparation went beyond adopting an accent; she adopted a mindset. \u201cWhat would it feel like if marriage and kids were not your endgame plan? Because it definitely isn\u2019t for Pauline. Back then, that made you unusual already, right there.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt always blows me away that, in this country, a woman couldn\u2019t have a credit card without her husband until 1974,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cI\u2019d just think about all these things where you would never believe that was actually the case until you actually find out that it was.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich is where Feud takes on an eerie undertone more akin to Murphy\u2019s other anthology series, where it becomes something of an actual American horror story, where you notice the trials and tribulations of that old Hollywood don\u2019t seem too different than those of that new Hollywood.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Wright says, eyes flashing. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. That it\u2019s not any different. Ryan is looking at, well, how far have things actually progressed in these 50, 60 years?\u201d\u000a\u000aBEGIN FLASHBACK:\u000a\u000aINT. 89TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS \u2013 EVENING\u000a\u000aActress BRIE LARSON refuses to applaud onstage as CASEY AFFLECK accepts his Best Actor win amid allegations of sexual assault. MEL GIBSON (choice dialogue: \u201cYou look like a fucking pig in heat,\u201d in reference to ex-wife Oksana Grigorieva) sits in the audience, smiling.\u000a\u000aEND FLASHBACK\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d Wright continues. \u201cSo I know exactly how it is to be a woman and move through the world. So this shit,\u201d referring to Feud, to Baby Jane, to Hollywood, to everything, \u201cit still applies.\u201d\u000a\u000aI ask Wright what first step needs to be taken toward a more inclusive Hollywood, and she tells me that step has already been taken\u2014by none other than Ryan Murphy himself. In early 2016, the uber-producer introduced the Half foundation to his Ryan Murphy Productions, an initiative that promised to fill at least 50 percent of his various shows\u2019 director slots with women. True to his word, Feud\u2019s eight-episode run sees two episodes helmed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton (American Horror Story, The Americans), another from Liza Johnson (Good Girls Revolt) and a penultimate chapter overseen by Oscar-winning actress turned director, Helen Hunt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are more women on Ryan\u2019s set than I have ever seen, anywhere,\u201d Wright tells me. \u201cThere was a woman behind each camera. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Wright\u2014who came to the States 19 years ago and has lived and worked here ever since\u2014the shocking part of this conversation is the fact it\u2019s still a conversation at all. \u201cWomen are half of society, you know?\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the people who are making decisions, or making the content, are all just white guys in their 50s, that\u2019s the only perspective you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is, undoubtedly, a continuous uphill climb. The world did not change after it found out what happened to Baby Jane. This is the same Hollywood in which Sally Fields played Tom Hanks\u2019 mother in Forrest Gump, just six years after playing his love interest in 1988\u2019s Punchline. In which Feud\u2019s own Susan Sarandon (then 67) was old enough to play a 43-year-old Melissa McCarthy\u2019s grandmother in 2014\u2019s Tammy. In which the Hollywood-commanding, billion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe\u201415 films so far and seemingly continuing on into infinity\u2014has yet to use a single female director.\u000a\u000a\u2018Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If [women are] not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cStep one, we just need to get more women onto sets,\u201d Wright says. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is by going out of your way to demand that\u2019s what you want. The studios will bring Ryan, or whoever the director is, a selection of people to choose from. But if there\u2019s no women in that group . . .\u201d\u000a\u000aIf I absolutely had to guess, I\u2019d say the deep sigh that follows has nothing to do with last night\u2019s festivities. But after a moment, unsurprisingly, she is composed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut then, Hollywood and the business is reflective of the world itself. If we\u2019re not equal in the outside world, why would we expect to be treated as equals in the microcosm of Hollywood?\u201d\u000a\u000aCase in point: The time, quite recently, a reality TV star caught on tape detailing his desire to grab a woman \u201cby the pussy\u201d was elected president of the United States. An occurrence that, as fate would have it, landed directly during the production of Feud.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course the election happened right in between shooting,\u201d Wright remembers. \u201cWe all thought it was going to be a certain way. We thought Hillary Clinton was going to be our president. We were going to have a girl in charge. And then it was like, \u2018Oh, no, no, we\u2019re still a very sexist, misogynist country. Let\u2019s not forget that we haven\u2019t traveled that far.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSomething key to note: Throughout our conversation, Wright refrains from mentioning the president by name; she says, simply, \u201ca certain man.\u201d The time before January 20 is \u201cpre-him.\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of this, she says, is to avoid \u201cgiving him his time.\u201d But mostly, it\u2019s a way to separate her work, her art, from burdening politics. Especially Nottage\u2019s Sweat, a play that, on the surface, is a clear-cut mirror of the modern political scene. Set in the industrial town of Reading, Pennsylvania, Sweat focuses on the post-war decline of the working class, of prosperity giving way to uncertainty. Wright plays Jessie, a woman hit hard by sudden unemployment, and harder by the alcohol she uses to forget it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t always get to be a part of something that\u2019s actually important in terms of society and where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d says Wright, the only new cast member added after the play\u2019s Off-Broadway transfer. \u201cBut this is timely, and it\u2019s actually an important piece of art in terms of reflecting back the state of our society at the moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sweat, which Nottage wrote after extensive interviews between 2001 and 2008 with old factory town workers, \u201cis not about the man who is president.\u201d Wright is adamant. \u201cIt\u2019s about the state of the American working class.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s interesting, though, the projects and roles Wright continues to find herself in\u2014Feud, Sweat, The Americans, this interview itself\u2014that require a deeper look than a first glance. That are far, far more than a first impression. It\u2019s the reason Wright\u2019s Martha on The Americans\u2014who began as near-comic relief and ended her run as the epitome of quiet strength\u2014reminds me of Feud\u2019s Pauline Jameson, despite the years and genres between them.\u000a\u000aWright nods at the comparison. \u201cWell, neither of them are the first two women to be underestimated.\u201d And, despite it all, she grins. \u201cOr the last.\u201d

aVIn May of this year, a hot spell broiled Boston. In June, extreme temperatures grounded Phoenix\u2019s planes. Last week, Seattle suffered under record temperatures.\u000a\u000aWhen a heat wave is forecast, the standard advice is to drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks and wear sunscreen. But for extreme heat events, those steps may not be enough.\u000a\u000aOver 30 percent of all weather-related deaths in the United States are attributable to high outdoor temperatures, heat stroke or sunstroke. And heat waves are expected to increase in intensity with climate change.\u000a\u000aHow should U.S. cities prepare for extreme heat events? My research shows that the answer isn\u2019t clear-cut, and that they should pursue multiple solutions rather than looking for one \u201cbest\u201d option.\u000a\u000aHow to cool off\u000a\u000aIn a 2016 article for the Michigan Journal of Sustainability, I explored how Cuyahoga County, Ohio addresses high temperatures. I chose northeast Ohio because it is one of the most vulnerable areas of the United States: The region has an older population, poor-quality housing stock and less central air conditioning than the national average.\u000a\u000aAlthough Cleveland and its suburbs are at risk, public health experts view healthy housing and environmental programs developed there as national models. I also hoped that research results would be useful to other cities in the Great Lakes region.\u000a\u000aI focused on the perceptions of a specific set of people \u2013 professionals from the health, building and urban sectors \u2013 because they have significant influence on how programs and policies are created. Professionals also tend to serve as experts, operating in a middle area between government officials and the public.\u000a\u000aAfter attending numerous municipal meetings, reading reams of policy documents and completing dozens of interviews, I was surprised to find that local professionals disagreed on how to prepare for heat waves. Public health officials felt that cooling centers and air conditioning were critical. Energy efficiency experts wanted to see more funding spent on home energy efficiency. City planners called for increasing tree cover to shade pavement and buildings.\u000a\u000aThis made me wonder: If the experts don\u2019t agree, is there one approach that works better than others?\u000a\u000aActive, passive and urban cooling\u000a\u000aCooling centers and central air conditioning protect people by lowering indoor air temperature and humidity. However, not everyone can access cool locations like libraries or recreation centers during heat waves. Some people have limited mobility or lack access to transportation. For this reason, public health officials often tout residential air conditioning as an important intervention.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, air conditioning is an \u201cactive\u201d system. It requires electricity and doesn\u2019t work when the power is out. This is a problem because as the mercury climbs, blackouts also increase.\u000a\u000aAs a result, building energy efficiency experts are interested in \u201cpassive\u201d cooling systems \u2013 solutions that don\u2019t depend on the electrical grid. Window shades, light-colored building materials and radiant barriers in attics are time-honored techniques. If the power goes out, these systems can still help. This is called improving \u201cpassive survivability.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut while these techniques moderate interior temperatures, indoor conditions are still typically within a few degrees of the outdoor air temperature. This means that if it\u2019s over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in the afternoon, it\u2019s still going to be in the 90°F (32°C) range indoors. Passive systems alone won\u2019t help vulnerable populations like the elderly ride out extreme heat events.\u000a\u000aThis is why city planners advocate for planting street trees to promote urban cooling. Leafy trees and shrubs provide shade and increase evaporation of water from the ground, cooling the air. But like passive systems, these approaches serve only to moderate local temperatures. If a massive heat wave settles over a region, it\u2019s still going to be extremely hot outside.\u000a\u000aSince no approach is foolproof, why not apply apply all of these strategies? One challenge is that with limited funding, there may not be enough money to go around.\u000a\u000aMoreover, these strategies may actually conflict with one another. Air conditioning systems reduce interior temperatures, but they increase household energy consumption, undoing the work of energy efficiency experts. In addition, air conditioners exhaust waste heat from inside houses to the outdoors, further warming surrounding neighborhoods.\u000a\u000aTo address these conflicts, we need to make stronger connections between the environmental health science, building science and urban climate communities. Fortunately, cities like Cleveland are making strides in this direction.\u000a\u000aCollaborative cooling\u000a\u000aWith support from the Kresge Foundation\u2019s Climate Resilience and Urban Opportunity Initiative, the city of Cleveland, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative and the Resilient Buildings Lab at the University at Buffalo recently hosted a series of neighborhood discussions to better understand how climate change will affect Cleveland neighborhoods. One major concern is preparing for future heat waves.\u000a\u000aThe effort, led by Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, generated a series of climate adaptation strategies, including complementary ideas to reduce heat stress at the house, block, neighborhood and city levels. These ideas were incorporated into a climate resilience plan that will guide local efforts through 2018.\u000a\u000aAlthough it\u2019s still early in the process, results from this collaborative effort are encouraging. Community members are engaging with city staff and preparing climate emergency kits to distribute to residents. These kits will contain information on cooling centers, weather radios to keep residents informed, and guidance on stocking food and water to ride out a multi-day emergency without power.\u000a\u000aScholars from university health, architecture and planning departments are also discussing heat preparedness challenges with the Cleveland emergency operations center and local community development corporations. Current efforts focus on setting up additional cooling centers, weatherizing homes and using vacant lots as green space to buffer temperatures.\u000a\u000aIn Cleveland, preparing for extreme heat events has brought professionals together and encouraged overlapping approaches because no single strategy is foolproof. Other cities, like Baltimore and Providence, are working on similar multifaceted approaches.\u000a\u000aNo city wants to repeat what happened in Chicago in 1995, when approximately 700 people died during a week-long heat wave. But with a collaborative approach to heat wave planning, perhaps cities cities can lower the risk of harm from hot weather.\u000a\u000aNicholas Rajkovich an Assistant Professor of Architecture at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.

aVNear Mint, is our weekly comics column where media guru Johnnie Martin discusses all the KAPOW! that\u2019s fit to print. This week: What\u2019s behind the steady increase in strange unions between different worlds?\u000a\u000aWonder Woman meets the Tasmanian Devil? Zorro fighting alongside Django? If you\u2019ve frequented comic shops over the last several years, you\u2019ve probably noticed an uptick in bizarre comics crossovers. Crossovers have always existed in comics\u2014the 1990s is famous for the DC vs. Marvel event that no-one thought possible. But while DC and Marvel are different, that book makes some sense. Two universes of superheroes go together on paper more seamlessly than say, a group of homicidal maniacs and a 1960s zoological rock band; That happened last year, in the form of a Suicide Squad/Banana Splits one shot. Largely, these crossovers are the endpoint of a less diversified corporate entertainment landscape where big business has bought out or merged with lesser ventures. As smaller fish like Marvel and DC have gotten gobbled up by whoppers like Disney and Warner Bros., the flagship characters associated with those companies have gotten the chance to mingle.\u000a\u000aThe culprit behind the majority of these wacko unions has been DC Comics. This past June DC launched six one-shots where heroes from the Justice League Universe fraternized with Looney Tunes. Included: the Batman/Elmer Fudd Special, aptly titled Pway For Me. In Pway For Me the Merrie Melodies cast is reimagined as denizens of the Gotham city underworld: Fudd is a lispy hitman with orders to assassinate Bugs, rendered by artist Lee Weeks as a sad, buck toothed, carrot chewing human. It\u2019s Batman\u2019s job to stop Fudd, and violence ensues. What is oddly satisfying in the best of these books is the way that things are often played very straight faced. While Martian Manhunter meeting Marvin the Martian seems like an obvious union, writer Steve Orlando has Manhunter\u2019s joy at discovering a fellow martian believably crushed by realizations that Marvin\u2019s destructive tendencies make him a very different alien. DC Looney Tunes crossovers were made possible when Warner Bros. merged with Time Inc. in 1989. Any Gen-Xer who grew up with a VHS copy of Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 Batman remembers Bugs Bunny appearing in front of the water tower at the start of the tape. Looney Tunes and DC heroes have actually united before, including in a 2000 Superman & Bugs Bunny four parter.\u000a\u000aThe Hanna Barbera pantheon also found themselves intersecting with the DC heroes this past year, in a series intended to promote DC\u2019s new Hanna Barbera Beyond line of books. Green Lantern met Space Ghost, and the Flintstone\u2019s town of Bedrock received a visit from time traveling super hero Booster Gold. Even some of the sans DC solo Hanna Barbera comics feel like crossovers. Like the 1990s John Goodman vehicle, the Flintstones solo comic is a treatise on the darkness of 1950\u2019s corporate culture\u2014it feels a lot like an episode of Madmen. A DC backup story featuring queer fan favorite Snagglepuss recasts the snazzy pink cat as Tennessee Williams, being interrogated for his plays in a period piece hearkening back to the red scare of McCarthyism. DC accessed Hanna Barbera IP when Turner Broadcasting, the owner of the Hanna Barbera licenses, was purchased by Time Warner in 1996.\u000a\u000aBut why the uptick in weird crossovers now, over twenty years after DC acquired the rights to Looney Tunes and Hanna Barbera? The skeleton key to unlocking this mystery may be the success of crossovers in video games, as well as the related comic Sonic & Megaman: Worlds Collide. Made possible by Archie Comic\u2019s 2011 acquisition of Capcom properties and a longstanding deal with SEGA, This 2013 crossover stars two video game icons past their prime. A speedster hedgehog and a cannon armed astro boy would not seem to match well together but shockingly, the team up ran for twelve issues, and according to writer Ian Flynn, sales were \u201chuge.\u201d World\u2019s Collide was followed by another year long storyline, Worlds Unite, in 2015. Worlds Unite was a full Sega Vs. Capcom moment, with appearances from characters as disparate as Street Fighter\u2019s Ryu and the flying jester from Sega Saturn\u2019s NiGHTS Into Dreams. From the Nintendo brawler, Super Smash Bros. to the Disney/Final Fantasy mashup Kingdom Hearts, staggeringly successful weird crossovers are even more common in video games where mechanics can dictate the narrative. Capcom themselves have crossed over with multiple \u201cVs.\u201d titles, including Marvel Vs. Capcom, Capcom Vs. SNK, and Capcom Vs. Tatsunoko. So using video game characters from a crossover heavy company in a crossover comic might have made things feel smoother than they would have using other intellectual property.\u000a\u000aArchie Comics is also leading the charge with perhaps the strangest crossover of all; 2015\u2019s Archie Vs. Predator. In Archie Vs. Predator, the Riverdale gang takes a trip to Colombia where Betty attracts the attention of a teenage predator alien, who follows them back to suburbia for four issues of murder and mayhem. Written by Alex de Campi, this is a real horror comic drawn in the traditional Archie style but with an even creepier edge. Archie comics has proven time and again that it isn\u2019t too precious with its flagship universe. Everyone from Sarah Palin to Hikaru Sulu has popped up in the pages. Archie even teamed up with Marvel\u2019s The Punisher for a single issue in 1994.\u000a\u000aWhich leads to the question, where is Marvel in all of this zany corporate hijinx? Although known for doing celebrity crossovers (The Avengers once went on Letterman, Spider-Man has met Barack Obama) the house of ideas has stayed mostly out of the weird crossover game in recent years. This is particularly irksome considering Disney\u2019s acquisition of Marvel in 2006. You\u2019d think we\u2019d have the Punisher meeting Bambi by now. But while the Disneyland Tower of Terror is now themed to Guardians of the Galaxy, thus far the closest we\u2019ve come to a comic book alliance is a collection of Marvel limited series based on Disneyland attractions. I don\u2019t know about you, but I wasn\u2019t exactly dying for four issue arcs inspired by the Enchanted Tiki Room or Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Maybe it has something to do with Marvel being considered the more realistic of the big two comics publishers? Another infuriating cross-over was IDW\u2019s X-Files: Conspiracy, which saw the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Crow, the Ghostbusters, and a gaggle of Transformers appearing in the X-Files universe. X-Files: Conspiracy takes as its premise that a disease from the future will destroy the human race unless several urban legends are investigated (the cure involves ninja turtle blood etc.) Sounds great right? The problem is that most of the work is left to X-Files hacker crew the Lone Gunmen, and you never get to see panels where Fox Mulder talks to Raphael or Leonardo. So frustrating.\u000a\u000aHonorable mentions include some DC Comics joint ventures with Boom! Studios, including between Green Lantern and Planet of the Apes, where ape protagonist Cornelius get\u2019s a green power ring. One from the vault is the 1998 novel Planet X, which unites the X-Men with the Next Generation Star Trek cast. Wolverine and Worf share a mutual love of combat, and Picard and Storm share a mutual love for each other. The novel also comments on Picard and Xavier\u2019s similar appearance, shortly before Patrick Stewart was cast in the Professor X role. This was made possible thanks to a deal that licensed Paramount properties to Marvel\u2014a deal which lasted only two years, allegedly thanks to corporate in-fighting.\u000a\u000aWriting about all these different universes is starting to make my head spin. Although I\u2019d like to think these crossovers can happen because corporations set aside their differences to tell great stories, they\u2019re always the result of companies buying each other out, paying up, and utilizing fading properties.

The answer is GLOW, a new Netflix original from Liz Flahive and Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan that chronicles the rise in the 1980s of the real-life upstart organization known as the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (if you don\u2019t have time for Brett Whitcomb\u2019s stellar documentary, settle for this 15-minute montage of every G.L.O.W. wrestler\u2019s signature rap intro and remember to thank me later). Brie stars as Ruth, a struggling, out-of-work actress who finds purpose, and a steady gig, inside the squared circle.\u000a\u000aLike wrestling itself, GLOW is a lot of things at once. An ensemble comedy dressed up in spandex. A meditation on the strength of the female body. A look at what\u2019s changed about racism and sexism since the 1980s and, more importantly, what has remained exactly the same.\u000a\u000aHonestly, define GLOW how you\u2019d like. Just don\u2019t use the word \u201cfake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c \u2018Fake.\u2019 That is the biggest misconception about pro wrestling,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cSo many people have asked me \u2018but the ring is basically a trampoline, right?\u2019 No. No! It\u2019s planks of wood that have a little give with metal in between. I have such a deep respect for it now. For the athleticism, for the showmanship. I certainly get very defensive when people use \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018pro wrestling\u2019 in the same sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer voice drops, becoming far more Macho Man Randy Savage than Vincent Adultman. \u201cI\u2019m immediately like, \u2018I will take you down!\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThat deep respect came courtesy of a four-week crash course prior to production that saw the entire cast\u2014including American Gods MVP Betty Gilpin and resident Mr. Robot hacker Sunita Mani\u2014learning lockups and back bumps from Chavo Guerrero Jr. of the generation-spanning Guerrero wrestling dynasty. It was, Brie says, as grueling as it was emotional; by the time production began, GLOW\u2019s cast was bonded by a shared desire not to drop a co-star on her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much of wrestling is about working together, and nurturing your partner. Their life is in your hands as much as yours is in theirs. And there\u2019s a big leap between learning and \u2018now you just sort of have to do the moves,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cYou can only really talk through this stuff for so long until it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., flip over and land on your back.\u2019 There\u2019s really not a halfway version of that.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s another key thing,\u201d she continues, practically a seasoned ring veteran speaking to a rookie. \u201cCommitment in the ring. When you go halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver the course our conversation it became clear that professional wrestling\u2014\u201creal\u201d or not\u2014has more in common with Hollywood than you would imagine. The bruises, the boiling down to barest stereotypes, even the occasional spandex requirement. If you go to become an actor halfway, that\u2019s when you get hurt.\u000a\u000aTo nab the role of Ruth in GLOW, Brie went anything but halfway.\u000a\u000aWhen Community concluded after six seasons (but no movie), the actress took a full year to read a pile of network pilots but finding nothing to pique her interest. \u201cA lot of the characters I was getting sent for network TV seemed very similar to parts I\u2019ve played before,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted different. \u2018Unique\u2019 was the main word I kept stressing to people.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe parallels to GLOW\u2019s Ruth\u2014an actress searching not just for work but also an identity change, saved by the sudden appearance of a wrestling show\u2014are uncanny, right down to the fact that the studio and producers wanted nothing to do with her. \u201cOf course, the show I\u2019d found and really wanted to do, they didn\u2019t want me for, at all,\u201d Brie says and laughs. \u201cIn fact, I think they were against it. Not only were they not certain, they were adamantly against me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they thought I was edgy enough,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve played these real apple pie characters. I look a certain way. I was looking to change the dialogue about the work I was doing, but they were not privy to that information. So they looked at my résumé and went, \u2018That is not what we\u2019re picturing.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aBrie disagreed. While GLOW\u2019s creative department saw Mad Men\u2019s Trudy Campbell and heard Unikitty from The Lego Movie, the actress herself had a different picture in her head, a fighter with big hair and bigger biceps similar to Sigourney Weaver in Alien (once Brie was cast, she actually did bring a photo of Ripley to hair department head Theraesa Rivers). And she fought. First, to simply get into the audition room, then across several follow-ups with producers Kohan and Flahive, a sojourn to Toronto to get on tape with Gilpin and a return trip Los Angeles for yet another round of auditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was like \u2018pre-read? Yeah! I\u2019ll be there. Anything. I\u2019ll record myself on tape. Whatever,\u2019 \u201d Brie says. \u201cI think at every point they could feel my desperation growing.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs luck would have it, desperation is a staple of Ruth\u2019s personality\u2014of every character on GLOW, in her own way. \u201cRuth is a person who was just tired of feeling invisible,\u201d Brie says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more like Ruth than while I was auditioning for the show. And they saw it. I\u2019ve heard [Liz Flahive] and [executive-producer Carly Mensch] say it: \u2018We were watching you transform into the character as you were fighting for the show.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAs it turns out, the Ruth we get through GLOW\u2019s debut season could only be played by Brie, and the show would tell a different story without her. The actress remembers something Flahivi told her, before they had even met in person. \u201cShe said, \u2018this is a show about women\u2019s bodies.\u2019 \u201d Which is true; GLOW\u2019s cast runs the gamut\u2014color, size, shape\u2014of what a woman can look like. To position Brie, smallest of them all, at the center says a good deal about the relationship between a person\u2019s size and their capacity to stay strong.\u000a\u000aWhich didn\u2019t make the bumps feel better. But it helped.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wrestling really became all about fearlessness,\u201d Brie tells me. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hesitate. You had to just make a decision and do it, do things that were very scary for all of us. But being forced to overcome those fears in an instant, essentially in front of a group of strangers, really empowered all of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aSound advice, for anyone looking to leap into the rigorous trials of Hollywood or simply dive off the top turnbuckle. It\u2019s about fearlessness.\u000a\u000aJust remember to tuck your chin.

aV\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s drizzling rain outside when I meet Ashley Eckstein, the actress who voices the fan favorite animated Star Wars character Ahsoka Tano and founder of the rapidly growing geek girl fashion line Her Universe. But inside Alice\u2019s Tea Cup\u2014her suggestion for tea, scones and restorative afternoon treats\u2014we\u2019ve found a cozy sanctum. Up a colorful rickety staircase, and beneath a glowing chandelier, I\u2019m greeted by Eckstein, who is donning one of Her Universe\u2019s newest designs: a fitted jean jacket embroidered with the Star Wars credo across the back, \u201cMay the Force Be With You.\u201d While Eckstein is only in New York briefly before heading West to check out the new Her Universe offices in Los Angeles now that the company has been acquired by retail giant Hot Topic, and then flying back East to her home in Florida, she happens to be a devoted Alice in Wonderland fan, and so there\u2019s always time for a tea party.\u000a\u000aHaving trouble finding a women\u2019s Star Trek t-shirt, or perhaps a Doctor Who hoodie that is not pink? Her Universe has you covered. The company began as a small t-shirt business in 2010 and has since evolved into an online fashion destination for affordable, diverse and refreshingly chic fan gear for women. Eckstein started Her Universe shortly after she began her voice work as Ahsoka Tano, when a personal search for Star Wars clothing to celebrate her new role left her with unsettlingly few options.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt really started honestly from a selfish place: What would I want? What would I wear?\u201d she tells me, as our tea arrives at the table. Early on, she set out to be different, and established a few rules that have become the core of what makes Her Universe appeal to fangirls. \u201cI love the color pink, but in the beginning [I decided] there would be nothing in our line with the color pink. Female fans, they\u2019d kind of been treated like an afterthought. They would make 20 shirts for guys and one shirt for girls, and it would be in pink and it would say \u2018I Heart Star Wars.\u2019 We\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it, which was at the time unheard of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough pink t-shirts to last a lifetime. I want a black t-shirt with Darth Vader on it.\u201d \u2014 Her Universe founder Ashley Eckstein\u000a\u000aAnd so, Eckstein embarked on an ambitious venture: to create an apparel market for female fans where there was none. She found a manufacturer to partner with, and sought out her first license with Star Wars from Lucasfilm. \u201cI think we started out with 9 t-shirts, and that was it,\u201d she says. As the company grew, it acquired licenses from the Syfy channel, Disney, Marvel, BBC and Studio Ghibli, and expanded its offerings to include sweaters, jackets, dresses, leggings and an accessories line. Browse the Her Universe website and you\u2019ll just as soon find retro-style shirts with Thor, Spider-Man and Loki as you will a black skirt decorated with rainbow lightsaber design and a red, yellow and blue Captain Marvel Jacket. The company\u2019s line is stocked with graphic tees, dresses inspired by characters like Boba Fett and Agent Carter, as well as plus size options and clothes for kids.\u000a\u000aTaking the leap from t-shirts to fashion, meant finding a bigger partner. In 2016, Her Universe became a subsidiary of Hot Topic, though Eckstein still retains full control of the company. The move, she says, has just allowed the company to do more. Today, Her Universe hosts an annual fashion show at San Diego Comic Con, has retail partnerships with brands such as Kohl\u2019s to create a line of activewear, and a publishing imprint. In just a few short years, Eckstein has helped make geek girl gear into an industry.\u000a\u000aFandom has been a part of Eckstein\u2019s life for as long as she can remember, she tells me. Growing up, her father worked for Disney, and her love of Star Wars has always been a constant. She moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and worked in film and television before landing what she calls her \u201cdream come true\u201d role voicing Ahsoka, the first female Jedi to lead a series in the Star Wars franchise, and who has helped pave the way for a new generation of strong female characters like Rey and Jynn Erso. But while women today are more visible in the sci-fi and fantasy world than ever (roughly half of Comic Con attendees are women, and a 2013 survey by Wired found that similar numbers applied to fans of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.) However, in 2008 when Eckstein began her work with the franchise, she found that female fans faced more discrimination and bullying than acceptance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought, this is no way to live your life. Being a sci-fi fan is literally a part of your DNA, it\u2019s a part of who you are. Like I said, to me, I love tea parties, I love Alice in Wonderland, I love cupcakes and I love Star Wars. It\u2019s just a descriptor of who I literally say I am\u2014it\u2019s not a trend.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo while Her Universe is primarily known for its apparel line, it\u2019s also become a tight knit community for fangirls, both online and at comic con conventions and fan events. Eckstein travels constantly, bouncing between her work as Ahsoka and being the public face of her company. Critical to her success has been staying active on social media. Today, Her Universe\u2019s Twitter account has 54,000+ followers, on Instagram 67,000 and the brand reaches across Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr and Snapchat.\u000a\u000a\u201cA big part of our strategy was to go grassroots\u2026to interact with the fans directly,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the girls think they\u2019re talking to me it\u2019s because they are, and it has been from Day 1. It\u2019s just me asking the fans, What do you want?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd what they want, it seems, are options. \u201cWe need [designs] for different aspects of our lifestyle. When you go to work you\u2019re not just going to wear a big logo T. Maybe you\u2019re going to wear a blazer where it\u2019s just a black blazer on the outside, but the lining is lined with Delta shields.\u201d Her Universe now offers exactly that: Behold the open-front Trek Blazer, which is part of the new collection for ThinkGeek.\u000a\u000aWhile Her Universe designs offer wide appeal to the most casual and devoted fans (who doesn\u2019t love R2D2?), creating designs that will appeal to both isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cI did discover there\u2019s a difference between super inside designs that may speak to the hardcore fans, and then you have to offer a design that even casual fans will like to. If you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you can find that design that speaks to both the hardcore fan and the casual fan\u2026that\u2019s like the unicorn design,\u201d says Eckstein.\u000a\u000aHer Universe may have opened the market for geek girl fashion, but it\u2019s no longer the only player in the game. Major companies such as M.A.C. cosmetics and Columbia sportswear have created Star Wars-inspired collections, and Rodarte hit the run way with a line of couture gowns. But Eckstein isn\u2019t intimidated by the competition\u2014far from it, she embraces it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for it because everyone always wants to strive for what they see on the runway, but not everyone can afford that $4,000 dress. So, then they come to companies like ours. We\u2019re known for being affordable fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more mainstream it becomes in fashion, it makes it more acceptable for girls to walk in to work and wear a Star Wars blazer, and for it to be acceptable. And that\u2019s what I want. [For] fans to celebrate their fandom.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow that geek girl has gone mainstream, what\u2019s next? Eckstein has some predictions: \u201cThe Superhero lifestyle and look is on trend. But also\u2014last year we saw it at the Met Gala and we saw it at the Her Universe fashion show\u2014is wearable technology.\u201d The winner of the 2016 Her Universe fashion show used thermochromatic pigment and heating tape to make the Marauder\u2019s Map from Harry Potter appear and disappear on a dress in the time it took to walk the length of the runway.\u000a\u000a\u201cYears ago that would have appeared very geeky in the fashion world\u2026now it\u2019s becoming couture,\u201d she quips. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m excited about that, I think that trend is just starting. We\u2019re seeing it on the runways, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that comes into everyday fashion.\u201d\u000a\u000aEckstein admits that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead before the pop culture world becomes an equal space for female fans and entrepreneurs. But in fashion, the geek girl revolution is well on its way.

aVThe internet has found a way to put a price on dreams, and the market is strong.\u000a\u000aEntrepreneurs have been making an end run around the traditional path to financing startups by raising money with initial coin offerings (ICOs) aggressively. In April, The Economist counted $250 million raised for projects from mining to betting prior to April. Since then, Bancor raised about $147 million for digital financial instruments. Tezos raised $232 million for an Ethereum alternative.\u000a\u000aWe have written about a few ICOs here (and folks have tried to convince us to write about at least eight more so far this month). Brave dropped the Basic Attention Token to fix online advertising. BitBounce will spam the world with Credo. Blockstack will probably release some kind of coin to work within its browser. And Filecoin, the cryptocurrency for cloud storage, will launch its ICO on July 27 [UPDATE: Now August 7]. None of these endeavors have been undertaken by proven companies, though.\u000a\u000aThe first mainstream venture with some miles under its feet to sell a cryptocurrency will probably be Kik, Canada\u2019s unicorn messaging app. Before long, it will release a cryptocurrency called Kin, which it hopes will allow it to turn part of its billion-dollar valuation into spendable cash-money-dollars. If it works, Kik will have shown a way to let people \u201cinvest\u201d without diluting any of the prior investors\u2019 ownership stake.\u000a\u000aWhich is pretty weird.\u000a\u000aKik\u2019s Kin provides us with a chance to explain and explore the evolving world that bitcoin and its derivatives has wrought. It\u2019s going to get pretty abstract, because money itself is an abstraction, but one with very real world effects.\u000a\u000aWhat is Kik and why does it matter?\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re not a cool teen, you can be forgiven for not knowing about Kik. Kik started as a messenger, launching in 2010. In a conversation with Techcrunch\u2019s Jon Russell in China, Kik founder Ted Livingston took credit for basically everything about chat apps that has made them dominant forces on mobile. Americans virtually live on Facebook Messenger and in China, WeChat nearly equivalent with the internet itself. But Livingston says it was Kik that was first to see chat as a platform, layering on bots, communal events and branded pages.\u000a\u000a(The only big innovation that Kik may not be able to claim a piece of is Stories, which is Snapchat\u2019s, and Kik might be the only messaging platform that hasn\u2019t ripped off the popular feature.)\u000a\u000aDespite its innovations, \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to monetize in the Western world,\u201d Livingston tells Russell, because web giants like Facebook and WeChat owner Tencent \u201cgo ahead and give everything away for free\u201d because they can monetize with spying and ads.\u000a\u000aBut Livingston believes Kik can create an economy on (and maybe off) its app, one that rewards developers and users for contributing value to the community. It\u2019s building a system that will watch contributions made to the Kik platform and pay their makers out of its new pool of cryptocurrency for the good stuff they build based on how much activity it generates. Where will that cryptocurrency come from? Well, the Kik team will just make it out of thin air. That\u2019s the beauty of this day and age.\u000a\u000aOr maybe the better word to use is \u201cmoment?\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, what is money anyway?\u000a\u000aFirst of all, we\u2019ll set aside any boring legal issues here. Honestly, if digital money proves to be as valuable as some expect, the law will move to catch up. So forget the law. It\u2019s boring anyway.\u000a\u000aBut can you really just make money out of thin air?\u000a\u000aHonestly, it\u2019s kind of the only way that humans have done it for a long time. First we traded actual stuff (eggs for leather, etc). Then we traded stuff that everyone wanted and was easy to trade (silver, gold, etc). Then we traded tokens that represented commodities like silver or gold (until the 70s, 35 U.S. dollars were exchangeable for an ounce of gold ). Then we just traded the tokens backed by little more than the faith and good will of governments, with names like euros, francs, pesos and dollars.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a bit fuzzier than that. For example, the US Congress requires dollars to be backed by some sort of asset, but that\u2019s mostly just notes on government debt (US Treasuries). At the end of the day, any currency\u2019s value mostly comes down to faith in the nation that originated it.\u000a\u000aThis faith-based cash is \u201cfiat money,\u201d and it\u2019s often referred to derisively among cryptocurrency types. \u201cFiat\u201d is a Latin word for \u201clet it be,\u201d because fiat money is just willed into existence by a nation-state, which also decides how much of that money there is in the world at a given time. Cryptocurrency really isn\u2019t any different, except all it takes is a developer and some server power to make a new one.\u000a\u000aMoney works kind of, sort of like stock in a country\u2019s economy. If you want to visit Baltimore or invest in Ford or buy New Balance sneakers in bulk, you need US dollars to do it. So if people around the world want that stuff, they trade their own currency for dollars, and that increases the price of the dollar versus the yen or the euro or the ruble, none of which have the state of Maryland, the US auto industry or worker-friendly kicks.\u000a\u000aSo in that way, it is like a stock, in that its value changes as the winds of fate blow across the nation that originated the currency, but it\u2019s not like a stock (or \u201cequity\u201d) in that a nation\u2019s currency doesn\u2019t inherently entitle its bearer to, say, input in its legislature, a chunk of land or even an actual vote in an election.\u000a\u000aICOs as investments\u000a\u000aAnd here\u2019s where we get into how an ICO is so different from traditional forms of fundraising. Normally, when a company wants to raise money, it sells a piece of itself (in the form or equity). So if you hear that a company raised $100,000 at a million-dollar valuation, that means it just sold 10 percent of the company to some investor. It\u2019s pretty simple.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not how an ICO necessarily works. Most ICOs these days have created money to be used on some platform. Just as the US government has said that business in our borders has to be conducted in dollars, Kik has the power to say that people who want to trade on its platform need to use Kin to do it. So Kin will work for Kik much like the dollar does for the U.S.\u000a\u000aJust as the dollar reflects how much people want to do business here, Kin will reflect how much people want to do business on Kik. Similarly, just as people who believe the US economy will grow buy and hold dollars to reflect that confidence, people can also invest in Kik by buying Kin, out of a belief that Livingston\u2019s gambit will work.\u000a\u000aBuying Kin does not mean, however, that the currency\u2019s owners hold any rights to Kik. That\u2019s why we put scare-quotes around the word \u201cinvest\u201d when we first mentioned the currency.\u000a\u000aKik is setting aside 30 percent of all Kin for itself (but only letting itself get access to it in chunks over about three years). The idea is that if all this works then the value of that pool will increase. People with a stake in Kik who get Kin out of that pool can hold it or sell it as they see fit. If the Kik economy really takes off, then Kik\u2019s owners should be able to get a nice payday.\u000a\u000aRussell asks Livingston: And then what? If Kin has a hard cap, then how will the company monetize its big expensive platform after their Kin is gone?\u000a\u000aLivingston dodges the question.\u000a\u000aSo where does this all end up?\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not as if private entities haven\u2019t made up their own money before. Usually it happens when the existing form of money doesn\u2019t work well in some piece of the economy. Dollars and yen create a lot of friction online for the applications founders are inventing today.\u000a\u000aWant to buy a cool sticker from someone for about a penny? Forget it. You can\u2019t.\u000a\u000aWant to let people buy tickets to a group chat with a celebrity in a way that they can do it on an impulse? It doesn\u2019t work right now.\u000a\u000aBut fiat money could catch up. If governments issued cryptocurrencies, it would become tough to justify more ICOs. So that\u2019s one possibility.\u000a\u000aBut even if that doesn\u2019t happen, there is also a chance that so many new coins get created that it drives the price of all cryptocurrency down to zero. At the end of the day, all crypto is the same thing: a weird piece of nothingness that only one person can hold at a time. It works as a medium for trade. So even the Useless Ethereum Token has a use. It can be used to buy other cryptocurrencies.\u000a\u000aThe Harvard of startup accelerators, Y Combinator, recently brought in Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO of cryptocurrency investor Polychain Capital, to talk about investing in these new coins. YC staff ask Carlson-Wee why these new startups create new currencies for platforms, such as Brave\u2019s for ads or Filecoin\u2019s for cloud storage.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think there is no strong reason from a technology standpoint,\u201d Carlson-Wee says. \u201cIt\u2019s really more a game theoretic reason.\u201d\u000a\u000aBesides bringing in cash, luring in a bunch of speculators has a way of turning them into users. Online products tend to be better when more people use them. So by drawing in the avaricious, firms can use ICOs to hack their way ahead on scale.\u000a\u000aKik could run just as well on Ethereum proper as on an Ethereum-devised cryptocurrency, with one very important difference: Kik\u2019s vision is to pay independent developers to build new stuff for Kik, but it doesn\u2019t actually have enough cash to pay them (which it would need if it were to pay in Ethereum\u2019s money). Instead, it plans to pay them in a made-up money and hope that money\u2019s value grows enough to make developing for Kik and getting paid in Kin worthwhile.\u000a\u000aBut outside of Kik, Kin will be just another token, inherently no better or worse than bitcoin or BAT or Filecoin. Beyond whatever platform that created it, it\u2019s all just digital money. Right now, the differences between them seem very important, but the more mainstream this stuff becomes, the less important those differences will be, just as the differences between basketball shoes are a big deal to sneakerheads and just shoes to everyone else.\u000a\u000aIf entrepreneurs just keep making new supplies of digital money, the global market could start treating it all as if it\u2019s all basically the same, driving the price of all of it down together.\u000a\u000aIn the worst case scenario, digital cash could become so plentiful that the only thing stopping a kid with some coding skill from creating a new token will be the fact that it isn\u2019t worth his time; however, any time the market calms enough that the economic growth restores some value to existing tokens, it could just be arbitraged out by someone who sees it and creates a new one.\u000a\u000aTrue, the supply for any one digital token can be constrained, but the supply of all digital tokens is infinite and that reality could become a real problem for companies offering coins to power what could be really useful systems.\u000a\u000aWe asked several investors known for backing this space if their teams had discussed this scenario, but we were met with silence.\u000a\u000aSo is this whole sector doomed?\u000a\u000aThat is unlikely.\u000a\u000aThe top seven cryptocurrencies in the world right now have a combined value of $80 billion. That\u2019s a long, long way from zero and it buys the sector a ton of time (especially because it will probably go up much more before it goes down). The analysis in the section above is based on an assumption that nothing else changes. Of course things will change, but we have no idea how.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re headed into Web 3.0, a new era of the internet characterized by mobile connections that will make today\u2019s wired connections look slow, three-dimensional websites, connected devices with super-brains, browsers loaded up with money and UN Secretary General Jeff Bezos.\u000a\u000aNo one in 1993 would have heard a description of Snapchat and believed it could be a $17 billion company one day, but here we are. People are going to come up with some crazy new applications for how that future works, and there\u2019s a decent chance the internet will find some technical consensus that constrains the issuance of digital money in a way that preserves its usefulness (that is, tokens\u2019 value).\u000a\u000aAnd the solution will probably be weird and nearly impossible to anticipate, and that\u2019s why people will keep proclaiming that \u201cbitcoin is dead\u201d over and over until that solution is found.\u000a\u000aAnd entrepreneurs will look back longingly on this era as an online belle époque, when money could be spun up on a server and used to buy real Lamborghinis (or at least rent a Ferrari) not long after. Kik will be one of the first established companies to create its own digital money. If history is any guide, Kik will then be copied. It might not happen many times, though, before the guests enjoying this particular online party find themselves at last call.\u000a\u000aCorrection: A previous version of the story described the US dollar as freely floating, without collateral.

aVIn a blog post last night, Facebook announced the launch of its new video hub Watch, which will be available on desktop, mobile and TV apps. The service will include a feature called Watchlist for users to keep track of new content when it appears on the platform.\u000a\u000aUsers can also personalize Watch by organizing videos into different sections like \u201cMost Talked About,\u201d \u201cWhat Friends Are Watching and \u201cWhat\u2019s Making People Laugh.\u201d\u000a\u000aFacebook\u2019s initial content partners for the launch include NASA, Major League Soccer, Mashable, Quartz, Hearst and McClatchy.

aVWhen entertainment outlets started reporting that Kylie Jenner\u2018s beauty line, Kylie Cosmetics, has made nearly $1 billion in 18 months, seasoned industry observers collectively rolled their eyes. It sounds like the laughably unfeasible boast of a PR person who\u2019s bitten off a bit more than her matte-lipped mouth can chew.\u000a\u000aOne skeptic of this storyline is Dan Barker, a London-based e-commerce and retail expert. \u201cThe numbers feel unrealistically large,\u201d he says. \u201cMy gut instinct is not to trust them.\u201d So Barker went in search of the real story.\u000a\u000aThe claim from Jenner\u2019s mom, Kris, is that Kylie Cosmetics has sold $420 million worth of product since its launch 18 months ago. Barker puts this suggestion into context by comparing it to Burt\u2019s Bees\u2019 last publicly available figures. Those showed $250 million in annual revenue, just before the company was acquired for $925 million.\u000a\u000aIs it possible Kylie Cosmetics is already doing twice as much business as one of the beauty industry\u2019s stalwart brands? According to Barker\u2019s research, there are strong indicators that Kylie Cosmetics\u2019 success is such that the notoriously shy baby sister is now worth more on paper than anyone else in her family.\u000a\u000aAssuming Kylie\u2019s sales have trended evenly\u2014no spikes or dips\u2014for the last 18 months, her revenue for 2017 would total $280 million. But numbers cited elsewhere indicate that business has not plateaued at all. Indeed, forecasts showing Kylie Cosmetics on-target to sell $390 million worth of products this year reveal that the company has continued to drive massive growth. \u201cA big chunk of sales seem to come through the Kylie Cosmetics website,\u201d says Barker\u2014sales on which the company would likely make a higher margin versus sales from intermediary retailers.\u000a\u000aIf the same margins and acquisitional market that applied to Burt\u2019s Bees were applied to Kylie Cosmetics, the company\u2019s valuation would be well over $1 billion. As unbelievable as it may sound, her booming brand further indicates that Kylie Jenner is on course to become her family\u2019s first billionaire. At that point, she will have a higher net worth than her sister Kim Kardashian-West and Kim\u2019s husband Kanye West combined.\u000a\u000aNot bad for the quiet, socially awkward little sister in a family full of brazen hustlers. And not bad for a beauty brand that, apart from Jenner\u2019s own occasional pop-up shops, isn\u2019t even sold in retail stores. So how did she do it?\u000a\u000aThe first smart move Jenner made was partnering with brand incubator Seed Beauty. Helmed by Laura Nelson, Seed puts traditional celebrity licensing deals to shame. Rather than slapping a celeb\u2019s name and face on a white-label product, the company works with them to build the brand and its products from square one. Another Seed-built brand is ColourPop, which brings on-trend, affordable products to consumers within days of identifying a new fad. The fact that Seed took ColourPop from concept to launch in three months is an indication of how quickly their model progresses growth.\u000a\u000aLuckily for Jenner, Seed is able to produce products at breakneck speed. According to Barker\u2019s research, Kylie Cosmetics has sold at least 10 million products since launch. \u201cThe average price of an item from Kylie Cosmetics is roughly $36,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most expensive product is $325. To make $420 million, the brand would had to have sold 11.7 million average-priced products\u2014or 1.29 million of her most expensive product.\u201d Assuming a mix across the range, Barker\u2019s estimate seems conservative.\u000a\u000aThat means that Jenner\u2019s brand has sold approximately 560,000 units per month\u2014or 18,250 products every day. \u201cOver the whole 18 months, Kylie Cosmetics has sold an average of one product per five seconds or less,\u201d Barker reports. That\u2019s more than a dozen products sold every minute.\u000a\u000aBut is this kind of meteoric growth something Jenner and the Seed Beauty team can maintain? Barker\u2019s research indicates that interest in the brand has recently declined somewhat (though perhaps the billion-dollar company story will fix that). He examined how consumer interest in Kylie Cosmetics is tracking against other major beauty companies, low-budget and luxury brands alike. Despite the slight downward trend, Barker concludes, Kylie Cosmetics is still roughly on par with competitors like NARS in terms of monthly searches. Unsurprisingly, the same data shows interest in Kylie Cosmetics has spiked to more than 100 percent more than that of more traditional brands like Burt\u2019s Bees.\u000a\u000aThe proof of the brand\u2019s stability will come over the next quarter, Barker predicts. \u201cHolidays and big launches are usually the most crucial periods for brands like this. It looks like Kylie Cosmetics launches in 2017 have been a little less in-demand compared to last year, at least within Google Trends\u2019 data. So the holiday season will be a key period to see whether the brand will pick up or see its growth taper off.\u201d\u000a\u000aJackie Danicki created one of the first and most popular beauty blogs in 2004 and has consulted some of the world\u2019s most iconic brands on digital content strategy and innovation.

aVAs Conde Nast looks set to announce consolidation of its publishing division following similar changes at Hearst Magazines last year, other, smaller players in the sector have better news. New York-based niche magazine, Paper, just celebrated its 32nd successful year in print. Meanwhile, in Munich, Germany, Platea, an independent art and fashion magazine, rejoiced its snowballing readership. The quarterly magazine targeted at young creatives has been in business for less than two years and already garnered a loyal audience within Europe. Likewise, The Gentlewoman, a magazine based in London aimed at intellectual women with \u201cstyle and purpose,\u201d has been growing exponentially throughout a seven year run.\u000a\u000aVestoj, Dazed and Confused, Love, Kinfolk, V, Interview, and System are independent magazines, some names less familiar than others, enjoying growing success while their mainstream counterparts such as Instyle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan have shown a consistent drop in circulation. At a time when print is seemingly waning with many titles now transitioning to digital-only, the success of mainly fashion-based indie magazines seems puzzling. Yet, a quick look through any of them reveals one simple ingredient: contemporary voices and a deeper connection with the audience. The content and design appeals to those attracted by new, avant-garde inspiration and is unfettered by fashion advertising behemoths. This is not to say though, that fashion brands are not on board. Many are lining up for space in the most influential spots and the kudos of appearing alongside raw, emerging talent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cNiche and indie magazines are very in touch with their audience, they tend to be lean mean fighting machines, often run by a single person who can nimbly engage with their audience far more easily than a mainstream magazine that\u2019s often weighed down by too many people involved in the decision making & production process,\u201d James Hyman told observer.com. Hyman is founder of The Hyman Archive in London, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest collection of magazines.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost independent titles consist of small teams, often dispersed across different parts of the world. Instead of self-aggrandizing and building personal brands, niche editors are motivated by a sense of purpose and enthusiasm for their publication\u2019s cultural role. The key word here is \u2018niche,\u2019 something most commercial fashion magazines have lost sight of, with far too many similarities between them. \u201c[Independent] magazines have smaller teams and lower overheads, and are published less often. Smaller teams mean more focused, controlled decision-making. The mainstream, on the other hand, has commoditized itself and become repetitive, and more concerned with business rather than being creatively focused,\u201d explained Jeremy Leslie, creative director at MagCulture, one of the most respected magazine stores in London stocking over 350 different titles.\u000a\u000aHe added that most mainstream magazines are now at a point where they don\u2019t have a voice of their own and have become clones in terms of both character and physical nature, \u201c [They\u2019re] all the same size, same paper, same number of pages. Straight in the recycle bin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertising pressures are one of the top reasons for the decline in the quality of content in traditional print titles. A source close to I-D, a British art, fashion and youth culture magazine confirmed how it lost a chunk of its readership as their content became more commercially driven, after being bought by Vice in 2012, a multimedia company partly owned by Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new I-D magazine is just another place to view cool work\u2014no thoughtful criticism or fascinating narrative that once made it worth reading,\u201d noted an agitated user on a reddit thread.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you need to please advertisers, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to take risks and when you\u2019re aiming for demographics, you\u2019re not going to go out on a limb and do something really different,\u201d said Steven Watson, founder at Stack Magazines, a subscription service that selects and delivers new, independent titles to users every month.\u000a\u000aAlthough independent publications don\u2019t have mighty commercial obligations at their heels, they do need support. Penny Martin of The Gentlewoman, noted that although they are growing, with \u201ca very healthy advertising quotient of around 30 percent,\u201d they don\u2019t let that interfere with the content, \u201cWe are working with companies who respect our independent ideals and understand that a magazine publishing long form articles and lavishing space on typography and design has fewer pages to display product.\u201d\u000a\u000aTypically created with an immense attention to detail plus great design and photography and in some cases better paper quality\u2014some small titles become minor works of art. \u201cI wanted to do print to have a platform to cherish the content I collect. It has a stronger appearance and is more special. It doesn\u2019t get thrown away. Crafting magazines is an art form and a lot of people are involved and brought together to create something that you can touch and feel. It\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Tristan Boettcher, editor in chief at Platea.\u000a\u000aWatson added that the superior quality of these young titles has made them a luxury product and more collectible than the old guard. \u201cIt\u2019s in part a response to the mainstream which over the last 10 years has reduced the thickness of the paper to make it cheaper and reduced the budgets because of falling revenues. So now a group of independent magazine makers have decided, \u2018Magazines don\u2019t have to be like this, we can print magazines in beautiful thick paper, with beautiful typography and design and we could charge £10 for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy becoming an indispensable item, the indie magazine circuit is also winning the print versus digital debate, where online media just can\u2019t offer the quality or longevity that these publications do.\u000a\u000aWatson argued that niche publications don\u2019t see digital as competition or a threat but as a tool to further their own popularity. \u201cI think it\u2019s really about what makes your product different from everything else. Build everything around that thing. Then not only does it become something that you can\u2019t get online, you can\u2019t get that anywhere else. That is really the magic of these publications.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis doesn\u2019t mean the bells are tolling for all traditional magazines. U.S Vogue, for instance, consistently re-invents content, featuring youthfully influential and diverse personalities and blasting a hole in tradition with the controversial but ultimately successful, Kimye cover. Modern publishing requires a rethinking of purpose. Leslie advised that it is all about striking a balance between familiarity and repetition, and celebrating the possibilities of the manufacturing process without losing its uniqueness, \u201cCreatively, print is bang in the center of a hugely innovative golden age. Just be sure of your magazine\u2019s point of view and personality and don\u2019t be a cheap copy.\u201d

aVYears ago, I was working on a story about NowThis, the social video company. One of my sources compared 2014\u2019s ice bucket challenge phenomenon on Facebook to the Gulf War on CNN, arguing that the events showed each company why it existed in this world. The story never came together, but during that reporting many people told me that the day would come when Facebook (and other social networks) would be a major source of revenue for people who published video online.\u000a\u000aI doubt any of those pontificators thought it would take this long. NowThis pre-dated the ice bucket challenge, but those events must have made that team believe that any day Facebook would roll out a systematic way for video publishers to share in the oceans of money pouring into social networks for ads.\u000a\u000aFinally, Facebook has announced that wide open program to monetize video on the world\u2019s largest social network. Zuck \u201chopes you enjoy!\u201d Content makers will earn 55 percent of the ad revenue from their stuff, if they choose to include ad breaks. Menlo Park is calling it \u201cWatch,\u201d according to TechCrunch. It might have happened sooner if Facebook weren\u2019t so lousy at keeping track of video views.\u000a\u000aSince the days of ice cube and water dumping, a plethora of companies have sprung up to make Facebook friendly video, and lots of them follow a familiar formula. It\u2019s no accident that I never wrote \u201cvideo makers\u201d in the paragraphs above, by the way. \u201cVideo publishers\u201d really more accurately describes what most of these companies do. Early on, NowThis actually had a great staff of producers and talent making funny videos that commented on the news, but it wasn\u2019t long till it dropped the original aspect and shifted to adding text atop video plucked off the wires.\u000a\u000aNow, that format\u2019s everywhere. Especially on Facebook.\u000a\u000aMore and more people and companies are diving into making video Facebook\u2019s way. Business Insider reports that Buzzfeed and Condé Nast are among the launch partners for its new video effort, which is rolling out gradually to Facebook users. In March, we spoke to a young company aiming to be the Condé Nast of online video, Nameless Networks. Its site indicates that it has six distinct channels, each with their own unique voices, focused on topics like women, dogs and nostalgia.\u000a\u000aWe previously wrote about the company when it was making a new commenting system for video, but it has pivoted to making these Facebook-ready shorts. \u201cWe honestly thought that having a website wasn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d Kareem Rahma, Nameless\u2019s CEO told the Observer in a phone call. New companies can\u2019t get attention onto new URLs and so Nameless has built a business around never asking fans to leave the social network, \u201cWhich Facebook hates,\u201d Rahma said.\u000a\u000a\u201cTons of emerging markets think Facebook and the internet are synonymous,\u201d Alex Serio, Nameless\u2019s chief content officer told us. \u201cWe believe that Facebook has become the medium as well as the message.\u201d\u000a\u000aBen Lerer is the founder of Thrillist, and his company has made the same bet. He\u2019s also the son of Ken Lerer, whose company Lerer Hippeau Ventures also backed NowThis. We saw the younger Lerer speak at at event sponsored by Cornell and Bloomberg, where he described Facebook as the new Comcast, the builder of the windows through which most people will watch video content.\u000a\u000aIn that way, Facebook pages are the new cable channels. \u201cToday, Thrillist is a brand that is trying to be building a new cable network,\u201d Lerer said.\u000a\u000aIronically, even if Lerer is right, Comcast probably still will be one of the main companies that actually delivers the lion\u2019s share of that content to most people\u2019s homes, even if they watch it through Facebook\u2019s mobile or web apps. And Facebook has some really big differences from Comcast\u2019s business model.\u000a\u000aComcast\u2019s interests and that of the channels that ride on its cables really do align well. The main thing Comcast wants is your monthly cable bill to get paid. It doesn\u2019t really care whether you watch ESPN or Comedy Central, just so long as you watch enough that you\u2019re likely to want to pay Comcast again the next month.\u000a\u000aWith Facebook, it\u2019s much more muddled. By controlling people\u2019s feeds, it effectively has a finger on their remote control. By selling the ad itself and choosing which videos gets which ads, Facebook effectively also controls the business departments at the site\u2019s equivalents to MTV and CNN (which probably will be MTV and CNN, as it happens). Facebook has control over so many facets of this distribution model that viewers and producers are little more than pinballs inside Zuckerberg\u2019s arcade.\u000a\u000aAnd the games in there aren\u2019t even that good. In May, we shared a video commentary by Alan Ginsburg, a filmmaker who breaks down why he believes Facebook has ruined video online.\u000a\u000aWe spoke to Ginsburg by phone about Watch, and he was reluctant to say much until he got a chance to have a look at it, and it hasn\u2019t rolled out to his device yet. That said, he had some big questions about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow is Facebook going to prioritize the content you see and the content you don\u2019t see?\u201d he asked. When Facebook rolled out pages, publishers started building up their fan followings on those pages because it helped drive traffic. Then, Facebook started deprecating pages\u2019 content in people\u2019s feeds, so publishers had to pay to get seen by their own audience. Will Watch be the same? Will video publishers build up an audience only to have Facebook tell them that they need to pay money to reach it?\u000a\u000aGinsburg also worries about piracy now that Facebook will pay people to make video. That will create a strong incentive for people to steal and remix other people\u2019s video without their permission. That\u2019s already happening on Facebook now, but the site doesn\u2019t pay them for those views. \u201cOnce you start putting in ad revenue, that gets a lot more serious,\u201d Ginsburg said.\u000a\u000aThese points could make Watch sound more dramatic than it really is, because let\u2019s all be honest: these Facebook videos are really bad. It\u2019s depressing that smart, talented people are devoting their lives to making them. Maybe by focusing in on video, the stuff posted on Facebook will gradually become less schlocky, but it could also get worse. Ginsburg argued that Facebook really wants those engagement numbers. So it would probably prefer that you watched six two minute videos over one 20 minute deep dive.\u000a\u000aIf that\u2019s the case, what kind of videos do we expect that to yield? Facebook video could easily devolve into something that makes listicles look Pulitzer-worthy.\u000a\u000aBut there\u2019s also the very real possibility that Facebook\u2019s video effort doesn\u2019t matter any more than its attempt at news did. Watch could just yield videos that people don\u2019t really watch, just like they don\u2019t really watch them right now (even if we do sort of let them play for a few seconds as we scroll through our feeds). Maybe Facebook really is the next Comcast or maybe there really is only so much of this crud that people can be distracted by.\u000a\u000aI hate to throw cold water on the hopes of so many with a dream to make a living from monetizing creative work, but it\u2019s fitting.\u000a\u000aThrowing cold water started this trend in the first place.

aVCould Ruth Negga pull an upset on Sunday night at the Academy Awards? The Ethiopian-Irish actress doesn\u2019t have her knickers in a twist over it \u2013 the stunningLoving lead, 35, is on a collision course with stardom and, win or lose, doors are swinging open in Hollywood. The petite actress removed her Prada heels and dug in with the Observer to discuss her extraordinarily ordinary heroine. Mildred Loving, a modest Black woman who married a white man in 1958 and courageously battled the Virginia anti-miscegenation laws for love, equity and the fundamental right for a man and a woman to have a family in the United States.\u000a\u000aWould you call yourself brave?\u000a\u000aRuth Negga: Definitely not. I\u2019m the scaredy-est cat I know. I would hope I\u2019d be brave and that in certain situations, when it would call for it, that I would stand up. But am I tough? I can be quite tough \u2013 but it\u2019s not angry small women\u2019s syndrome.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not?\u000a\u000aNo, it\u2019s not. When you\u2019re small and people address you in that patronizing way, and you think please don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t think being brave and being tough are necessarily mutually exclusive, but you can be either or in certain situations. No one is any one trait 24/7. In order to be brave you need to understand what it is to be fearful. Isn\u2019t that what they say?\u000a\u000aDo you consider Mildred Loving brave?\u000a\u000aAbsolutely! I think she\u2019s brave, but I don\u2019t know if Mildred thought that she was brave. And I can only access that. I had to leave my thoughts out, because I was playing her. For Mildred, she was just pursuing her right to justice. I don\u2019t think she thought it would take nine years. Can you imagine? Every step of the way, she was just doing, and I think sometimes just getting on with things and doing are extraordinary acts of bravery.\u000a\u000aCan you elaborate?\u000a\u000aAnyone who\u2019s had to confront a situation where they feel like they had to fight a little harder, or overcome obstacles, it becomes second nature. Nothing\u2019s going to be handed to you, so in a weird way, you develop this amazing not even a work ethic, but you\u2019re like a Duracell battery. You\u2019ll outlast everyone. You have the ability \u2013you just need the opportunity. The opportunities have to be there. That\u2019s all that people need.\u000a\u000aWhen did opportunity first knock in your own career?\u000a\u000aI was very lucky to get a job right out of college in Dublin [Trinity College\u2019s The Samuel Beckett Centre]. Just before I graduated, Annie Ryan cast me as the title character in a stage version of Nabokov\u2019s Lolita. It\u2019s one of my favorite books. It\u2019s amazing and horrifying \u2014 and this was amazing and horrifying.\u000a\u000aDo you see the lover and the monster in the lecherous character Humbert Humbert, who would now likely be on the sex offender registry?\u000a\u000aIt scares us because we see that those things can live side by side within certain people. It\u2019s scary because we don\u2019t want to know that we can be capable of grotesque acts. I think we\u2019re desperate, aren\u2019t we, to iron out nuances and complexities in life because we think it makes life more palatable. But, in fact, it\u2019s just making it more difficult because it\u2019s luring us down the primrose path, which is wrong. It means that we understand each other less and less and ourselves less and less, because if we forgo the nuance, then we\u2019re just not going to make any progress.\u000a\u000aYou definitely explore the dark side in your violent, volatile comic-book anti-heroine Tulip O\u2019Hare in the AMC TV series Preacher.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s something grotesque about Tulip. I wanted her face to even be grotesque sometimes. But still be peculiarly magnetic and sexy and, like, everything that women are rarely allowed to be on our screens \u2014 because we are in real life. Like me and my girls, like we were all of those things. I I thought I\u2019d like to contribute to that broadening of female roles. Tulip\u2019s fun and she\u2019s feisty. And then she\u2019s not so fun and she\u2019s not so feisty. I embrace the complexity and nuances \u2014 and that she\u2019s funny. I find her funny.\u000a\u000aOne of your signature qualities is large expressive eyes out of proportion to your frame.\u000a\u000aI have a real sticky face. I have no poker face. It\u2019s actually handy being an actress, though. I\u2019ll take the lack of poker face.\u000a\u000aWhat did you take away from living in Mildred\u2019s shoes?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think I can sum it up in a sentence, really. I think that anyone who worked on this film surrounded by those two people, Mildred and Richard Loving, can\u2019t help but find their goodness infectious, and aspirational. I think I\u2019ve internalized it for my heart. Mildred\u2019s still there. Some characters stay with you for a while; others, I find their scent gets less strong. Some people are forever etched into you.\u000a\u000aLike Mildred Loving?\u000a\u000aVery much so.

aVIt was almost two years ago that Trevor Noah was hired to tell jokes on The Daily Show. Unfortunately, Noah instead became the butt of jokes. While taking over Jon Stewart\u2019s duties on Comedy Central\u2019s show was certainly a daunting task, Noah probably didn\u2019t foresee the vitriol that would be aimed at him. And it wasn\u2019t just from the right.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery night on The Daily Show, Noah fluffs lines. He is reading copy off a teleprompter\u2014copy that he\u2019s gone over several times before the show airs\u2014but he just can\u2019t nail it consistently,\u201d claimed the Huffington Post.\u000a\u000aSalon blatantly asked for Comedy Central to fire Noah. \u201cIf Millennials are truly eating up Trevor Noah, then an entire generation is suffering from comedy malnutrition,\u201d wrote New York Daily News columnist Gersh Kuntzman, who called Noah \u201ca flop.\u201d Ouch!\u000a\u000aThose, of course, were a couple of the nicer things printed about Noah, but not many. Then, something happened. Something changed. Donald Trump was elected, and before too long, Noah\u2019s ratings had significantly increased. He went from being a comedy zero to a late night comedy hero. After Trump\u2019s election, the ridicule changed into raves.\u000a\u000aOne particular turning point for Mr. Noah occurred conservative pundit Tomi Lahren was invited to the show. As The Atlantic points out, Noah was able to take on Lahren without resorting to screaming and personal insults, something that is rare in today\u2019s media world. He was able to respectfully argue with Lahren about comparing the Black Lives Matter movement to the KKK. Since the confrontation, Noah has proven capable of making his audience think, rather than just pumping them up with outrage. After finally finding his audience, Trevor Noah has been able to hit The Daily Show ratings out of the ball park.\u000a\u000aWhile Noah is obviously more comfortable in his hosting duties, one can\u2019t deny that Trump\u2019s election gave him a huge boost. Of course, Trevor Noah wouldn\u2019t be the only one experiencing a late night revival thanks to the results of the election. Stephen Colbert also launched The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS to a rocky start. As Variety explains, Colbert had been used to playing a right-wing parody character of himself. The new network talk show hosting gig didn\u2019t seem to suit him, at least in the beginning.\u000a\u000aColbert was improving somewhat just before November 8, but the election upset was the major turning point. According to The New York Times, Chris Litch, the executive producer of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, walked up to Colbert on that eventful evening and told him, \u201cStop being funny and go and just be real.\u201d Litch credits that moment for Colbert\u2019s professional turnaround.\u000a\u000aIn fact, Colbert\u2019s show narrowly beat The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon for the 2016-2017 broadcast season as the most watched late night talk show. Colbert\u2019s recent \u201cRussia Week\u201d series helped his show take over an even wider lead. However, it\u2019s also true that Fallon has, for the most part, been leading in the much sought-after 25 to 54 age group for advertisers.\u000a\u000aThe biggest winner of Donald Trump\u2019s election is Saturday Night Live, a show that hasn\u2019t been considered relevant in years according to many longtime viewers. Alec Baldwin was getting acclaim for his Donald Trump impersonation before the election, but his new presidential character took on a whole new meaning and importance after the election. Of course, besides doing a spot-on imitation of Donald Trump, Baldwin has also brought Bill O\u2019Reilly into the mix.\u000a\u000aSNL has become the place where Trump haters seek solace. It has become a place for the disgruntled to escape what they consider a nightmare. Baldwin isn\u2019t the only one pushing the show to its greatest ratings in 23 years. There\u2019s Melissa McCarthy and her cartoonish take on the former white house secretary Sean Spicer, and Kate McKinnon\u2019s pivot from playing Hillary Clinton to lampooning Kellyanne Conway has also been a highlight for viewers.\u000a\u000aRight now, things are looking great for the anti-Trump late night comedy crowd, and the ratings along with record-breaking Emmy nominations prove it. But how much longer can the Trump bump last? Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump imitation could have an expiration date if he doesn\u2019t change things up a little bit. Trevor Noah has certainly won over the Trump-hating crowd, but will his over-the-top jokes about the current administration reach a saturation point? Colbert\u2019s show was in the lead recently, but just over a month ago, Fallon was back in the driver\u2019s seat.\u000a\u000aThe constant turnover of Trump\u2019s administration is providing more characters for SNL and others to lampoon, and the administration\u2019s problems, especially with Russia, keep easily filling up scripts. Late night comedy shows will continue their success if they keep pushing and adapting without resting on their current laurels.

aVOf course the Boss was the one who finally figured out how to stop bots and scalpers.\u000a\u000aFans who wanted to snag tickets for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 2016 tour found that shows were sold out within seconds of being posted for sale. At the same time, resale sites like StubHub offered those same seats at sky-high prices.\u000a\u000aHow did that happen? The culprit, as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman discovered last year, was ticket bots. Brokers used bots (a special automated software) to scoop up as many tickets as possible, then offered them on resale sites at markups up to 1,000 percent. Schneiderman found that tens of thousands of tickets were acquired each year using the software.\u000a\u000aArtists like Springsteen and Lin-Manuel Miranda railed against ticket bots along with consumers, and their voices were heard\u2014President Obama signed a bill outlawing bots in December.\u000a\u000aBut New Jersey\u2019s favorite son isn\u2019t taking any chances: he\u2019s still fighting the bots, now with Ticketmaster\u2019s help.\u000a\u000aToday he announced Springsteen on Broadway, an eight-week limited engagement at the 960-seat Walter Kerr Theatre. The show will run five nights a week, Tuesday through Saturday, from October 3 to November 26.\u000a\u000aSpringsteen will perform solo on guitar and piano\u2014he\u2019ll also read excerpts from his 2016 autobiography Born to Run. The New York Post first leaked rumors about the Broadway show in June.\u000a\u000aTicketmaster isn\u2019t gonna let just anyone (human or otherwise) see the show, however. It\u2019s using a new technology called Verified Fan to weed out bots and scalpers. The system, which Ticketmaster has been using on and off since February, asks prospective buyers to register in advance\u2014and it even checks users\u2019 purchase histories and social media activity to confirm their legitimacy.\u000a\u000aBetween now and August 27, Springsteen fans can log in with their Ticketmaster account and submit their information. Verified, randomly selected fans will then receive a text message on Wednesday, August 30 before 10 AM ET (when tickets go on sale). The text will include a unique offer code for users to unlock tickets (which will cost $75 to $850).\u000a\u000aThere are several caveats: the website notes that registering \u201cdoes not guarantee you will be verified, receive a code or have the ability to access tickets.\u201d And to allow as many fans as possible to enjoy the show, there is a two ticket maximum per purchase.\u000a\u000aWhile the bot industry may never be fully eliminated, Ticketmaster says 90 percent of the tickets sold through Verified Fan were kept off secondary markets.\u000a\u000aSpringsteen on Broadway isn\u2019t the only high profile show using Verified Fan. Producers of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the hit London play coming to New York this spring, announced last week that it would also utilize the service to keep bots and scalpers out.\u000a\u000aRegistration for Cursed Child runs from October 1 to October 5, and tickets go on sale October 12 at 11 AM. It will use the same randomized selection process as Springsteen on Broadway, and the same caveats apply.\u000a\u000aSo if you want to sing along with \u201cBorn to Run\u201d or see Harry, Ron and Hermione\u2019s latest adventure, you\u2019d better have luck on your side.

aVAs President Donald Trump is set to visit New York City next week, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito says he may have the right to come but that his values are \u201cnot welcome here\u201d in New York City. And she\u2019s \u201cready\u201d to join any potential protests that day.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, while on his 17-day vacation at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., Trump announced on Twitter that he is planning to go to New York City next week \u201cfor more meetings.\u201d At the time, his spokeswoman said that they would provide more details \u201cin the next day or two.\u201d\u000a\u000aPOLITICO, however, obtained a draft schedule indicating that he will go to Trump Tower on Sunday afternoon and stay there for three nights. The schedule also said that he will have \u201cinternal meetings\u201d at this Fifth Avenue headquarters on Monday and Tuesday and head back to Bedminster on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aMark-Viverito \u2014 who has been a vocal critic of the administration since Trump was elected \u2014 said that she has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the ability of the NYPD to handle security while Trump is in the city and that people have the right to express themselves.\u000a\u000a\u201cI project that there will be some people probably protesting,\u201d Mark-Viverito said at her monthly pre-stated meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to protest.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd she said she is \u201cready\u201d to join any protests that may be taking place that day. While she believes that Trump is entitled to visit the city, it does not necessarily mean that he will be greeted with smiles. She said that what the city strives for is to be an \u201cinclusive city,\u201d a notion that she believes Trump \u201ccompletely rejects,\u201d calling it \u201cvery unfortunate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe he incorporates any of our values and I know there\u2019s a large number of people that did not vote for him, therefore I believe he\u2019s not welcome here,\u201d Mark-Viverito continued. \u201cHe has the right to come here but in terms of his values and what he brings with him, it\u2019s definitely not what we welcome in this city.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump has visited New York City once since he became president, when he appeared aboard the historic U.S.S. Intrepid along with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, with whom he had clashed over the phone back in February. Hundreds of demonstrators, led by the labor-backed Working Families Party, liberal veterans group Common Defense and a host of local elected officials, rallied in DeWitt Clinton Park. They subsequently marched several blocks south.\u000a\u000aIn December 2016, Mark-Viverito and Mayor Bill de Blasio sent letters to President Barack Obama and Congress asking them to reimburse the city for up to $35 million that it spent for the period between Election Day on Nov. 8 and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 protecting Trump and his family at Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aOn the last day of April, the trillion-dollar Omnibus Appropriations Act introduced on Sunday included $68 million for states and localities that protect the president and his family. Most of the money was allocated to Florida, where the president spends a lot of time at his Mar-a-Lago resort, and to New York\u2014where First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron Trump where staying until the end of the current school year. They moved into the White House in June.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio said at an unrelated press conference on Monday that the NYPD \u201cis the most expert police force on Earth\u201d when it comes to handling visits by an American president, insisting that they \u201cdo an outstanding job.\u201d He said they will \u201cbe ready by any measure\u201d and that Trump has visited the city \u201ca lot less than we expected.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe expected President Trump might be back a lot,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cHe\u2019s only been back once previously and to his credit, he kept the time here very limited and the disruption very limited, so hopefully that will be he same this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NYPD, for its part, said it is working with the U.S. Secret Service to prepare for Trump\u2019s visit.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda has included executive orders barring entry to people from Muslim-majority countries, a proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border and expanded immigration detention. Mark-Viverito has participated in a number of protests and demonstrations against various Trump polices affecting marginalized groups, including immigrants, LGBTQ individuals and the Muslim community.\u000a\u000aIn January, Trump announced an executive order that would withhold funding for so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Following his election, he threatened to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants he claimed are criminals.\u000a\u000aMark-Viverito and Brooklyn Councilmen Brad Lander and Carlos Menchaca \u2014 chairman of the Council\u2019s Committee on Immigration \u2014 subsequently introduced a resolution reaffirming the Council\u2019s commitment to keeping the five boroughs a safe haven for all people, regardless of their legal status. The Council passed the resolution.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio has also said the city would remain a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d though some advocates say undocumented immigrants arrested for low-level offenses are at risk of deportation on the grounds that federal immigration authorities can access their information.\u000a\u000aIn response to news Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over its \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies, de Blasio said they are \u201cready join in legal action\u201d if there is a specific effort to withhold funds.

aVIn law, there is a saying: \u201cBad cases make bad law.\u201d A situation is developing that will make bad law relating to the revocations of presidential designations of national monuments.\u000a\u000aControversy is brewing over President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of the Interior\u2019s review of a flurry of national monument designations made during Barack Obama\u2019s final days in office. A good case can be made that Obama went too far with his last-minute designations of monuments, but the law that enables a president to make these designations was drafted in a way that only Congress\u2014not a subsequent president\u2014can remove designations once they are made.\u000a\u000aThe Constitution is clear when it maps out the powers of each branch of government. Article I puts forth the law making powers of Congress and Article II put forth the powers of the executive branch. Once Congress passes a bill, the president signs or vetoes it. If a president doesn\u2019t like the law, he can ask Congress to change it, but he can\u2019t decree that he will ignore the plain language of a statute.\u000a\u000aOn April 16, 2017, CNN reported, \u201cIn a move that could allow him to roll back the protection of lands designated by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that reviews enforcement of the law that gives him power to designate lands as national monuments.\u201d The problem is that Trump, nor any other president, does not have the power to revoke the designation of lands as national monuments because of the clear language of the law governing these designations.\u000a\u000aThe Antiquities Act, passed in 1906, is the statute in question. Section 2 of the law states in part \u201cthat the President of the United States is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.\u201d There is no provision for the president to withdraw designations of prior presidents of national monument status.\u000a\u000aNoted constitutional scholar and Reagan administration lawyer Bruce Fein wrote in the Washington Times on August 1, 2017, \u201cThe text, spirit, and 111-year history of the Antiquities Act of 1906 militate against presidential power to revoke a national monument proclamation made by a predecessor president. That conclusion does not disturb the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\u201d This analysis is spot on.\u000a\u000aSome conservative lawyers argue that the inherent powers of the president allow Trump to revoke or reduce prior designations. Attorneys John Yoo and Todd Gaziano write, \u201cWe are confident that, pursuant to this power to designate, a president has the corresponding power to revoke prior national monument designations, although there is no controlling judicial authority on this question.\u201d The text does not explicitly allow this, yet the two conservative lawyers argue that the president has the power based on \u201chis implicit power of revocation.\u201d The word \u201cimplicit\u201d is lawyer-speak for the idea that the statute does not allow action, but the president can act anyways.\u000a\u000aEven though there is an attorney general opinion on the matter from 1938 that concludes the president can\u2019t revoke these designations, Yoo and Gaziano further argue that the president has a \u201cgeneral discretionary revocation power.\u201d They cite that \u201cfive days before Christmas, the White House announced the withdrawal of millions of acres of Atlantic and Arctic territory from petroleum development. Obama continued his midnight orders by proclaiming 1.35 million acres in Utah and 300,000 acres in Nevada to be new national monuments.\u201d Congress could have prevented this scenario years ago by amending the law to prevent last minute designations, and they can change the law today if they so choose.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post reported that Obama invoked the Antiquities Act \u201cmore than any other president. He has created or expanded 34 national monuments, two more than Franklin D. Roosevelt.\u201d Conservatives were rightly upset at the overuse of the statute. Congress needs to change the law to change designations, not merely use some unpopular Obama designations to convince Trump supporters that the power of the president is unlimited.\u000a\u000aLaws preserve order and ensure that a new president can\u2019t rule the land through executive order. We are a nation of laws\u2014not men. If there is a problem with a law, change it.\u000a\u000aBrian Darling is former Sr. Communications Director and Counsel for Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
